Well it looks like youre completely determined I guess theres no stopping you given that you waited all of 23 hours for further discussion before reverting my reversion did someone mention an edit war Its a pity you arent prepared to engage with other editors or even familiarise yourself with the concept of consensus I was about to make some points but frankly I cant be bothered Its a small article there are few other editors interested and in cases like this deletionists always get their way Good luck with your future endeavours
