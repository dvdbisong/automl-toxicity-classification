Add name or delete article 

First I think there is absolutely sufficient proof that she is who people claim she is  Ex httpwwwnewscomaulifestylereallifedevoutcatholicdadreturnshomefromafghanistantofinddaughterisapornstarstoryfnixwvgh1226851020842 for a time this was the FIRST GOOGLE SEARCH RESULT for belle knox  That link has interviews with family members who are on record with their real names  I think thats definitive

Second her privacy should not be the concern of wikipedia  For one as a porn star she is showing her body to the world the concept of privacy is quaint  If Wikipedia was so concerned about respecting privacy wishes and not adding anything at all unless its 100 certain then large parts of the Satoshi Nakamoto article should be deleted as well

Finally she is only notable because her real name was revealed publicly  And if Wikipedia is unwilling to reveal her name then this article has no reason to exist  Delete it

I find the behaviour of some wikipedia editors not only reverting edits but DELETING THEM FROM HISTORY to be frankly Orwellian  We are at war with Eastasia Weve always been at war with Eastasia
