Im going to warn you again about putting the dispute tag on pages where you just want the title changed namely the Kurdish subarea articles as it is highly innapropriate As Ive said before if you want the title changed list it on WikipediaRequested moves The tag will do nothing to further this goal nor will your ceaseless edit warring to keep it there  0355 9
