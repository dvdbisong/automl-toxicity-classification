A few kind words
Obviously this is a subject thats intrinsically important  Its worth caring about and you care concern and dedication are good things  The challenge is to direct that energy into positive uses

Two years ago an editor approached me for help he had a block log an arm long seven edit warring blocks  He was working in an important but controversial area  We communicated  Tentatively at first then more closely  Not only has he never been blocked since then but hes become one of Wikipedias most prolific featured content contributors  He has since become a sysop at four different WMF sites is an OTRS volunteer and was recently reelected as an arbitrator at Wikinews  He still edits that same controversial topic and has written twothirds of its featured articles and good articles

What he told me about his blocks was this he treated them exactly as blocks are intended to bebreathing room  Hed go out get fresh air do other things  Then return relaxed and refreshed

I dont mentor anymore but if youd like to seek a mentor Id be glad to communicate with both you and the mentor  Best wishes 305
