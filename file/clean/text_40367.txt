3rd opinion
A read of this article gives me the impression that it is as much about the products offered as the company which is supposed to be the subject To me this makes it read more like a promotional brochure than an encyclopedia article In my opinion everything after the Trend Micro lawsuit paragraph up to the backscatter section should be condensed to a single paragraph or perhaps a list The inline citations are not really required if the website link at the end leads to the same info The backscatter sections read more like instructional material and are not particularly encyclopedic in tone I do not believe that those sections should be kept in the article Finally the external links section should have one link to the main website

I understand that my opinion is going to seem one sided to one of you at least but this is the way I see it I hope it is of some help
