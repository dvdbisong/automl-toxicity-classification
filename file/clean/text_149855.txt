The Godfray and Turner references say that the Moons annual path around the Sun is concave  Other reference like this one say that its convex  That seems like a conflict to me  Now maybe youll claim that the Godfray and Turner references are looking outward from the POV of the Sun and the other references are looking inward at the entire system and that explains the difference  But I still dont acknowledge a distinction between convexconcave when looking outward from the inside and convexconcave when looking inward at the entire system  Hopefully Marc will clear up some of that when he responds to my question above
