Dont be rude 
My edits are made in good faith and not out of a desire to sell political points They are not therefore POV  The sentence I deleted was written by me Was that POV  There is evidence for the existence of the house of david and therefore for David  I provided an up to date reference to a respected historian  There is hardly any evidence for anything from that time which isnt empireassociated  If you have a problem with the refierence fix it  Its easy to delte stuff not so easy to write it
