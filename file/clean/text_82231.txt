But surely it had something to do with his decision to hold the referrendum It showed that people wanted a reduction in members terms from 8 to 4 This is the option being given at the ref along with total abolishion which wont happen no way enough people will vote for it as well as leaving it as is The government is just being feasible by reducing half of the house as well because if they ALL came up for reelection every 4 years there would be 22 spots to give each election looking at the PDF report I would be very suprised if the referrendum result was anything but reduced termsnumbers
