Oh how very priceless  Quotes from the lot of you are going to be used in an oped piece that is currently under development and being written  I know that this doesnt phase you and I dont really care  But right is right and wrong is wrong and the emperor has no clothes  You state that you cannot rely on the editors so you rely on any published work  good or bad  Tell me  if I use the book A Treasury of Titanic Tales by Garrison will this book suffice as a source under the rules of Wikipedia  Serious question  Give it some thought  Let me know   0504 23
