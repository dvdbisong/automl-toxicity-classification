All maps agree There is no village there There are a few houses This is not a village and there is no point in adding a few houses to the map regardless of whether you call it a village or not Nor does it make any sence to add chains of villages that are literally right next to each other Add villages with some distance between and only REAL villages where there are actually more than 1 house inside the village Your missing the whole point
