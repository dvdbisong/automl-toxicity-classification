Appearances
Someone changed the trivia that Hiro is one of two characters to be in every episode to three the other being Mr Bennet I dont believe this is true and if it is its not on the others pages It also doesnt validate much its cool but thats it Why dont we say that Hiro is the only one to be portrayed by three actors for Young Hiro Present Hiro and Future Hiro None of it really seems to matter
