I dont have the time or inclination to really wade into this but Id certainly agree that Erhard and est are crucial to any honest history of the Hunger Project Is that being disputed Is he claiming that this is false or just that for some reason it isnt worth reporting There is a Mother Jones article from December 1978 that documents the connection well I read it at the time it was a good article worth tracking down and that at that time est was using Hunger Project as a recruiting tool Conversely according to  8 years later MJ conceded that the Hunger Project had severed those ties and was no longer recruiting for est    Talk 
 Erhard and est are crucial to any honest history of the Hunger Project This is not being disputed but the placement of this information in a crucial location and evident language is being disputed as are any links to all of the sources you have cited above including the Dec 1978 Mother Jones article among many other sources  The user has claimed that this issue is also not worth reporting as it is in the past but many other users have maintained that the full history of the organization positive and negative is definitely relevant  Thank you for the quick response
