Bkonrad great additions  The only question I have is how did you verify the counties it went through  I couldnt get an online detailed map that showed the counties  I think it may dip into some more   1525 Jun 11 2004 UTC

Thanks I also had a hard time with which boundaries it crossed This time I checked it with Mapquest The Michigangov site also has fairly detailed maps which I use more often but didnt this time for no particular reason wiser 1534 11 Jun 2004 UTC

Ahh yes those state maps are the ones I was looking for  M52 does indeed dip into a bit of Jackson county   1605 Jun 11 2004 UTC

Good catch  I had looked right at that very section and missed Jackson County wiser 1620 11 Jun 2004 UTC
