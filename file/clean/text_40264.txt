I can see you do have strict standards High standards Quite amazingly high when it comes to something you disagree with Alpine high Ah but when you agree anything goes I have cut out statements from this article that were not only totaly unsourced and obviously imaginary they were gross volations of basic physics They would embarrass Taubes Statements that mix up power and energy temperature and scale Ridiculous distortions and rumors and goodness knows how many unfalsifiable assertions And yet for some strange reason this stuff keep popping in again and it seems the authors are    skeptics

Strict hardly begins to describe it SM comes to mind
