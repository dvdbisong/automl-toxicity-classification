Response This is not about some random pipsqueaks idea of good writing style The CTMU article was in fact very well written until halfbaked policyviolating critics biased against its content began changing the wording and hanging spurious tags all over it Nor is this about your opinion of the content of the article or the CTMU itself Take your unverifiable nonneutral opinions to the mens room wall  theyre irrelevant and Im tired of reading them
