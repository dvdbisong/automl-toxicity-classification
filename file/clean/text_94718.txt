Thanks heah This is helpful

Something to consider is that the references you pointed to  which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS also that subsequent research has not supported the same results

The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS or more specifically to Kaposis sarcaoma is that they are very weak in terms of data presented  The results have not been repeated by other scientists  In fact within the list of referenced studies there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers

The general consensus in the research community and in the HIVAIDS community is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIVAIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposis sarcaoma KS
