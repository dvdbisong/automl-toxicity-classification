No Im not Its sad you cant see that I will repeat as you dont seem to get it The only reason Wereith was found was because of my socking As such my infraction is minor compared to his massive violation  despite the multiple bans both arbcom and community and all the other disruption he returned as a sock and has managed to perform several thousand hundreds of thousands maybe of edits as such If it wasnt for people like you and the admins and functionaries whose names you are trying to hide from the community with these reverts who seem to have absolutely no capacity for common sense or the common good that could have been kept to a couple of thousand No wonder Werieth thought he would chance his arm at a return  he obviously knew what you can achieve if you simply defeat CU and have a few admin mates With this bizarre attitude that all socks are ebil the rest of the community pretty much ensures such an attempt has a good chance of success I dont mind admitting I considered dropping this a couple if times not because of scumbags like Future but because of people like you but I thought better of it In the spirit of IAR Ill always try to help Wikipedia in the task of exposing serious violators of the SOCK policy You can help me or hinder me but the fact is as this case shows youll never stop me
