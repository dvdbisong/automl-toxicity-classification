We do know exactly who is Phd Rimantas Zizas  he is a scientific associate of Lithuanian Institute of History  he is also member of The International Commission for evaluation of the crimes of Nazi and Soviet occupations so i doubt that allegations on bias do apply 
Also I do not like seeing books attacked rather than providing exact citations from reviews  what errors what authors what article in the book criticized for what General accusations of book being antiPolish or even whole country historiography as biased does not work its not evidence its WPPOV
