Next Good Article candidate 

So whats the next article you want to work up to GA status I actually LIKE writing footnotes and finding sources for stuff I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night Might as well add my services to whatever youre working on next   Talk 

Well given your area of interest why not American Quarter Horse  DlhStablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally  That might be another possibility  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work  Have you looked over the criteria yet   

 Briefly I looked them over I recall that they need lots of citations in depth and with enough picturesdiagrams to make things easy to understand for the noninitiate Im sure there is a lot more Ive got books on the vet or training side of things but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history Youve obviously been working hard on things with the horses and I figured Id rather work with you than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker I would think Of course Im still new at this but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much honestly Id have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed and the history of the controversies behind the registry and  well you get the idea Oddly enough given my Quarter horse interests I own Arabians grins so Id love to see the Arabian article make Featured but Im scared to ask how much work that would take Anyway now that Ive babbled Im more than happy to watch you work and help however I can Certainly dont want to work at crosspurposes   Talk 

The internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff most generic horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies  The breed registry web sites are often much better though they arent above POV at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus which is a wholly unverifiable claim   You want an easy job go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article  Most in there are stubs and need expansion some are red links that arent even real breeds For example you dont want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the Egyptian Arabian is a different breed BTWgrin so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief  Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse dont ask me how  I got Arabian horse pretty much to GA status singlehandedly but it took awhile editing it from a disaster of antiArabian POV to GA status over a period of several months learning all the way  My panic about putting it up for FA I actually think its almost there is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with for example the controversies section almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion  Its needed  Im not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesnt totally screw it up or worse yet restart battles that were settled a long time ago  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished I basically had it ready for GA in about a week with a few contributions from some other editors like
