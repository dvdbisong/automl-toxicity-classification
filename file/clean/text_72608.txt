Time of Day
The Who performed it just as the sun and almost half a million concert goers were rising on the third morning of the festival

Oh really OK Then can you explain why the concert footage shows them playing in the black of night Did those five hundred thousand rise before dawn Go here and see if you can see anyone rising or any sign of morning Then if you know something that defies the imagination of others CITE IT
