Re  Silent Films 

By some virtue Ive been addressing errors in the historical record and submitting corrections to different venues for all matter of silent film works I am liking how later productions by most companies have plenty of images and background works to go by As long as errors like this exist Ill have to be on my toes Im sure you know the whole Verifiability not truth and no original research but some original research quickly clears up such errors and shows how prevalent they are in almost all topics So much of that film still is totally wrong It is Robert McWade in the 1912 Vitagraph production Zoom in if you dont believe me Ive actually submitted several other film still identifications but I dont want to be a pain Most people know Wikipedia is not infallible but most people dont understand that so many books and other sources are also very flawed Only 1000 Thanhouser films left to go   

Oh yes you have to be very careful even otherwise reliable sources get it wrong
