Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum
At all times with each division the length of each part shortens by a half
while at the same time the number of parts multiplies by two
So how can an infinite number of parts
make up a finite whole Because for every division the lengths
of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing   2128 9 August 2012
