Hello

During The Dangerous Tour in 1993 Michael Jackson had planned to visit Mexico The initial dates for the concerts in Mexico City were planned to be as following 29101993 31101993 2111993 4111993 and 6111993 The first 2 concerts were done as planned

Now Jackson had problems with his health and the last 3 concerts were postponed The dates for the last three concerts were then set as following 7111993 9111993 and 11111993

There were also some minor plans to take Jackson also to Monterrey after Mexico City dates but these plans were then cancelled because Jackson cancelled the whole tour on November 12 because of ill health

Now please do not any more change the fourth Mexico City concert date It was planned to take place on November 4 not November 3 Please also read Lisa D Campbell book which has been mentioned in the article
