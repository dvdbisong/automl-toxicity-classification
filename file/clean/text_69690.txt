Wikipedia welcomes pictures even if they are not from the serious sources Pictures are the exclusion from the rule that one cannot add a personal content to Wikipedia I thought the same applies to the link to the websites containing only mere pictures nothing more and so did wwwgaryckicomnationalparkshtml  
If the content in Polish on the website wwwgaryckicomindexhtml contradicts the above statement the website can be split between two independent domains although still mutually linked why not  one of which will be dedicated to the national parks
I would at least leave the link on the List of national parks of Norway pages because you cannot find a better photo guide to ALL national parks in this country including the planned ones even on the government wwwdirnatno pages The same applies to Poland and maybe Sweden at least to Laponia Please also note that the Cathrins World is also a personal website but nobody even attempts to remove the link to this website nor do I
Some links may also be helpful with the less popular national parks such as Anderdalen or LomsdalVisten etc
Please reconsider readdition of the links
