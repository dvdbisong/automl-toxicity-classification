Yes there is

If one clicks on the History tab at the top of the article one can see any comments or explanations that the editor has made when summarising their edit

In this case I was the editor that changed the wording back to what had been the consensus for some months My edit summary was British Isles included in section heading so no confusion please see British_Isles_naming_dispute

Its not just Irish Nationalists that are a wee bit too sensitive about the term and in this case the subheading of British Isles should dispel any lingering confusion  as does the internal linking or redirection of The North East Atlantic Archipelago

If after reading the referenced article you are still unclear as to the rationale for the use I can try and explain further but I hope the article will explain the term NEAA also includes twiddly bits like the Faeroes and the Channel Islands that are generally excluded from the ambit of the British Isles Thank you for your interest in making Wikipedia a better encyclopaediakiwiexile at DMOZ
