Cryptic I think this was a really bad block but I dont think you should resign However I think it is important that you make a comment at the ANI discussion Whether its to say you stand by the block and explain your block rationale or to say that you made a mistake and wont do it again whichever is the case I dont think this going to go away otherwise and Im concerned that if you dont come and talk there it will end up snowballing Please consider Thanks Sarah
