WikiProject assessment tags for talk pages
  Thank you for your recent articles including Partita Penderecki which I read with interest When you create a new article can you add the WikiProject assessment templates to the talk of that article See the talk page of the article I mentioned for an example of what I mean Usually it is very simple you just add something like WikiProject Keyword to the articles talk with keyword replaced by the associated WikiProject ex if its a biography article you would use WikiProject Biography if its a United States article you would use WikiProject United States and so on You do not have to rate the article if you do not want to others will do it eventually Those templates are very useful as they bring the articles to a WikiProject attention and allow them to start tracking the articles through WikipediaArticle alerts and other tools This can help you too as the WikiProject members will often defend your work from deletion and try to improve it further Feel free to ask me any questions if youd like more information  reply here
