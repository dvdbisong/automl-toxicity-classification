Categories in Being and Categories Manifested 

Not to reinvent the wheel but it seems atom of category content is article titleeach atom can have one or more membership tags
The membership tags EACH indivdually IMPLY a category for example for author Xysys
writers
American woman
novelist                                          shortstorywriter                     essayist     criticism
historicalnovels commedyofmannersnovels      postmodernshortstories  childernsshortstories

Rather than a fixed list of Catagory articles the user is served a page of tags that gives the ability to drag and drop to build a category And then that intersection is created  And served to the user with the index bar to choose by initial letter of last name of the author article In the simplest case that might be all writers a potentially gigantic list BUT ONLY ONE PAGE IS RETRIEVED AND SERVED  More complex intersections require more preprocessing but a shorter potential list but still just 1 page served Statistics will quickly identify the most used sets of intersections and THOSE sets will be preprocessed ahead of need  A user can build onthefly a category of American Old White Men Agrarian Movement Novelists  as easily as a category of PostFeminist Puertoricano Independencias Novelists  There will be a system learning curve that results in the most requested categories being preprocessed and readytogo

The user should have the ability to save the list of intersecting categories for further use  And of course an Advanced Mode could include boolean operators allowing queries like American Women Novelists who do NOT write childrens books

From what I see now IF I see correctly categorization puts a big burden on categorizers who evidently can be pretty divorced from the subject matter  How much better a tag system more or less under the wing of the appropriate subject group  I really think this kind of approach might be about as neutral as categorization can become  It might be interesting to try this in a relatively small field say American Novelists
