Atkinson Vehicles Ltd 

Please dont be offended that I have migrated the work you put in to a new location in Seddon Atkinson  It really needs to be there as a part of the history of the company instead of in an article on its own  the redirect which I have reinstated solves any problems for people looking for AVL and search engines will find the article anyway and perhaps better because its a single larger article

I think it still needs work and since you seem to be knowledgeable in that area hope you will pick up the challenge of making it an excellent article  Im not a subject matter expert I just made some copyediting decisions
