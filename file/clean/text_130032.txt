Id just like to point out that Ohmefentanyl has an isomer F9204 that is 13KX morphine There is also an siomer mixture of Ohmefenanyl that has a reported potency in the region of 2050KX morphine More recent studies point to analogue such as fluoroOMF that is even more potent Perhaps a new section needs to be opened up to clarify this as clealry there are is some controversy over the strongest opioid or at the very least we are not 100 clear on the issue
