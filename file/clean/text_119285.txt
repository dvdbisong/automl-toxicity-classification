Ah yes  You two know that it probably isnt prudent for me to say much about him now

Instead lets take a different tack okay  
A challenge to those at WPAN
A number of people have been discussing various moves by me  In an attempt to help clarify the issues I respectfully issue the following challenge
Go to WikipediaRequested moves and make a request for Eduardo Perez to be moved to Eduardo Pérez providing the proper discussion space on the talk page in accordance with the instructions at WPRM etc
Then give everyone who has commented about my moving articles should be given a chance to weigh in on that requested move  Put together all that collective brainpower and more importantly all that spirit of cooperative editing to work to try to resolve the question of which of those two names should occupy the unique spot available for the articles name in accordance with our WikipediaNaming conventions
Consider what you could support based on the article as it stands today with nothing specifically identified as a reference but with two entries under External links to statistics pages  Based on what I could see in other words
Look for and discuss additional sources of information to support either the Eduardo Pérez spelling or the Eduardo Perez spelling
Add appropriate references to the article if they are reliable sources
If anyone who has commented about me in this regard hasnt jumped in of his or her own accord within a couple of days seek them out and specifically invite their input to achieve the best cooperative result
This will provide a wonderful opportunity to teach by example
Then no matter where it ends up we will probably accomplish one thing  Those who want to talk about naming conventions issues will at least have some little bit of experience with and understanding for the potential issues involved

History  This article was started with the name Eduardo Perez more than two years ago and remained that way until moved to Eduardo Pérez without discussion and no edit summary here 10 Oct 2007 by UserKolins  Later I moved back the undiscussed unreferenced move of the longstanding name There have been no edits since and TalkEduardo Perez is a blank slate unused but for the ubiquitous WikiProjects and BLP boxes filling up a couple of screens

Or perhaps it would be even more instructive to add one additional step first  Let Husond first show you how an old pro one well versed in the workings of Wikipedia would handle this  Let him first move it back to Eduardo Pérez then request page protection on the page  Then once that page protection is in place you can request the move in the opposite direction from Eduardo Pérez to Eduardo Perez

Same encouragement of participation by anyone involved in that WPAN discussion of course no matter which direction the move is requested  All that changes is the burden of proof something Husond is well aware of but might not have been considered by everyone else It might have some effect on the ensuing discussion or not I cant predict what will happen in this case Leave the discussion open for the normal five days or more with of course anyone who is following the article just because they are baseball fanatics or whatever free to jump into the discussion as well

That discussion of course ought to be able to proceed quite smoothly and amicable since you wont have to worry about a disruptive character like me jumping in there 

Does that sound doable  Either direction I dont care  You choose   1913
