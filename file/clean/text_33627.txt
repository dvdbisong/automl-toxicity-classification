Universally Positive 

Hi I think it depends where you place the emphasis  I agree that the game has universally received positive reviews but universally positive could be taken to mean that each review was universally positive ie without criticism about the game which is clearly not the case the next paragraph shows that  So semantics notwithstanding may I have another attempt at nuancing this Thanks
