It looks better than what was previously described but it still is very light on source material only one source for the article Additionally the article could use some factbased expansion of the material to read more like an encyclopedic entry To me it seems to be a series of poorly documented bullet statements at the beginning and also needs little corrections such as stating a persons full name before referring to them by title and surname only
