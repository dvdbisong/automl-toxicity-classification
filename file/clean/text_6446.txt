We might want to consider redirecting it to Health applications and clinical studies of meditation Meditation therapy seems to be an uncommon term in clinical applications and doesnt in my mind deserve an article Im somewhat familiar with research on health applications of mediation and Ive never seen that term used If you do a search on that term in the Pubmed medical index it only brings up 3 results and none is an empirical study but are instead generalized discussions By contrast a search on the term Transcendental Meditation brings up 262 studies and mindfulness meditation brings up 81 studies
