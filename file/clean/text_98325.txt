Sure thing my friend if you read my first message you will find i provided a wikilink called REDIRECT you can learn all about that there Its quite simple man right now the articles name is VALENCIA CF and unless someone changes it to VALENCIA CF it can be done by registered users like me and you it creates a series of problems with the mentioned redirects Also i would not change it because it would be too much trouble changing all the articles and i guess there must be hundreds from CF to CF

Hope i helped whistle if you need anything although i must admit i am not a big knowitall of all this stuff cheers
