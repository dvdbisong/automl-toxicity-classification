Ive now commented on your comment about the image on the Cypriot Britons discussion page The web page of the National Federation of Cypriots says it represents 300000 Cypriots living in the UK This does not mean that there are only 300000 Cypriots living in the UK It means that the people it represents which are mainly Greek Cypriot community organisations number 300000 It presumably added up the numbers of its member organisations and came to that figure which is almost overwhelmingly composed of Greek Cypriots since the National Federation of Cypriots has barley any Turkish Cypriot members
