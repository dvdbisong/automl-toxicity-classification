Black Bat 

Im mystified how this was an abuse of dabs If the pulp character deserves an article as you imply then we would need a dab whether the article exists yet or not I changed the page because I was hoping to find information on the character There was none I suppose I can make a stub if you prefer but changing the dab back to a redirect was not helpful to anyone seeking information Itll still require disambiguation you know
