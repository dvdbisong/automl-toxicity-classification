Harut Grigorian 2 

I noticed you didnt reply so I figured you didnt see mine CP Original discussion

Would you please undelete this page Its been edited by other people other than the creator and is a useful page about a growing star in the sport The creator made this before heshe was banned and its only benefical to the wiki  
The creator a sock puppet of  at the time and the article has had no significant edits made by others I have no problem with somebody else recreating the article but I cannot entertain such a request to allow a user who knows that he can get away with it to allow his edits to remain MuZemike 
Why was he banned in the first place and his 2012 and 2011 in kickboxing pages removed If you cant tell me I understand but he seemed to just be trying to contribute Is there any way I can view the former article to help me create a new one As you probably know its quite time consuming   
 
Please reply to this soon All I want is to put up an article of Harut Grigorian Its not asking that much
