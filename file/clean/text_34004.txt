A few notes on assembling a DYK queue 

Thanks for all your work assembling these queues but may I suggest that you review the list of unwritten rules for these  Among other things they advise that each queue should be roughly half biographical hooks roughly half USrelated hooks and should end with a funny or quirky hook to leave em laughing  I know this makes putting a wellbalanced queue that much harder but its how its done Im told for the best interests of the reader
