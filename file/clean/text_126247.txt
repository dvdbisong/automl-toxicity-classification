Ive have in the travels here on Wikipedia stumbled across some accounts that had been banned and in each case the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect If not improper might I be told

I edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because in the state it was in it was jumbled and confusing obviously such things are IMO Also part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article are  that was sought by other before me to be protected and to remain unchanged and part of the hidden notes message was put behind the word are in what is a separate hidden note a factor I saw as being counterproductive but concerning which I also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two  but few words were best IMO  in the part before the word are

Editor EscapeOrbit the person I understand is claiming that he was threatened now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been thereEscapeOrbit in his talk page comment of 1442 8 February 2010 wrote The facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while  I believe it is doing the job intended httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleTalkQueen_banddiffnextoldid342616216  However the same EscapeOrbit on January 20 2010 on the talk page for Queen said The wereare please note this is the same are in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above in the lead  and dates in the info box get changed almost daily and have done so for years Please see the full entry in context in the footnotes where you can see EscapeOrbit is saying this in response to another readers encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a Good Article candidateIve put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it In the next few days I intend to nominate this article as a Good Article candidate however I feel work still needs to be done I will be making major improvements to the history segment of the article I feel we also need to develop a Further Reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article Any contributions no matter how small would be sincerely appreciated Lets do Freddie proud and get this to Featured Article status TheStig 
I fear youll not get very far with a GA nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether Queen still exist or not The wereare in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily and have done so for years Is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this Escape Orbit   emphasis added or the page itself if you prefer httpenwikipediaorgwikiTalkQueen_bandNationality

The hidden message was by EscapeOrbits own words having no good effect We had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a GA candidate see footnotes With my edit of 1643 7 February 2010  I included this edit summary expand existing important note with new footnote both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few wordshttpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleQueen_banddiff342506929oldid342389811 The important note I addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the are The purpose intent and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message

EscapeOrbits reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having what are in his opinion  and interestingly enough I dont disagree here British subject matters use British English He writes about this phrasing precious to him that it is It is similar to a note that I frequently attach to British musical bands articles   emphasis added He is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect The problem is that he has posted frequently and so like a beloved child even though he says its not working he isnt about to have anyone change his baby

My changes to the hidden message are those words in bold are DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO IS OR WERE Are is the correct UK primary compulsory education reading level
