YouTube Links 
 This article is one of  thousands on Wikipedia that have a link to YouTube in it Based on the External links policy most of these should probably be removed Im putting this message on the talk page to request the regular editors take a look at the link and make sure it doesnt violate policy In short 1 Because the source and legitimacy of videos  on YouTube is almost impossible to determine almost all of them are not reliable sources and are not verifyable 2 Many videos on YouTube are of questionable copyright which should not be linked to from Wikipedia If you are not sure whether the link on this article should be removed or if you would like to help spread this message contact us on User talkJsmithYouTube Linklist Thanks
