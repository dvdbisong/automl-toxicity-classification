Wikipedia and its anticommunist bias

Funny thing one can edit the article related to the mass killings that occurred under anticommunist regimes but no edits can be done here Also it should be noted that the above mentioned article has a neutrality tag but this one does not its quite obvious why it happeens As a fellow Wikipedian I demand that the Wikipedia anticommunist administration put such tags here too since its heavily biased and counts only with anticommunist references

 Talk to me and prove your point instead of deleting this
