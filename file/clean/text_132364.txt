This article has survived the notability check back in 2009 when it survived AFD at a time when the article was short atrocious and POV  In the last month I have tripled the character count and citations from 10k24 refs a lot bad to 30k 62 refs all relevant and reliable  Despite two people that keep putting back the issue tags NEITHER of them as actually ADDED a new source or information  They are not interested in improving the article only keeping the tag spam in place to deface it
