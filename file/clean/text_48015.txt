WrestleMania XIX
Two points

1 This event is not a tenant of the facility and should not be listed as such

2 The attendance figure cited is from a WWE press release WWE has a history of inflating attendance figures they still claim 90000 at the Pontiac Silverdome and newspapers have an annoying habit of simply repeating what WWE claims in their press releases 

Since the pro wrestling cabal here has been rallied to threaten and intimidate anyone who dares to touch their articles Ill be backing off for now but others should be able to insert some sanity into this discussion
