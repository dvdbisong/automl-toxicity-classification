In regards to your edits at Acid3 you are invited to the discussion at the articles talk page  Please discuss before changing the caption as it has been explained numerous times that the caption describes the image  The image is for Mozilla Firefox 60a1 NOT Mozilla Firefox 80a1  If you wish to have the image updated go for it and upload Mozilla Firefox 80a1 the image and caption can then be updated  However I ask that you please not continue merely changing the caption as it is incorrect  It doesnt matter how many times you change it it will be changed back  If you persist the page may be semiprotected to prevent further disruptive IP edits  Thank you
