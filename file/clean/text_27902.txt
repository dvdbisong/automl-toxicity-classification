OK I dont get why numbers which are used to justify something controversial like VE even as an example only are not kept somewhere It gives the impression that they are invented to impress us even if the save mechanism of VE could be included in wikitext editing anyway if that was the major improvement the WMF saw which rather backfired since they seem to be wrong If the WMF wants us to trust them again they will have to do better than this   0701 9
