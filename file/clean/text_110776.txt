I have to register my shock at your outburst  There is nothing on this page or anywhere else that can even remotely be construed as a personal attack on you or on anyone else  I do question some of your actions past and present however and the motives behind them  If the actions cannot be validated by you and by UserCharles Matthews on the grounds that derive their validity from Wikipedia policies then what is their foundation  The difference between a private person and an editor here is that here your actions must be accountable to the houserules and cannot merely be grounded in your feelings which now get the better of you  And I question your actions severely I think you are at bottom a good person really and should not let my censoriousness provoke you to display of anger  Answer on issues only if there are points I do not understand state what they are how they are wrong etc do not hide behind dismissive Iamnotinthebusinessofgivingyoututorials etc such tactics are insulting not merely to me but to the project as a whole   Prof02
