Your recent edits to Sarah Jezebel Deva removed sourced content without explanation In addition you added content without giving any sources Some of the content you added was your own subjective assessment eg very approachable and some of it was promotional eg join her online Unfortunately this means that your editing came into conflict with several of Wikipedias guidelines and has been reverted I strongly recommend looking at the guidelines on reliable sources neutral point of view and what Wikipedia is not before editing the article again Also please do feel welcome to take up the offer above of contacting me on my talk page if you want help
