Michael Jackson 

About the new song Im not going to debate you about this because there shouldnt been any doubt in a few days But I think youre being far far too strict in your inclusion of information here We dont have an exact confirmation by Michael Jackson that he sang the song Thats because as far as I know there wasnt much doubt A singer is not going to release a statement Hey I sang this song everytime a song that is suspected to be his is leaked I doubt any singer will do that much less Michael Jackson And if Billboard Magazine and MTV news could confidently claim that it is sang by Michael Jackson there is no doubt whatsoever This similar reasoning should be applied to other things as well Wikipedia relies on sources only when common sense does not suffice We dont need exact statements on everything to merit their inclusion or notability I know youre trying hard to make a FA out of that article but you cant have a FA where a chunk of the persons life is missing simply because you dont like the sources enough
