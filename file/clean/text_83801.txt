Award
From your userpage you seem like a cool guy so I am hereby bestowing upon you the I like you cuz youre a cool guy award Use it as you see fit I dont have a picture to go along with it so heres this poem by Aleister Crowley I thought you might like instead
I am that I am the flame
Hidden in the sacred ark
I am the unspoken name
I the unbegotten spark

I am He that ever goeth
Being myself in the way
Known that yet no mortal knoweth
Shown that yet no mortal showeth
I the child of night and day
I am never dying youth
I am love and I am Truth

I am the creating of Word
I the author of the aeon
None but I have ever heard
Echo in the empyrean
Plectron of the primal paeon
I am the eternal one
Winged and white the flowering rod
I the fountain of the sun
Very God of Very God

I am he that lifteth up
Life and flingeth it afar
I have filled the crystal cup
I have sealed the silver star
I the wingless God that flieth
Through my firmamental flame
I am he that daily dieth
And is daily born again
