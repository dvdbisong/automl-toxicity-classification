Your Mistake on Iron Man 3 page 

The mistake that you made was putting Gwenethe Paltrow 2nd and Rebecca Hall 4th Thats considered an act of obsessing on women Kingsley is second since he is playing Iron Mans arch nemesis Mandarin and I suggest that  once I fix the line up you and other useres are not to screw it up until the trailer or posters are released
