Grievance 

Dear Mr Jimmy

Just to let you know that all is not well on wikipedia Almost all senior editors have started acting like autocrats and dictators Many genuine facts are just not being considered for discussion and are unreasonably termed as soapbox or POV and deleted This is definitely killing the spirit of wikipedians and the credibility of wikipedia This needs urgent attention
