After World War II the INA was on the losing side and did not exist as a ground force anymore  All its surviving members were treated as freedom fighters by the Indian governement after independence however none were reinducted into the Indian Armythus as a force the INA did not evolve into the Indian Army but ceased to exist However the force that defeated it the British Indian Army was in existence and the officers and men went on to form the Indian Army So its hard to agree that the INA was a predecessor Not when the Army that beat it went on to become the Indian ArmyYou can say it predated it  but it was not a predecessor to the Indian Army
