I did not say Goth Metal I said Goth Rock and I will point out that Evanescence has nothing to do with Gothic metal nor Goth Rock They fall more into the Alternative rockmetal genre There sound has nothing to do with Goth Rock So Im not going to take much from Gregor Mackintoshs interview Yes Evanescence is big but to place them in with real Goth Rock band or real Gothic Metal band is a slap in the face to those bands9822421186
