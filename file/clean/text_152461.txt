Having done some research on MEND and other east African insurgent groups since my first edit in late April Id be happy to see legitimate counterarguments against MENDs activities Unfortunately I havent been able to find any it really does look like this is a situation where they are the least bad of multiple organizations doing questionable things and I think the article should represent that We shouldnt shy away from discussing what they do wrong armed insurrection for one kidnapping and holding of innocent hostages for another but the fact that Shell is up against the Alien Tort Law in US courts right now for the alleged despoiling of the Niger delta might yield better information as to this issue as it wends its way through discovery and trial
