The Bereans 

I did some research and I have to agree with you that it is only this Bereans website that is openly labelling Sorianos group as a cult Who are these Bereans anyway They are completely unnotable and I am yet to encounter anyone who actually belongs to this anticult group Chances are they are also a cult group or even a ghost religion one that exists only in the Internet I dont think that articles from the Bereans website qualify as reliable thirdparty published source as per WPRS If you remove all the Bereans references in the Ang Dating Daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a months time It is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias Quotes should be either from notable newspapers magazines and books selfpublished books not included As I will never use articles from Sorianos websites to criticize say for example the Baptist sect I would also not use articles from a Baptist website to criticize Sorianos sect The rules must be applied to all for the interest of fairness and equality
