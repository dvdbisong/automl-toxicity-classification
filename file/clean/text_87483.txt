Aetherometry 

Thought Id start dropping some commentary on editors actions in Aetherometry here Like this comment I left on Viriditas talk page after a particularly speedy recat

Dammit Viriditas use the talk page Do you even understand the article youre recategorizing This page was stable for 12 days WITHOUT the pseudoscience category until David Gerard came along and changed it with no justification Consider that before you edit 

which Viriditas deleted with this edit summary

Remove personal attack I understand that the article is pseudoscience

Wow How brave How honest How ethical How incredibly wellreasoned I replied

That was no personal attack that you deleted If you dont participate in the talk page and justify your view you arent demonstrating understanding of anything Ridiculous truly  

which he also removed Unbelievable
