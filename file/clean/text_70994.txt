Thank you again Im very much aware of and believe in verification and  citations are extremely essential for a project such as this one The thing is when it comes to highly contentious issues like a BLP or a historicethnicpolitical article at least a minority here use the WPRSbetter source tags and violate the WPNPOV Minuscule incidentscomponents are heavily manipulated and the whole picture is painted in a different color Lack of effective site monitoring of these topics or dedicated admins who take these articles up themselves is probably the cause I guess Anyways Fully have to agree with what you have to say Greetings talk  contr  mail
