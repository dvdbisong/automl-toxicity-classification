005 not wrong 

Your threats of blocking only make the situation worse  There seems to be near resolution on ANI and now you fan the flames

You should be fair  One possible thing you could say would be the user did make the edits despite denial  sometimes its better to correct the mistake and move on  Instead you attack me and Im the one who found the wrong information

ANI is for discussion  Blocking someone for expressing an opinion is wrong  It disrupts nobody to read what is happening  In fact if you do block you would use some false excuse like disruptive when the other user was the disruptive one  Mature administrators can resolve this easily  Immature ones threaten  

This is nearly resolved but please withdraw your threats
