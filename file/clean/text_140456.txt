The riddler
 Is a nickname my Dad says the gun was called back in his day though we are Irish so for some reason it may be a regional term  Has anyone else heard of this nickname for the Tommy gun8646249193  

The list is certainly not allinclusinve and is not intended to be that  Since your father uses the term its likely that others did as well Often these things are started in or perpetuated by novels and comic books  At any rate if you could establish that it is a noteworthy nickname then itd probably be appropriate to add
