Cleaning up 

Heres what Im about to do to clean up this messy page
First of all sporange does not rhyme with orange as clearly stated in the usage note I will be moving it into the list
Secondly the section regarding orange purple silver and month will be retitled Words with obscure perfect rhymes
Thirdly the terms bulb eighth elbow and of will be removed Here is my justification
No matter how obscure the rhyme if it has a perfect rhyme it must not be one the list Bulb rhymes with culb so it will be removed Simple as that
Eighth is a perfect rhyme for weighth an alternative spelling and pronunciation of weight compare heighth
Elbow rhymes with beelbow as was pointed out above
Of rhymes with love in American English and sov just look it up yes it seriously is a real word as well as thereof in British English
