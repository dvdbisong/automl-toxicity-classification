Proposed move 

Rename article as Manchester United 01 Arsenal 20 October 1990 and keep flags in teamsheets The article is about the match and the current title sensationalises one incident though that incident has made the match notable

I originally raised this proposal on WPFOOTY but according to WPBRD I should raise it here as I am seeking consensus although I do apparently have the right per WPBOLD to go ahead and complete the move immediately The objections to flags seem to centre on a view that the article is as the title would suggest about a brawl But as Ive pointed out above the article is about the match and I think it should be retitled to comply with other similar match reports in the First Division Matches category Ill abide by BRD here and leave this a week If no objections then Ill go ahead and move the article Thanks 

By the way as brawls go this one was handbags at six paces
