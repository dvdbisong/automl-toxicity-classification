 Krokodeilopolis 

Given the etymology of crocodile pebble manworm I conjecture that the Greek city name sould be Krokodeilopolis rather than Krokodopolis because the manworm morpheme of the latter seems overly syncopated
That would be good to correct but any references  

Article removed from WikipediaGood articles

This article was formerly listed as a good article but was removed from the listing because there arent any references  Otherwise its great   

I used entirely online sources when I wrote the article Since I have a bit of a bias against that I labeled the section external links But looking it over again the sources arent too bad  while it could certainly use some print sources and footnoting now that we have the new tags and the mythological sources are at best weak the technical information on the Nile crocodile is from reasonably strong secondary sources  

 Pictures of crocodiles 

I would like to add my page on crocodiles to your external links please

 Editing 

Some slight cleanup and rephrasing of Introduction to remove redundancies  

 No animal is safe even big cats

For some reason someone continues to add this sentence when it makes no sense in the context of the article The preceeding sentence states that elephants and adult hippos are safe from crocodiles so it is erroneous and contradictory Furthermore lions are listed among the animals in the next sentence so the big cat reference is not necessary This sentence should remain deleted from the page as it is redundant contradictory and overall not useful  

Maybe you are right Wording can be changed  

 Crocs and Birds 

The Egyptian Plover and Spurwinged Plover are both claimed to clean crocodile teeth A photograph of this behaviour would be useful
