Do you even read what people write on this talk page  OrangeMike has consistently supported you despite your willingness to attack him  He has never engaged in personal attacks and has tried to soften everyone to your opinions on many an occasion  He is also in fact not Madison centered but has repeatedly debated in favor of the nonMadisoncentric crowd  On this issue Miaers you seem to have alienated yourself  Everyone here is trying to remain civil yet you just go to your old ad hominem standby and call us obnoxious and ignore our questions in favor of your usual recall NPOV comments  Lets have a cup of tea and remember why were here Miaers  Cheers
