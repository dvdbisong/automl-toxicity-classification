Revisionism by a user 

I would like to request that Haldrik stop changing transliterations of Hebrew letters etc to his own system Most of these transliterations were based on discussions at WikipediaNaming conventions Hebrew and reflect the consensus achieved there

Haldrik I know you would not like it if someone came along and replaced many transliterations with another system say Ashkenazi Hebrew transliterations Please refrain from making these type of changes until they have been discussed at WikipediaNaming conventions Hebrew Eliyak TC
