DDP and 3nis

Even thougth is a gang in the United states in not crime related to DRThe crime they do is outside DR so that means they not part of the crime that goes on in DRSome of the youth in this gangs are from other nations not only DR Anyways we should write in the crime section only crimes that involve the NATION OF DR not gangs that impose violence out of DR 3nis and DDP are nowhere to be found in DR so why have them there You should put them in the Crime Section of NYC or In the Crime Section of Bostonetc but not in the Dominican Article
Do you understand what am trying to say
