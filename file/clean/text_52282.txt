Gurkhas and French Foreign Legionnaires are not mercenaries  
Hi Philip I see you reverted my change without responding to the reason I gave Basically my thinking is there is no single definition of what a mercenary is so the section on Gurkha and FFL needs to say according to which definitions they arent considered mercenaries
If their is some fundamental law of nature saying they arent mercs then why include them in the article on mercenaries at all Anymore than a section in the Birds article called Dogs are not birds 
Presumably it is included because there is some sort of controversy and as written it seems very POV 
For the record I dont think they are mercs but the section needs to be brought up to wikipedia standard
Regards
