No we arent The article talks about inserting 22 days before the last five days of February  the impliaction being that 22 new days were insterted and the days that followed formed a part of the monthy of February That is an idea I have seen in a number of places on USENET and would imply that a intercalarius has only 2223 days and b that the last days of the year before March would be part of February  again contemporary evidence says no It may be this is not what the article means but in that case it should say that February was shortened and followed by Interc of 27 days is that what you think it says Theres no discussion of the additional day by the way
