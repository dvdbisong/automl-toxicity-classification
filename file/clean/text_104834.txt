Happy to be of some help Its not hard to prod articles just write  Substprod A good reason this article shouldnt be here  And that is with the s and s  Actually I think speedy delete is much more practial its tends to be a situation where either speedy works or the more heavy AFD procedure must be invoked The problem is users who hang around to protect their articles are actually allowed to remove the prod but not the speedy template or the AFD But you got the links now
