Edit history merge possibly required 

Hey I noticed you moved the Iran assassination article to a more appropriate name although depending on how allegations play out perhaps the investigation is broader and the media will provide a convenient shorthand but i just wanted to make sure that any history from the prior page would be appropriately merged into the history of the new page to comply with licensing terms In other words Articles A and B were created and B was merged into A and then A was renamed to B which means that all of the contributions need to be registered in the edit history to comply with copyright requirements

Ive got no opinion right now on the name I was surprised how long it took to create the first article actually I almost did it myself but I think that in some time there may be an obvious confluence of a few investigations so they can be comfortably grouped under one heading In the meantime itd be good if we kept the contribution history all in one place as best we can to comply with the GPL etc
