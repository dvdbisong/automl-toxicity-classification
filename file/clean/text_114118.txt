GA passed
For an article about the borough it meets the GA criteria and can be listed Thanks for clarifying some of these issues I made a few minor changes fixing the organization I still think that moving forward the governance section needs to be reorganized deemphasizing the use of those multiple 2nd and 3rd level headers and adding more prose to make it come together into a discussion of the governance of the borough
