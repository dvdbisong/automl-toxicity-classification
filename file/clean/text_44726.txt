Mediation and request for unblock of ApothéCure IP address 6715413154 and 7619728194

I am in management for ApothéCure and writing to you on behalf of the owner Gary Osborn RPh CCN There are other items regarding our company that would be of use to the community as a whole in addition to the information you wrote  We should have rights to make comments and offer other helpful information regarding our own company and its history which dates back to 1991  

The items that you posted under Controvery are still under investigation and offer only one point of view This is why I edited this information It was my intention to gather articles and information that would offer a more complete picture providing both points of view as well as further information about our company

Your remarks also violate the rules for writing articles under Advocacy and controversial material that clearly states that you are not to write articles that advocate one particular viewpoint which this article does Wikipedia promotes neutrality This article appears to be biased against our company and does not offer any other viewpoint than negative articles that are under investigation

I am kindly asking that you unblock or allow me to add our own content ApothéCure is a worldrenowed compounding pharmacy with a history of providing patients and doctors with quality compounds since 1991 

If you have any questions you may contact me personally at 9728019133
