Juggalos gang 

You locked the article because a single editor was fighting everyone over his personal interpretation of BLP His contention was that the article was labeling the 2 men as killers but that they hadnt been tried Well they have been In 2011 both were found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life without parole The BLP issue he perceived is now moot The article should be unlocked so the info can be correctly restored and updated Could you take care of that
