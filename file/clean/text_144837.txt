Ok but first of all some Wikipedian Danes trying to hide dark corners of JyllandsPosten starting to become a tad annoying

Anyway here is the source httpmediaguardiancouksitestory0170350000html  It clearly indicates that editor used the prove an outcry in his email

You can see the pictures here httpwwwdagbladetnonyheter20060205456857html and I think that there is nothing offending in these pictures So if youre stressing a minor issue such as cartoons being unsolicited I would like to stress this point

About the double standard issue yes youre right maybe we shouldnt draw a conclusion but we can write Ahmed Akkaris spokesman for the Danishbased European Committee for Prophet Honouring opinion then You can find it in the same Guardian article

I hope that proJyllands Posten sentences are all checked against sources this carefully as well just to avoid the infamous double standards
