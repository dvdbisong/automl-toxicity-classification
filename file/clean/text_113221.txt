so all that needs to be measured is their importance and since it tends to be men that like to assert just how big and important they are the only dispute that remains to be settled is whether to measure volume or length Unfortunately taking the arithmetic mean of these may produce different winners if you are unconvinced compare the hypothetical data sets of 222 and 113 However in a flash of inspiration Ive realized that so long as you take the geometric mean both results will always agree Hey not only do you get to argue about naming disputes you get to learn some maths isnt Wikipedia educational Macedonian on the other hand will require me to measure neither length nor volume but genuine Macedonicity To this end I could travel around all areas and entities that have been declared by either side to be truely Macedonian and measure the Macedonicity of mens penises using my special patented Macedonicitymeter The risk is this wont be perceived as neutral because the losing side may claim that I have been measuring the wrong kind of Macedonicity The important point here I think there is actually is one is that sometimes its not importance which is at the heart of the dispute but historical and moral rights to claim the name Its easier when the other side isnt still around I dread to think of the rows wed have if the Albania in the Caucasus was still around to claim the name but if it is arguing about how big and important both sides are is going to help even less On an unrelated issue what language was that I was able to read and understand it  thank goodness for the Slavic dialect continuum  but still dont have the foggiest idea what language it actually was
