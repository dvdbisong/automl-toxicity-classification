Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvementsMiddayexpress I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need 

About the catholicism in Somalia here it is the exact words in the Tripodi bookIl vescovo di Mogadiscio don Franco Filippini dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40000 Somali cattolici frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dellUebi Scebeli my translation the Bishop of Mogadischu Franco Filippini stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40000 native Somalians of catholic faith consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle If we add that there were 22000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750000 there were no exact census we have to agree to what writes Tripodi 62000 catholics in Italian Somalia to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts or nearly 10 of the total population of 750000 Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden but most scholars agree in the 750000  800000 range

I have written that The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots that now amount to nearly 50000 descendants in all Somalia because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the followingLambasciatore italiano considerava luso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia Un problema che aveva generato secondo lui quasi 50000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta my translation the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties
