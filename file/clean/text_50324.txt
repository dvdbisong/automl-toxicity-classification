Hi thanks for your comments they will definitely be helpful in getting the article to a point where its appropriate for more general audiences and not just trained linguists To answer some of your specific questions
 fómhar has u in some dialects because the rule that mid vowels are raised to high vowels before nasals including the formerly nasal mh applies to ó in many dialects This reminds me that I didnt discuss that raising in the article at all so Ill add a new section about it presently
 F and bhmhv are often pronounced with the bilabial fricatives  instead of the labiodental f v Unfortunately the published sources arent very specific about when which versions are used The same is true for palatal vs palatovelar not that theres a huge difference between the two in the first place  any individual speaker probably uses both interchangeably without even hearing a difference
 Sometimes the standard orthography does a very poor job of representing a particular dialects pronunciation of a word In the dialect I got the info from scanradh happens to be pronounced as if spelled scamhradh The pronunciation of cam is kaum per the discussion of lengtheningdiphthongization before fortis sonorants
 Exactly how the fortis and lenis sonorants differ changes from dialect to dialect as I tried to show in the chart There isnt one unified pronunciation of the two types
 Images of the vocal tract like the one you link to are fine for consonants but not much use for vowels as the differences between nearby vowels are too slight to be easily seen in them Also they belong more on the pages about the sound in question than in this article
 Im sorry if your heart sinks at the word largely but this page really isnt intended to help you get from spelling to pronunciation Thats what Irish orthography is for This page is for describing how Irish is pronounced by native speakers regardless of the spelling The realizations of sh are also discussed at Irish orthography though some discussion of the alternations between h and ç would probably not be amiss here
 Ill see what I can find about stríoc Theres no epenthesis when cn gn is pronounced cr gr because epenthesis is found only in Munster and cr gr for cn gn is found only outside Munster
 at abstract level vowelinitial words all begin with either a front or back glide that triggers either palatalization or velarization Is there a way to determine what is being triggered in each particular case Well from the orthography yes if it starts with e or i palatalization is triggered if it it starts with a o or u velarization is triggered but from a purely phonological point of view no It has to be included as part of the lexical information of the word
 Alternation in the table refers to the fact that some forms of a word eg the nominative case have one sound eg a long vowel with other related forms eg the genitive have another sound eg a short vowel
