Hello friend 

Hello  I am also someone concerned about the Zionists systematic holocaust of the Palestinian people

As the people who control Wikipedia have systematically banned and blocked people like me and you every time we open our mouths I am limited in what I can say here to you without being blocked  I will suggest two things however

1 Check out the web site Wikipedia Review
2 Check out alternative wikis such as Red Wiki or Anarchopedia  Spend some time writing and improving articles on them during them time when you are or when you are not blocked here

Wikipedia was created by Larry Sanger and has a lot of good ideas in its inception  a wiki encyclopedia under GPL license the GFDL license etc  Of course Larry Sanger is no longer with Wikipedia and to avoid being banned I will avoid talking about what happened after that  Suffice to say it is extremely ideological and people like you who dont support the Zionist bloodbath are persecuted  It is also highly onesided for other topics as well  Too much so it is inevitable that competitors to Wikipedia spring up and I am sure they will be more successful  By contributing to these other wiki encyclopedias you hasten the end of the complete control over these matters that the Wikipedia cabal exercises now
