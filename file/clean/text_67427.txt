Oh I did not mean to give off the impression that you offended me Thats not what I was going for at all My message on your talk page was simply about my agreeing with you in not agreeing with Excuseme99 By your restoring the article to the edit before my recent one I simply felt that you were trying to get the article back to a better state than Excuseme99s edit which was clear Sure I felt that you had a problem with my tweaking of his edit as in you did not like either of the edits but I was not holding that against you I simply wanted to know why you objected to my edit of that part of the lead Thank you for explaining I did point out how I feel that my edit is different than the current one but I do not have a huge problem with the way that part of the lead currently is It has been that way for the longest now as I stated on Excuseme99s talk page

I very much respect you as well The work you have done on the Brad Pitt article has been fantastic as you know You are the one who came along and fixed it up so well and I appreciate that
