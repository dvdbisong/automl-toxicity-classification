Dont hide correct information instead help people get access to it 

Hi Tournesol Wikipedia have never been about consensus Wikipedia is about making new correct and useful information public for a brooder amount of people quicker and within a shorter time interval than ordinary dictionaries
This means researchers with a specific knowledge may help other people get access to it and speedup the expansion of the world mainstream knowledge I think you agree Its a god deed to share information even if this knowledge is regarded new for the ordinary layman and in the forefront of science
Wikipedia has never been about satisfying some perverse peoples needs to act as deputies for bureaucratic hegemonies 
For example It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you cant give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures
And do you Tournesol really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isnt based on his or her own knowledge including research
