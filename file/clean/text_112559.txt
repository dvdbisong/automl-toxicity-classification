Complaint about admins

Is there anywhere to file such a complaint apart from with other admins Who suffer from an obvious COI in judging their peers and friends I think that the reasoning and judgement that went into my sock puppet ban make you and the guy whose original block you affirmed unfit to be admins Please let me know to whom I can make out my complaint at the Wikimedia foundation

Best regards
