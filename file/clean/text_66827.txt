I wanted to thank you for looking at my unblock request  It honestly was just a space that I wanted to put things since I was trying to understand my blockI apoligize for my edit warring  it did get crazy  I was fustrated  I was trying to get him to contact me and was trying to find an adminsistrator to help but I am new to wikipedia I do not understand it fully  honestly my first impression of it is very poor  I held it high in regards to valuable information  I honestly do not anymore  I honestly feel it was kudos to me for making first contact instead of the constant undoing that was happening to the edits with no form of contact  The undo button is actually really easy to see it is out in plain sight or I thought it was  I really am a new user  Dont understand the protected you put on my page but I thank you for giving me a valid reason for my page being blocked  I would like assitance if thats ok  I wrote dreadedwalrus a please do not contact me again request Since he misreads everything I write it seems I understand these talk pages is where you put this sort of stuff is that correct  If not where Also should I run into a problem with him again  how can I contact an administrator or someone that can help
