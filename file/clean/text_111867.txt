Summary on all nine grahas
I have restored the summary on all the navagraha which an anonymous contributor deleted The value of having this information all together in one article is to save the user having to enter and exit no less than nine different articles to get even the most basic information even if that information is duplicated The information given in the table is simply insufficient and at least a paragraph on each graha is necessary if this article is to have any value
