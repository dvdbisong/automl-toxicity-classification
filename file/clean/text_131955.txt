In response to the criticism section I agree Also where are the criticism sections for all the other big artist entries I dont see any for Metallica although Im 100 SURE that many artists and fans and people have made ignorant critical reviews of their musical style And since I respond If they worked their ass off every day for hours playing training and improving their technique then training some more every day for thirty years now training at their instruments and becoming virtuosos What now Mr Bigshot says theyre too good to fully use their technical skills that they worked their ass off on in their songs Is Mr Bigshot justified to say it when Mr Bigshot hasnt done much of technically requiring music himself I consider bragging and showing off bad if you havent done work for it ie rich by heritage but damn it if you say that its showing off technique The band does not play Yngwie Malmsteen kind of mostly singleformula based music displaying only technique but every song is different in case the critics havent noticed Guess what Ive played guitar for only 2Â½ years now and I can play many of their songs What the hell My argument wins therefore it should stay like that  removed p
