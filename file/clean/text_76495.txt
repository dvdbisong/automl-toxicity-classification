Strong Oppose  While Autism and Aspergers are known to be related spectrum disorders there are very distinct symptoms involved  If DSM V does change its perspective on this in three years time then we can revisit this  but its certainly not the job of Wikipedia to prejudge that Quite the opposite in fact  The current DSM IV is the authoritative document  an unfinished draft of a possible future edition is most certainly not  There is no urgency here  we dont have to jump at the smallest news item  were here to take the longer more considered route  and that means revisiting this when DSM V is actually published and not a day earlier
