TemplatePortuguese overseas empire

HiIndon

I think you did wrong by removing the template I think it gives an important historic context Thats not excessive its complet And doesnt seems to me that anyone will think that the islands belong to Portugal Did you really got that impression Have you checked on how many articles of sovereign countries that template and category are And sometimes with even more related categories and templates
For example i dont think anyone will stay with the impression that Brazil is still part of Portugal
OK
Be cool
