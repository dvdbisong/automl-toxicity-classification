Emailing
I was following the postings on Curps page as I was leaving him a message I cant send email to anyone and its possible it might be connected with the email confirmation thing However my concern is  is this the same as what IMDb does and that every single edit I do results in me receiving a confirmation email Thats why I havent done it because otherwise my inbox would get loaded very quickly with such receipts Does this happen If it does then Ill just have to do without the function Cheers
