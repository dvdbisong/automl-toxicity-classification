article  Per above I note that she has caused many problems in trying to control this article  It is better if others who are more neutral and accurate take control  Thanks  Helen I am requesting that you voluntarily watch from the sidelines here 123222396  

 I dont see her trying to control the article she made a few reverts based on valid policy concerns Phrases like shouldnt be any need for more edits may seem like you dictating the terms and trying to control the article Expecting someone to stay out of editing an article is counterproductive in a collaborative encyclopedia especially if the other user is concerned about policies like WPBLP That being said if you disagree with any of her edits engage on the talk page like youve been doing already argue your case and gain a consensus if the changes are controversial Regards    talk 

Per the talk page HelenOnline has been a major disruption for the articles neutrality  I call for her to voluntarily stop editing this page  Her latest edits in addition to her earlier edits have been very destructive to this page 123222396  
Absolutely not Any more unfounded requests like this will be treated as harassment
