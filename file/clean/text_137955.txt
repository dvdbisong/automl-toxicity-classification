Now it seems that Freakofnurture is really hating me big time Not only did he indefblock my IP he also did the same to my username The last time I had contact with him here was when I messaged him on his talk page I thought leaving him alone would heal our relationship between each other but it only seemed to have festered I feel that if I responded anyway and I wanted to despite him telling me to leave him alone he wouldve blocked me also Now I feel like Ive been in a catch22

Theres some good news though
