Its also the way TIME magzazine puts it And no I dont write for Time so it is not what I said nor is it what your opinion is It meets WPRS and WPV Of course this article shouldnt be a soapbox It shouldnt be the battleground where FLG propaganda is apparently dominating I checked out Zhuan Falun myself today It wasnt as the CCP put it to be but it does mention flying It says that if you release all the locks in your body you will be able to fly and levitate People dont show it to other people because they cant levitate but Zhuan says that it is because others need cultivation
