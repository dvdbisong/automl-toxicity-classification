The following RfC was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all I trust that you will do the same Phil  

TalkRossville Staten Island  As part of an ongoing edit war  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as removal of spam These external links which had been part of the article since its creation are not spam and were unjustifiably removed One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island which is located in the neighborhood Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia but on his own interpretation of what is spam Id like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr Gronowski I will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute Thank you very much for your consideration
