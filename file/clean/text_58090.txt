Im not sure if its properly called fifth tuning or perfect fifth tuning or what but it does exist The octave is slightly sharper than twice the frequency but according to the book it sounds better that way because the first overtone of a piano is itself sharp I dont have a piano so Ive never tried it besides the second overtone is even sharper than the first stiff strings do that
