Can I suggest that because this article is also included in Wikipedia as a whole that the wording in this article and indeed the other articles of this type be amended to include that it is a Virginia area code  The included map is fuzzy and only really helps if you are familiar with the midAtlantic area  Its only when you look at the links that you find anything that refers to Virginia area codes
