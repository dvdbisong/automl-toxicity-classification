It only changed from a redirect to Mengü dab page to a redirect to the Japanese facial armour article and I proposed simply reversing that redirect which has been stable for about a year now  So initially someone thought it should redirect to the Mengü dab page as a simplified spelling  Oddly a user had already moved the article from Menpō to Mengu Japanese facial armour even though Mengu had not yet been created even as a redirect  That user has long since been blocked so we cant ask him why he needlessly disambiguated it but if he would have followed the usual protocol of using the most concise title necessary to be unambiguous it would have obviated this whole discussion  Do you know of anything else on enWP that could actually be the WPPRIMARYTOPIC of Mengu  Without a specific primary topic concern there is nothing to discuss   Diskuss   Beiträge
