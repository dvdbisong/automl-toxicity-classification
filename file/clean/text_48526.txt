Im extraordinarily relieved to see more editors weighing in Since theres such a labyrinth of words here Id like to summarize what other editors besides we two have suggested Limiting number of awards to between five and 10 have thirdparty citation that is not the Chamber of Commerce or the local paper and since towns and cities change to limit awards to those 10 years old or newer Since other cities Ive surveyed and noted in the discussion dont even have Awards section I feel Im taking a middle ground by endorsing this compromise 3Ton however has remained implacable and wont budge from his position May we address this compromise other editors have endorsed
