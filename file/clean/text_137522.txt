Response to your post 
First I was not posting a random insult It was the opposite in fact I was telling the person I was intending the reply to not insult me Looks like you were the one to immediately take it as a personal insult from a total stranger no less And then you respond by being rude and belittling First who the hell are you and then after saying I got the wrong person and theres no need for you to be rude you say sorry you didnt reach Candyland you probably shouldnt be surprised when people react harshly to being insulted Im sorry my response was to you incorrectly but even after saying it was a mistake you in fact insult me
