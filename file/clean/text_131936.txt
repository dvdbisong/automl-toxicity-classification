Merry Yule style holidays or whatever
Somewhat baffled by a puppys comment but usefully reminded of intention to express grateful thanks for several rescues over an entertainingly eventful year Even more disorganised than usual this year not least due to rushing about to get Darwin a wee gold star However an April snowfall here provided a handy backdrop and as a true Wikiholic havent seen much of the barber this year Anyway hope the puppy has frolicsome fun and a happy Hogmanay    talk
