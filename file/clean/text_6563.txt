I have removed the China section if in the future someone comes up with several reliable sources that state that certain events that happened in China  from whatever period  was a genocide then it should be included on this page but currently in my opinion there has not been enough scholarly sources presented to justify its inclusion It is better to have no information about a subject in an encyclopaedia wrong information I can NOT emphasize this enough There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative I heard it somewhere pseudo information is to be tagged with a needs a cite tag Wrong It should be removed aggressively unless it can be sourced This is true of all information but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons Jimmy Wales See WPPROVEIT
