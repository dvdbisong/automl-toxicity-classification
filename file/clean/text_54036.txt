The firmament is falsified by Maxwells Equations which show that Lorentz invariance must be the correct formulation of physical reality Many modern geocentrists falsely believe that MichelsonMorley establish the speed of light as the benchmark but they are mistaken Since the firmament is falsified in such a way it hardly makes sense to try to look at the purely GReffect of gravitational lensing in this context If the modern geocentrist doesnt believe in GR they necessarily dont believe that physicists have the capability of modeling the universe described by any sort of rotation 0007 23 Apr 2005 UTC
