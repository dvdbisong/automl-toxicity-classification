PDL Postseason 

Yeah Jon this season was tough all around They lost when it counted They lost at Fort Wayne early which cost them a fourth straight US Open Cup bid Late in the year they lost at home against London ref decided to steal the show late in the match so to speak and both games against Chicago all of which were crucial to playoff positioning A few of us went to the game in London to witness their last chance at a playoff bid they needed a win a draw was as good as a loss They had their chances but just couldnt finish as the game ended 00 Quite a disappointing end to the season Very frustrating Good luck to you and HUFC in the playoffs
