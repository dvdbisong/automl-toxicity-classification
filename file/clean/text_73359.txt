Cafe Racer 

Hi

Id like to be pedantic here Can you help me move Cafe racer back to Cafe Racer

A Cafe Racer is a Cafe Racer Not a Café Racer

Indeed they were originally spoken  Caff Racers  as they were used to race from Caff  pronounced Kaff  to Caff

Again this is a British thing EnglishEnglish rules apply Not a French thing If you want to be accurate and Wiki to be accuate do not apply  dictionary rules  unless you actually know  or were involved  with the actual history of these things and know that you are right

By all means have a link from Café for folk that get it wrong but emphatically there were cafe or caff racers

 Much the reason for this was that British typewriters did not have an e with an acute and Caff is where you wen for coffee and tea 

Thanks
