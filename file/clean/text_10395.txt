Wikipedia was wontedly a part of the story For me the unencyclopedic selfreference happened mostly with the links to diffs which are now gone Editors should be exceedingly careful however to only use secondary sources which themselves describe Wikipedias part in this story and not make personal interpretations which are not directly drawn from those outside sources otherwise accurate or not this would be original research which is outside WP policy
