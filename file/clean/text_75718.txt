OpposeThe current article on Oral Tradition is very long and seems to me to lack structural balance with parts of the article going into what seems to me to be minute academic detail about debated aspects of some viewpoint or other I think that before there is any move of material into that topic the Oral Tradition article needs restructuring to be more understandable to someone outside the field so some detail would be removed or be moved to new separate topics
