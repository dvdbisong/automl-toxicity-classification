Hi Enrico 

Thank you for your message and kind words theyre very much appreciated   
Thank you also for the correction youre suggesting I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations and then update this section later on Normally I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days However please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can as I am always striving to ensure there is a thirdparty source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia Of course if some of these 3rdparty sources are wrong then its going to be tricky
I also notice that you are a brand new user who has made your first edit today and to my user page So a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor In fact I wouldnt be surprised if your user andor talk pages get supdated very soon with a Welcome message from editors who like to take newbies  newcomers under their wings  
But if you look at my user page you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines such as the Manual Of Style WikiMOS May I also suggest that if you want some help in getting started as an editor you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user and talkpages You dont have to do any of these things but if youre interested and have the time then Il be happy to help you in your first steps So just let me know OK
Finally although I made quite a few changes to the Planxty article and especially to the Andy Irvine musician article one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not belong to any one editor we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming mine In my case I just happen to have been a Planxty and Irvine fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material mainly my collection of folk music magazines that proved very useful to update the articles I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums Then of course we need more photos but these are very difficult to include because of the copyright rules in Wikipedia
