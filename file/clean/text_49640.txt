If the KLA had a Tactical Victory they wouldve completed their strategic goal if they had a Decisive Victory they wouldve killed almost all the Yugoslav Army troops but the truth is they have killed around 50 or 30 or 45 Yugoslav Troops Just like the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia the NATO said they destroyed about 400 or 200 Armored Assault vehicles But the truth is that they destroyed only 22 or less vehicles The Yugoslav had Volunteers from Russia Greece and I believe Yugoslav volunteers NATO was involved but had about six Aircraft B2 1 F16 2 and AC130 2 I believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used but didnt inflict casualties but for the F16 I believe inflicted casualties 8 So Yugoslavia had less casualties than the KLA because regular troops are stronger than Militias or Guerrillas because they have better handling and training on weapons and hand to hand combat and have armored weapons and tanks and many more The KLA only had guns
