Actually  excellent point  That old article really was awful with lots of peacock terms and didnt actually say much  That said Will is used differently in philosophy some think of it as some active tangible force rather than simply inclinations like in idealism a general definition would probably only say Will is as noted by someone on this talk page so I tried to make it into a longform disambiguation page  Most people will click on Free Will and be done with it  Do you think that this satisfies the problem
