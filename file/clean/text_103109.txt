Great list 

This list is just great It is not perfect as it is but nowhere else in my life Ive seen a list of cognitive biases which affect so much peoples decisions Unfortunately most people dont think too much about them The world would certainly be a better place if everyone was aware of cognitive biases and thought more about the rationality in their decisions I dont know how to express in Wikipedia that an article is important to me I guess I am going to write it on my user page Congratulations to all editors who made this list possible
