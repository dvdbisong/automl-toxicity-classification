 Airbag Fatalities 

I removed this

In Europe the number of people not wearing their seatbelts is very small when compared to the US and Europeans are less likely to be obese As a direct result of these two points European airbags are less powerful than their American counterparts and are therefore less likely to cause loss of life than those fitted to American cars

Give me a break  If you want to reintroduce this please provide citations for every claim made in the paragraph  

Agreed  Ive heard the exact opposite regarding airbag deployment strength in factthat Americanmarket cars have less forceful airbags because the occupants are more likely not to be wearing their seat belt whereas in Europe the airbags can deploy faster more forcefully because its assume youre wearing a seatbelt   KeplerNiko

With exception to the Europeans being less obese bit Id probably agree with that first statement  sounds about right to me  

 Dates of Deployment

I take strong issue with the discussion of the dates of airbags first being used in vehicles especially since it seems to me that it violates WikipediaNeutral point of view  It seems to me that this article is Americancar biased a country whose automobile manufacturers are most assuredly not first when I think of those who were firstadopters of new safety technology

Particularly the line about Chrysler making airbags standard equipment across its entire line in 1990 makes it sound like Chrysler was the first manufacturer to standardize airbag installation  The next paragraph indicates however that US cars produced after 1 April 1989 must have either airbags or automatic seat belts latter is news to meit seems to me that the vast majority of manufacturers opted to install airbags over seat belt systems  However the way the article is written it seems like Chryslers actions were unique and most of all done out of its own initiative rather than being federally mandated

Quite simply Chrysler was neither the only company to take this step nor did it have a choice in the matter I think the line implying Chrysler did something innovative should be stricken   KeplerNiko

1970s Implication
The US experiment in the early 1970s ended pretty quickly as I recall Does the article mean to imply that this was ongoing   

Mainegov Link
Regarding link Mainegov  How do air bags work
Link has gone bad Found replacement link at  but
there is little useful information there As the link adds nothing to the article I removed the
link entirely  

airbags only reduce fatalities in those wearing seatbelts by 8 
Following up on an old point by Tekfiler the government does not want you to know this number since that would be clear indication of a collossal waste in terms of cost benefit analysis So  the stat is never called out The NHTSA page has some interesting data on how US highway deaths have been declining at a slower rate than in other industrialised nations If airbags were really all they are cracked up to be seems that would not be true  

It is also advised that you dont sit too close to the steering wheel because when the airbag inflates it will crush you back in your seat stopping you from inhaling cause your crest cant go out therefore stopping you from breathing

 Deleted Link 

I deleted the external link that was said to show a clip of an airbag exploding  This link was spam 

 Regarding age 
The article said children under 12 should always be in the back seat I changed it to 13 because a 12 year old could get killed by an airbag  2148 9 November 2007
