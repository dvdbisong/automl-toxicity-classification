This review seems to be even more fringe than the standard positive reviews for the following reasons 1 This review claims that the goal of the movie is to promote interracial relationships  and the perspective of the author is that interracial relationships are a bad thing  2 This blogger does not seem notable as a film critic etc to me nor is he quoting any primary sources  I dont think it would be an appropriate review to cite in this article
