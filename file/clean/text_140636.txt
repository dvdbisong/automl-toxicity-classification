Question American Planning Association
EurekaLott the American Planning Association page was my first attempt at wikipedia editing From what I understand you reverted it back to its original version because the information was copied from the website planningorg Isnt it possible to retain the substance of the added material while changing the language if the information is indeed accurate Also can the website give its permission to use copyrighted material Thanks for your help
