To this day the Sierra Club and its allies want to dynamite Hetch Hetchy and restore it to nature 76105223232  
they demand draining Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley which explosive is to be used they dont specify    

They dont demand anything What is specifically said is this
We urge Secretary of the Interior Donald P Hodel to undertake immediately a feasibility study leading to a recommendation for draining Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and restoring Hetch Hetchy Valley

and

We call upon all interests to take an openminded long view of this issue and to study and assess alternatives to meeting their needs and concerns through alternative sources of water power and revenue

But its kind of hard to frame that as them wanting to bomb the dam isnt it You also dont mention that debate  and studies  on the matter were still ongoing as of 2006 Frankly if thats the quality of your writing I can see why youre editing at Conservapedia 76105223232
