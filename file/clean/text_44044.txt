I am not a Sir Please keep your genderspecific terms to yourself I will assume you added this title as a courtesy so I will not be offended

McKinnon Broadcasting of Texas appears on some of their letterhead Pardon me for the mistake

Additionally you have added photos and weblinks that try to promote the station and yourself
I am not trying to promote anyone I have included links to pages where I had photos of the people about whom the articles were written If anything I was helping to add information about the person being discussed I have nothing to gain from adding or showing these photos Does Wikipedia have a posted definition of selfpromotion so that I can avoid doing it in the future

In deed it was my error to add things about a company which employees me I was unaware of this stipulation For that I apologize
