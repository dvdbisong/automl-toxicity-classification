Dutching
Because the overround at the bookies is so high one CANNOT effectively lay a horse by backing all the others  Usually this will result in an assured loss whatever nag wins  The obvious counterargument doesnt wash Im afraid  I am a frequent layer at Betfair so the dutching argument serves my interest but it cannot be practically implemented   0503 31 Mar 2005 UTC
