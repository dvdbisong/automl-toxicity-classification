I dont want to be judging other users especially since I was recently blocked and unblocked for a slight offense over 3RR but Ive found it incredibly difficult to collaborate with this user here when editing the 2008 South Ossetia article The users purpose on Wikipedia seems to be inserting a certain antiRussian POV and calling everything he disagrees with Russian propaganda in related articles disregarding some of the most fundamental procedures and edit warring blanking pages to remove things he doesnt want people to see gaming the system to push his POV and acting in an incredibly hostile fashion to any user who does not agree with him Again this is not an accusation or a judgment on the user but a personal opinion In conclusion the user has not been constructive at all so Im surprised the admins reduced his block for a repeated offense Nonetheless my best wishes to the user and I hope he refrains from making more unnecessary attacks in his edits and edit summaries
