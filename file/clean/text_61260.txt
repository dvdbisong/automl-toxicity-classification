If a controversial addition is made to an article and I dont think it belongs there based on wikipolicy Ill restore to the status quo and it can be discussed properly For an established article like John Howard there is usually no urgent need to include new material particularly if it relates to events years in the past Take a day or so find consensus everyone is happy I direct you to this edit by Docku where he proposes adding new material and it is discussed I also note WPEDIT saying All editors are encouraged to be bold but there are several things that a user can do to ensure that major edits are performed smoothly Before engaging in a major edit a user should consider discussing proposed changes on the article discussiontalk page There also used to be there may still be but I cant find it a guideline along the lines that you should try to write something that others will accept even if they dont agree with you Try to write for the other guy I dont think you or I are going to leave the project so we should try to get along with each other Im as sick of the John Howard article being a focus for conflict as you are
