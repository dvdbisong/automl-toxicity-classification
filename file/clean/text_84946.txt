PBY Catalina Survivors 

Shortly after creating the article with your guidance it was renamed and I failed to pursue the issue before some other edits were done Now I want to add appropriate categories I know some of those are changing but perhaps first the renaming should be reversed to fit with other similar articles before any images are added  Im happy to do it myself but need confidence that I wont screw it up having tried to understand the help pages on renaming but it looks like an ambiguous minefield MTIA
