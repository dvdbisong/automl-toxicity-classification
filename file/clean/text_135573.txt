I think that seems mostly reasonable  To the issue of links you had a point way the f up there about why wouldnt a link to modDB be appropriate  In the midst of all the other points and counterpoints I was juggling I kind of forgot it but your suggestion is reasonable  However in addition to a general mod link I think there should be links to one or two specific ones  Before you ask no mine wouldnt be one of those Zodiac TNM Reborn and HDTP are the candidates I had in mind
