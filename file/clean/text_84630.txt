Categorisation
Hi Hugo I see youve been doing a lot of recategorising recently I do wonder what the point of categories like Category1963 elections in Austria are when they only contain one article Personally I find categories like Category1963 elections in Europe useful as you can see several elections at once and taking articles out of them makes it more difficult to see whats there Ive started a discussion at Wikipedia talkCategorizationCreating categories for one article Cheers  57
