Reduce precision
I reduced the precision in the table but I wonder if we could reach a consensuos here on these infoboxes or should I revert The MoS says Avoid overprecise values where they are unlikely to be stable or accurate or where the precision is unnecessary in the context The speed of light in a vacuum is 299792458 metres per second is probably appropriate but The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 149014769 kilometres and The population of Cape Town is 2968790 would usually not be because both values are unstable at that level of precision and readers are unlikely to care in the context Im guessing that this was reached after the template was created and the template now conflicts with wiki polocy
