Service award
Hello I noticed you list yourself as a Senior Editor III which requires both 5 years of service and 33000 edits Xs counter however reports that you only have a little over 25000 edits In the grand scheme of things this isnt a big deal but since awards are one of the few means of positive reinforcement we have here on Wikipedia I feel it important we uphold their integrity Perhaps you were not aware that meeting both the tenure and edit count requirements are required to obtain these awards Or maybe you are counting edits from another account Whatever the case these awards are selfregulated so I just wanted to bring the issue to your attention Thanks for your continued service to the pedia  talk
