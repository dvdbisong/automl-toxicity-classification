Infobox cast listbilling 

Ive noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks mostly moving Patrick Dempsey andor Isaiah Washington higher in the list  Im guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and PDs McDreamy is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that PDEllen Pompeo and IWSandra Oh are the two big couples on the show but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of IW and PD at the bottom of the list someones idea of belittling their roles on the show  I doublechecked the order with the most recently aired episode and based on that I switched TR and Justin Chambers as well as JP Jr and Kate Walsh  The credits read with Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempseythat final billing with the preposition with is actually a good thing it reflects upon the actors value to the show  I just wanted to add this explanation here so that it could be referenced in case anyone was moved around in the order againmy edit places them in the correct order as billed
