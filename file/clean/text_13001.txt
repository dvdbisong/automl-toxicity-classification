Caminosoto you dont know what youre talking about Spaniards ARE NOT hispanic The label Hispanic although it originated in Spain is used to classify the peoples of Latin America NOT Spain And another correction to your error is that there is no such thing as a white hispanic A Spaniard is white not a white hispanic Hispanic does not include racial categories I get very tired of seeing these mistakes over and over again It seems that people are easily brainwashed into accepting anything americans classify
