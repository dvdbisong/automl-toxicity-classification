Hi
As I understand you just deleted a talk sequence here  I cannot find in WPTALK the point you are making Since I started the topic section Noam_Chomsky and I am focusing on my intro of the subject it is strange to me that the text is removed In content eg I showed that someone reverted even completed full 2nd cycle after I started the talk I also showed that the discussion eg edit motivations went astrange So why delete This way I am forced into a discussion I do not want I suggest you revert the text
