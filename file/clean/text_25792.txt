As to your question about my plans I think you are asking a hypothetical about something that has already been asked and answered  My plans are really more an expectation one already stated that my discussion with the closing admin becomes moot

As to your question about the purposes of restoring a Wikipedia edit history that sounds like something that could have its own WP page but I didnt see anything with a quick search  It is a part of WPATD and WPEditing policy where it is used with merger  A restored edit history means that the edits of content contributors are no longer listed as part of the deleted edits count and nonadmins can research the diffs  Attribution from the edit history is part of our licensing    

Scottywong At WPREFUND Amatulic has stated  this page is for requesting uncontroversial restorations only  Yet after five days heshe has not closed the WPREFUND request as controversial  It occurs to me there is another path forward which is a variation of my initial request  Please consider reverting your closing and instead relisting the AfD  Respectfully
