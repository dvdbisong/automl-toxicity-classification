Do you honestly believe that blocking my edits from this account means that I wont find a way to circumvent such flimsy controls Perhaps I shouldnt have stated that wikipedia has no controls whatsoever it certainly does those controls are a means to assert a point of view and purport to publish it under the guise of objectivity by censoring dissent through subversive means Your site is a joke and your belief that censoring people through the use of a skewed moderation mechanism is an effective means of preserving the pretense of objectivity is completely ignorant of the resourcefulness of a dedicated mind

Perhaps you should take a look at Roland Rance and the rest of his selfidentified Marxist cronies as they domineer their pet articles before you attack people for asserting a point of view Maybe then your misguided notions of putting people in their place would have some justifiable notions behind them But I think the more likely outcome is that youll continue preserving viewpoints you find agreeable under the pretense of a dedication to objectivity and education Carry on propagandizing regardless of my behaviour you will still have trash opinion articles on a site that aims to compete with reputed publications like Britannica At least there education is valued
