Reverted edit 

Hi I recently changed a passage that could be contested to reflect a more neutral stance and it was reverted Lets reach a compromise on this

The Cave of the Patriarchs is considered to be the spiritual center of the ancient city of Hebron in the Judean part of what is collectivelly known by the world as the West Bank It is called in Hebrew Mearat Hamachpelah מערת המכפלה The Cave of the double caves or tombs because according to Jewish tradition its hidden twin caves are considered to be the burial place of four pairs of important Biblical couples 1 Adam and Eve 2 Abraham and Sarah 3 Isaac and Rebekah 4 Jacob and Leah

The parts placed in square brackets are what I believe is proIsrael POV
