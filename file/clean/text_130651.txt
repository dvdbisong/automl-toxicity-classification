Cruft in trivia section
A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesnt belong It being a reunion of sorts and it being at WM doesnt make it any more notable at all The dance segment didnt affect any of the matches and certainly doesnt help the article  
I suggest moving to the notes section   316 
Its always been in the notes section thats not the problem here The problem is its a backstage segment Backstage segments arent notable and dont affect the matches or anything why add this one over others Just because it was a reunion isnt a good enough reason in my opinion People certainly could argue the Boogey ManTrump segment was notable as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction or just on the fact Trump appeared Its fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think its interesting Thats not enough to keep it on the article  
Oh I didnt see that Hmmm let me see what I can do with it   316 

I think that we should just add them to the other talent section if they arent there already and not mention the dance It was pretty pointless and doesnt seem necessary Peace  The rid 
While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasnt notable this segment had the return of Slick first time in like 15 years and a bunch of other WWE legends It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO especially the reunion part You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem so you wouldnt be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section what would we put down for them so someone else doesnt remove it It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event coevering the notability part Being cruft is an opinion being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning  

Eh the return of Slick is pretty important Ill change my vote to Weak Support as I had forgotten about that point Peace  The rid 
Covered in almost every review I find that very hard to believe Provide some proof Also so what if its covered The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well that doesnt mean we will start listing highlights for each match I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy meaning not everything should be determined by a vote I somehow think if this fancruft was gone no one would be readding except for TJ From the edit history it seems like he was the only one readding it back That certainly shows that people dont care about it A few talk page posts in favor of it isnt much consensus to keep it on the article  
 and  among others Other people have added it back I just get to it first usually  
Considering OWW is a fansite only the Slam link is reliable Anyone can write a review and mention it fansites arent a reliable source Ive seen no edit history of anyone else readding it back so Im still going to believe no one else has until I see otherwise If I need to bring an admin into this I will Because in my opinion its a content dispute between me and TJ as no one else seems to care much about ONE LITTLE crufty thing Slick returned for ONE appearance post it on the Slick article and leave it at that  
I could find more if I tried that was in a quick 1 minute search I could flip it and say only you think it should be removed I dont see the big deal Its not cruft its notable based on what counts as being notable an
