As both Barney The Purple Dinosaur and a close friend of one Daniel Rooke aka Prime Possum I believe that I am aware of the circumstances of this matter to a greater degree than anybody else I find the claims of Tntnnbltn quite rediculous why as  respected membembers of society would both prime possum and myself be lying on the before mentioned issue How can a text on Prime Poussum be biased excuse me if Im mistaken but Prime Possum is loved by all and sundry and aside from the paedophilia incedent and that night we had in Vagasremember the strippersPrime Possum has a completely clean record Further to your claims that people in metropoliton areas are unaware of Prime Possum a recent survey undertaken by Elmer Fudd has determined that 69 of people are aware of Prime Possum This can be read in a favourable light when compared to a survey undertaken by myself which declares 98 of people regard Tntnnbltn as a wanker How can you declare Daniel Rooke as not notable this is the same young man who has achieved many feats such as kissing yours truely and taking advantage of a mute with a bung eye
