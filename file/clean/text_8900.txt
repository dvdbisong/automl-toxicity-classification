I pretty much agree In fact I was just linking Kode9 because I saw the ref when reading the entry page and I know he has a page Kode9 and Dubstep are certainly both notable and the inspiration of Ballard is quite interesting but is probably a good subject for a magazine article not a Wikipedia one Certainly more POV than it should be I think many good articles are spoiled by vainglorious mentions of friends bands so I can see where you are coming from Wouldnt this suggest removing the whole para though If we are going to have the para referring to Kode9 surely it is right to link to his page
