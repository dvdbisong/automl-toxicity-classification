I would argue that my own view is not only objective but also suitable for the rules of Wikipedia If anyone wants to read about the hooligan incidents the suitable place is the hooliganism section where it is explained further with the incidents happened in the past I strongly insist that the pages of sports clubs are only for official information related to the clubs themselves I also remind you that Galatasaray was not punished by UEFA for that incident because neither the place nor the reason of the incident was related to Galatasarayunlike the Heysel disaster which took place inside the
stadium on the day of the match It was 100 a football related
matter For reasons already discussed the Leeds  Galatasaray murders
were a civil matter even though the victims and perpertrators were
both football fans Thats why it is not appropriate to include that article here since even the International football committee did not relate it with the club of Galatasaray
