Dazed and confused 

Commander Perhaps you can help me  I noticed that a template otherplaces2Hayward is being used in the Hayward California article The template generates a link to Hayward disambiguation that then gets redirected to Hayward because the article was moved  Is there a move afoot to take disambiguation out of article titles  If so the templates should be changed to reflect that  Or am I missing something  Thanks
