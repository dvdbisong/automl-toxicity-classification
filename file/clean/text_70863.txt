Kevin your systematic deletion and suppression of the multi level cosmology stinks of inquisition Either you are too limited to open up your mind to other nonstandard cosmologies which by the way explain the universe much better than the classic cosmologies or your behavior is motivated by extremist religious beliefs This is cosmology this is not religion you should go publish your beliefs in the section on religion and you should stop vandalizing Wikipedia It seems that you have nothing better to do than day and night look for any mention of the multilevel cosmology in Wikipedia and systematically deleting it Yes some time ago the entire article on multilevel cosmology was deleted but I think the deletion was premature and was the result of the unorthodox explanations of the theory So even though the full article has been deleted there is no reason in the interest of science not to mention the multilevel cosmology in other sections and let others decide whether or not it is valid Censorship inquisition and suppression of science is counterproductive and harms science If you are so obsessed with censorship of Wikipedia do you also censor the articles in Tampa Tribune Is your motivation religious Kevin please stop your personal obsession with deletion and suppression of the multi level cosmology and do something more productive
