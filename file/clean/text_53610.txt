Equal Treatment for Transnistria 

We all agree that the Transnistria page is a difficult one to edit because there are strong views on both sides The current page is a work of twisted words and opinions and is not acceptable to any fairminded person  I have a proposal to normalise things here Forgive me but it is a Moldovan solution  Take a look at the Moldova main space and you will see an interesting list of headings for the topics in keeping with the way most otherr states are dealt with Then take a look at the headings for the Transnistrian page and youll see a marked difference I suggest that the editors work under an agreement of equality and respect Under this agreement headings are by dual agreement using Moldova as a template For example the Intro appears on both pages and should stay as should  Names Geography History Politics International relations Economics Human rights Demograpghics Economy  Information technology Culture Gallery External links  Headings that are parachuted onto the Transnistrian page that are under dispute be removed This includes all the Smuggling Crime and Travel Warnings That is assuming the Moldova page would prefer not to have such heading on that page Under this each side is treated with equal rights Attacks on the pages cease and a degree of harmony may prevail Can I have your feedback please
