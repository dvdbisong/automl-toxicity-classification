Since it appears that you have escalated your case to ArbCom there is really no point in echoing your arguments on your talk page in this way  You should offer any further information directly and exclusively to ArbCom via email  If they decide to believe you and reinstate your account you can share the news here with the rest of us at that time

Also previously I offered you some very concrete suggestions for establishing who you are as opposed to making claims of who you are not  If you are not in fact Justice Forever and are serious about wanting to convince ArbCom of this fact I would strongly recommend you follow those suggestions ASAP  Your latest piece of new evidence is really about the same as trying to clear your name via a checkuser request  something which as you should already understand is almost never accepted as a way of disproving sockpuppet allegations and which in fact is more often taken as evidence that you are a sock trying to blow smoke in peoples faces  Unless you present your most convincing information to ArbCom right now you are likely to find them unwilling to listen to anything further you might have to say regardless of its merits

Im going to stop watching your talk page at this point  If you are a sock of Justice Forever youre wasting my time  and if you are not Justice Forever I may be wasting your time by making you feel there is a reason to continue arguing your case here and in this particular way rather than talking only to ArbCom and trying to make the kind of case with them that has a chance though I dont know how much of a chance of actually working  Further posting of your arguments here on your talk page is very likely to make some admin decide to block you from being able to edit your talk page and also to semiprotect your talk page to keep you from editing via IP addresses without logging in first

Good luck or good riddance depending on who you really are   talk  contribs
