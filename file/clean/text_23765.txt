I think any discussion regarding Hulk and its relation to The Incredible Hulk and the MCU should be done on THOSE pages for the Hulk films and not here The MCU page is to discuss the films that are indeed a part of that continuity and how they connect and interact with crossover characters ideas plots and so on If someone wants to put a blurb about Hulk they could but I think any notes one might make here about its relation to The Incredible Hulk can be done on either of those two Hulk pages
