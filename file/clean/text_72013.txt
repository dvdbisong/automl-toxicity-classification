 Dancerock redirection 

I change the dancerock redirection from dance music to  PostdiscoDanceRock  From actualpointofview  DanceRock can not have its own article because of its sources DanceRocks only source is All Music Guide so there can be a WPV problem Anyway Google finds nothing only just irrelevant pages except yes AMG and Lastfm However some remarking have page of Billboard magazine from 2004

I also created DanceRock redirect   

AllMusic source
This article is one of a number of music genre articles that were created solely using AllMusic as a source and for which few other sources seemed to be available Id rather have just deleted it but decided instead to trim and rephrase it so that it was perfectly clear that elevating the term postdisco to genre status was apparently an attempt to fill a gap in AllMusics taxonomy of genres and that it was the creation of a nowuncredited individual author who was paid to write it Also I wanted to show the author never really defined it as a musical style it wasnt ever established how it was related to disco on one end and house music on the other

Recently the article has been expanded to cite other mentions of postdisco Im fine with that but Im not convinced every use of the term was really intended to be interpreted as a genre name Im just afraid this article is doing the exact same thing the AllMusic blurb did trying too hard to give traction to a name for something that really didnt have a name or that perhaps was only called boogie I feel like Id rather see a section of the Boogie article devoted to the dance music genre than to continue down the road of searching for vague references to dance music in the postdisco era as evidence of an accepted genre name   
My opinion is that postdisco is also genre boogie but also a movement but thats WPPOV I dont know I mean I dont understand whats really postdisco after disco era  boogie genre  means at all If it is era so all tracks to present is postdisco but if it is a genre unsourced only AMG and some kind of sites like  danceclassicsnet etc   

 OR  source misrepresentation in lead analysis 

None of the cited sources other than Allmusic suggest that postdisco is a genre Many of the citations are also WPSPS

The term postdisco or simply boogie has multiple meanings Citation does not support the assertion that postdisco has multiple meanings or that it is a term interchangeable with Boogie

Sometime after 1990AMG was founded in 1991   an Allmusic editorial contributor used postdisco in an attempt to isolate a dance music genre in the era between the indistinct end of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music Proposition unsupported by a third party verifiable source this is editorial analysis therefore WPOR

Postdisco was used in 1984 by Cadence Magazine when defining postdisco soul as
