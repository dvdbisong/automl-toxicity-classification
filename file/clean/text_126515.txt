WorldInferno HAS NOT broken up 

The information added to the page is not correct and I am being barred from correcting it This band HAS NOT broken up Rumors of the bands breakup sprang from a joke started this past weekend that other people have started to believe is actually true The band has not announced a breakup and there is no proof or sources cited anywhere that the band has broken up Everytime I edit the page so that it correctly reflects the bands status my edits are reverted and marked as vandalism

Once again rumors of WorldInfernos breakup are greatly exagerated
