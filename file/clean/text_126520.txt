declineI am declining your request for unblock because it does not address the reason for your block or because it is inadequate for other reasons To be unblocked you must convince the reviewing administrators that 
the block is not necessary to prevent damage or disruption to Wikipedia or
the block is no longer necessary because you
understand what you have been blocked for
will not continue to cause damage or disruption and
will make useful contributions instead
