I disagree with your definition of innapropriate You arent familiar with the situation at hand and to clarify Im gonna explain it to you See my friend often acts in a very odd manner kind of like an animal So I decided to create a false species mimicking her actions thus inventing the ilanius goblinius Obviously its all nonesense thats what makes it so stupdily funny Shes very sick right now and when I made this for her in august her health improved drastically Laughter is the best medecine after all One day she was looking for it and told me it wasnt on here anymore so I looked for it only to see that it had been deleted I appologize for being rude or hostile it was only because it was the only thing Ive seen my friend be really happy about in a long time I would very much appreciate it if you PLEASE gave it back to me Its the only thing that will cheer her up Ive tried everything This is her last wish of me she said Please somehow get the article back Dont be rude to the person who took it off after all they were jsut following the rules of their job I wanna read it one more time and when I get better Ill write one for you too I cant even being to appologize for my rudeness or aggrevating behaviour Please dont let our differences in the idea of the ideal birthday present be the reason for my friends sorrow She did nothing if anyone is guilty here its probably me Im sorry dragonfly67  please reconsder
