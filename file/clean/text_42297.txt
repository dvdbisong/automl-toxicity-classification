Some possible illustrations
I have now at long last added an illustration to your article on Andreas Hallander as you once asked me to do Unfortunately the most destinctive feature of the building the pilasters is not very visible in the picture though You can find info on the building here here  and here This vintage photo shows the building together with the previous Christiansborg Palace which it was apparantly designed to fit so maybe that was another possibility in terms of illustrations for the article

I have also uploaded some pictures relating to Møn which may be relevant illustrations for some of your articles Here is an Eckersberg painting from Liselund gardens and here is Westerholdts original garden plan from 1791 Here is a Christian Dahl painting with Klintekorset in it from Møns KlintLiselund and here is a pastoral scene by Eckersberg from somewhere on Møn I dont know if any of them are of relevance to you but just wanted to let you know that they are there
