Films

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template including genre art direction casting second unit director costume design for example Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilmsWesterns to conentrate on improving western film articles I know a number of members who would be interested 

Youll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  TemplateFilmrationale  for screenshots and posters  and TemplateFilmbiorationale for all deceased film people I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO much easier It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them For normal bios use TemplateBiorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960present is really needed 

Hope you are well and await your response   Expecting you Contribs
