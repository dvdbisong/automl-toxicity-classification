Blof theres a user  who back in time kept removing the words Muslim and Islam from actor articles such as Shahrukh Khan Aamir Khan Saif Ali Khan He just kept deleting the fact that theyre Muslim A few days back he removed a great deal of info from Saif Ali Khans article I restored it now with sources but he keeps removing substantial info such as the fact that his mother had converted to Islam and a quote of his in which he says that religion is very important to him
There was a claim on the Aishwarya Rai article in which she accuses Salmans Khan for hitting and abusing her The user removed the claim that Khan denied this I cited a TOI source in which Khan clearly denies this and the guy keeps trying to reword it to show Salman Khan in a bad light
I warned the user but he keeps at the same Could you please talk to him   Talk2me
