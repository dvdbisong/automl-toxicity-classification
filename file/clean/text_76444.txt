I suggest you open an SPI against VanishedUser314159 The evidence itself is quite convincing An alternative is to notify Jpgordon since he is the admin who did the indefinite block of VU314159 which is still in effect  My logged blocks of the previous IPs are in WikipediaARBPSLog of blocks and bans   1531
