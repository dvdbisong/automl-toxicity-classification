This kind of behaviour is nonconstructive  I clearly wrote my reasons in the talk page Now I will restore my edit I strongly suggest use the talk page to let me know your reasons on the contrary my only chance will be to contact an admin to report your behaviour  
See your talk page   
You refused to discuss in talk page so that Ive reported you Im going to resore my edits I invite you to be more collaborative and to discuss in the proper talk page  

See my talk page as well I do agree you should be discussing this on the article talk page if only to get the protection lifted although I think you realise that this is someone who is trying even though not completely successfully to work within what he sees as the rules
