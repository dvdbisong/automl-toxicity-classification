Im a little confused  There can only be one page for an article on Wikipedia  The title will be probably which one came first The US are always changing titles who knows why so its always a problem  same as Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone film UK and most of the world or Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone film US and India  Its one of the things we have to live with SO any alternative title is just a simple redirect to the main article  theres no way to have the same article with different headings  just a hatnote at the top or a note in the lead paragraph Â Talk
