Q I know you ran a marathon in Houston in 1993 What are your recollections from that
AI  was distraught after my dad was defeated in 1992 so I decided I was going to set a little project for myself I wanted to run the White Rock Marathon in Dallas so I began training intensely for it I gave myself a month to train for it and pushed myself incredibly hard as this afterelection therapy But I got sick and it was really a foolish attempt on my part
QIt takes a lot longer than a month to get ready for a marathon
ADr Ken Cooper of the Cooper Clinic told me the same thing So I set my sights on Houston which gave me some more time to train I ran it in 344 I ran the first mile in 8 _ minutes and the last mile in 8 _ minutes It was one of the great experiences of my life
