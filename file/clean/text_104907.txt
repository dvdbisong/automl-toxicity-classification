I dont care about a color scheme for the cast I just felt that it might have needed a separation between the films and the first cast member and I didnt particularly think the black would suit it Yeah Ill try and see if I can find an image that links all three films something official otherwise I say use the first film poster As for identifying the films in the plot sectionYou could just link the titles of the films or use a semicolon before each title Not sure about that   Contact me 0124
