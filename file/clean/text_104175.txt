Everything I had to say about this I said last July not only about the content including the Saturday Evening Post but about your ruminations on my character and motives If you have problem with those gather your evidence and take it to the appropriate forum otherwise knock it off My arm is back in a castsplit thingy and I dont want to type the same stuff all over again

Just out of curiosity setting aside for now what the sources say are due decided to publish in their reports do YOU believe that the facts that 1 The ad used to order the weapon used to assassinate a sitting president was in NRA publication American Rifleman and that 2 The NRA had a lot to say about this law is simply coincidental If you had been editor of these sources at the time would you have left out that the ad came from American Rifleman  that was inconsequential
