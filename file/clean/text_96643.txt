HIV transmission does NOT have a constant level of risk per exposure  Some people are genetically resistant eg CCR5_Î”32CCR5CE9432 as potential recipients and some people are likely not to be very infectious even if infected eg HLA B57  In addition acutely infected people are the most infectious and people with genital ulcer disease are likely to be both high transmitters and particularly susceptible  So the risk depends dramatically on many variables  In addition its known that the cumulative risk approaches only about 40 in discordant couples and the uninfected partners tend to show evidence of cellular immunity to HIV suggesting exposure
