Hungry
 Heres a nightshot of the city from the northeast probably your best approach to minimize a possible counterstrike from the nearby Air Force Base even though all they have there is non combat aircraft Ive been looking for a reason to leave here and I figure that if the city is devoured by hungry Bishzilla I might feel inspired to do so I live well west of downtown and am sure Ill hear the air raid sirens in time to scamper me scampering out of your path of destruction Thanks in advance 

Scampering MONGO is little scamp  ROARR 

 Pets not snacks 

 Pets not snacksHello Zilla I just want to explain why I originally didnt want to give any cute little grass mice to Bishonen I had read here and here about people buying rodents to feed them to their pet reptiles so I feared for the safety of the cute little stripey mice However having read this I now see that in fact Bishonen is the one I should worry about and not you So here are two cute little Barbary Striped Grass Mice for you  a slightly different species from the Typical Striped Grass Mouse But please do keep them safe from that horrible user Bishonen  talk 
Little Elinor got Bishonens number plenty right She scaree with her goulashes and midEuropean meat stews She put several small editors in there when nobody looking Appreciate cute stripey pets Zilla personally never eat anything smaller than s Not worth trouble  ROARR 

Careful zillaeating s could lead to some very acute indigestion  Tropics 

JUST A THOUGHT

Great Zilla please stop Bishonen from putting editors in goulash Goulash is a beef stew Editors go in bogr√°cs Also please accept this pretty box as a token of my desire not to be eaten Zocky   
Hmm  go in goulash  ROARR 
Ah the goodness of gouhuahuash Zocky   
Puppy goulash NOT good Live puppies much better block vandals make nice edits  

 Big time award all should be envious 
 Its a cow with a star on itAlthough you have yet to complain at the  Ive nevertheless decided to award you the awesome MONGO gave me a cow Barnstar I thought some beef would be better eating than concrete and the stray fighter jet
