There is no free speech on Wikipedia
You are nuts there is a lot of freedom of speech in the US and you abide to that
You cant just make a law that will prevail over the US constitution Unless you are willing to rewrite the bill of rights for that we have to kill Dr MLK jr again
You allowed this computer hacker Pablo something located overseas probably in some garage in a little town in a country called argentina to ignore laugh at our bill of rights
He censored my contributions probably he could not even understand what was in those his command of the language is just poor you allowed him to show how powerful he is
No freedom of speech on wikipedia and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement
This pablo does not need to worry about the us constitution the bill of rights or anything like that probably he does not even care about the bill of rights of his own country
He can do as he pleases and block the freedom of speech of any US citizen at will
His intrusion in our territory shall not be tolerated he can do as he pleases in his country but in ours he just cant
I strongly recommend in order to preserve the little prestige left for wikipedia you dont allow this overseas people what you allow them to do
I see now why he thought the law was a threat probably it is back there here is some precious possession of ours that did cost blood and we shall defend it
I emailed the Attorney General but i doubt this pablo even knows where california is
Now that i know his whereabouts i think his connections with carrio are closer than what i thought
I am writing these reviews on behalf of a friend located in argentina she told me she was too scared to do that from there and requested my help  I thought she was making that up but now i believe her and i shall continue to protect her from these pablofriends
God Bless America     
Thanks Martin Luther King Jr you are still among us
