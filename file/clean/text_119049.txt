Anonymous targeting Lt John Pike of the UC Davis Police Department 

While reviewing news reports for the Occupy UC Davis article I stumbled upon various reports that Anonymous is now targeting Lt John Pike of the UC Davis Police Department and that it had released a YouTube video to that effect  By the time I got to YouTube the video had been removed as being a violation of YouTubes policy against hatespeech    httprtcomusanewsanonymousprotestersspraypike089
