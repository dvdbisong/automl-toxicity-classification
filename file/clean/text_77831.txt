I reverted the changes to the list because they seemed to be pruning out the genuinely notable films while leaving many that arent Ive heard of almost all of the films that were removed but only a few that were kept I prematurely assumed somewhat poor faith and reverted the change I think that we should discuss which films should be kept Certainly Star Wars is notable I think that such removals should be considered more carefully Is there any particular reason why the current list was kept
