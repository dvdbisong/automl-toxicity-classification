Dear PinchasC 

Thank you for your input  However there are many reputable and notable sources attesting to the existence of numerous extremist messianists  also boreinuniks and elokists  Berger and others discuss them at length as do the two notable sources one from Haaretz no less which you removed

I think it is fair to mention these strands in the article and certainly reasonable to do so in the light of the numerous sources  Certainly the sources should also be kept  This is all in line with wiki policy as far as I can make out

The Lubavitcher Rebbe as a god Saul Sadka Haaretz
A Brief History of Lubavitch Messianism Melech Jaffe

I do agree that Yechi should be merged into this article and not the other way round  I notices the Yechi article and thought it quite absurd that there was a Yechi article but no Mishichist article  So I thought to rectify that

Thank you again for helping out
