Telos 

I have added Telos to the home planet section of the infobox mentioning that it was adopted several times now and each it has been removed by the cryon userEdoktor Telos ought definitely to be included there as is is a massive part of who history two episodes being set on telos itself and based around the cybermens exploits there and at least 6 episodes featuring telosian Cybermen the Cybermen in general featured in 10 so it was more than half Many Cybermen were created there there was a large cyberconversion facility thus most Cybermen after the tenth planet destroyed most of them originated there and that is where the cyber controller rules from there Thus it is definitely a cyberhome planet and I see no possible justification for not including it on the section of the infobox I did reference the second time so this cannot have been the issue

Thanks for your time
