Thanks for the swift and thoughtful reply  Everything in the first part makes sense and to the second part I really like option 1  The Gregorian calendar is the predominant calendar in international trade and communication is succinct in your correct analysis of leaving out a trace of religion to avoid conflict  It lacks any POV of preference in personal life and religion it is a fact rather than truth  Ill take it but wait a bit to see if or when others chime in  Two makes consensus naught  Ill check back in a day or two to see what has developed  Happy editing to you  talk
