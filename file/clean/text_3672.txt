MediaWikiDuplicatedefaultsort 

Do you realize what a wonderful thing this is  When you created it eight weeks ago was it your intention to address the conflict that pupped up in the category it created  I hope not because I have been although if you want to jump in and take care of the ones under S and T while I finish L and do M through R I will not complain

When I stumbled across the category there were 2777 pages in it  By the end of today there will be fewer than 1000  My goal is to get all the nontrivial items resolved by the end of next week so I can start on the pages in CategoryBiography articles without listas parameter a project that should keep me out of trouble for the rest of my life  

Because I am resolving the conflicts in the first category I have learned more about how banners work than probably anyone else except the folks like you who know why the banners work as they do  I have also leaned what items can set the DEFAULTSORT As an added bonus I have leaned a couple of keyboard shortcuts I did not know before and I have become almost addicted to Preview

The absolutely best part about the DupDS is that the category it has created that I will continue to monitor on a daily basis is a safety net for me when I mess something up on a page in  CategoryBiography articles without listas parameter  The easiest error to make is for me to neglect to put a listas value in a template that uses it wants it and will throw a fit if it is not there

Thank you
