Ive changed the word races to factions in the description of the first season of Transformers  In TFTM the narrator refers to ALL Transformers when he calls them a unique race of transforming robots  I think it is more accurate to refer to Autobots and Decepticons as subgroups akin political groups or even nationalities within the Transformer race
