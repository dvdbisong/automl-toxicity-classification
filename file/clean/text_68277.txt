Intransitive Strategies 

It seems that this page needs to mention the case when strategies are intransitive  In the number game for example a comparison of 0 vs 4 would give an additional equilibrium of 44 but choosing 34 32 21 and 10  This situation seems to apply to several cases such as the Travelers Dilemma and Centipede game where the Nash equilibrium is not the result of play and not the best strategy  I dont know of any references and am not educated in game theory but explicitly addressing this could make these cases where the Nash equilibrium is not chosen much less confusing
