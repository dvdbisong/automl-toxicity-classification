So what if Konqueror and other file managers can be made to behave like dualpane file managers Thats not their normal read preset mode of operation thats why they probably shouldnt fall into that category Dualpane behaviour is part of Konquerors functionality not its whole functionality You can play textmode Tetris from within Emacs Would you categorize Emacs as a Tetris clone
As for your conveniently abridged definition of orthodox dualpane file managers are not traditional in any possible meaning of the word if theres any tradition in file management thats either the shell or spatial file management Ã  la classic Macintosh Finder They certainly arent customary nowadays nor are they more generally accepted than other approaches So it actually sounds like youre making my point for me there Besides the etymological read original definition of orthodox is having the right opinion which of course is crazy when applied to any kind of software But again youre missing the point as Ive already told you the only criteria to keep into consideration is USAGE OF THE TERM in qualified circles
