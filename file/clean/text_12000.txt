That is not a list of official names of official neighborhoods their is no such list that exists that is a of neighborhood names of which more then half are no longer used that
are taken from  Philadelphia Almanac and Citizens Manual which was edited by Kenneth Finkel and published by the Library Company of Philadelphia in 1994 and 1995 It has been augmented by the staff of the Philadelphia City Archives

The 1994 edition of this book contained 389 different names of various neighborhoods throughout the city of Philadelphia from the earliest days of Swedish occupation to the present The following year an additional six names were added to bring the list to 395 This list is being augmented yet again by the Philadelphia City Archives with names of neighborhoods redevelopment areas and other place names which have been assigned officially or unofficially to certain areas of the city It is interesting to see the dynamics of neighborhood naming in over 350 years of occupation of the 129 square miles which comprise Philadelphia by the Native Americans the Swedes the English and German pioneers and later and current Philadelphians
