There is no policy basis for the block  Your idea that engaging in a discussion in an article talk page with only two comments no less in a way that involves policy constitutes a policy discussion is just preposterous  Posting the murderers name on the talk page does not constitute disruption yes making a point but no not disrupting Wikipedia and in any case theyve promised not to continue  And given that you have been involved in the discussion and taken a clear stance against this users opinions as established by you here it might be best for you to let it be  I honestly see at most 2 who really support the block you and Jayron and youd been involved in the dispute  Arguably Exploding Boy might have but his one comment has  been contradicted  Roux Hersfold and Baseball Bugs never said anything about the block and Roux is highly involved anyway  Enigma supported a checkuser but gave no reasoning at all  Plus weve gotten concessions from the user  juicetalk
