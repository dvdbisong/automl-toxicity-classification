Mass Deletions and synopsis 

At this point I think it is important to discuss what constitutes excessive detail when it comes to a multiissue crossover event Given that the storyline covers months of details and multiple points of view each seperate series we should come to a consensus on what should be included in the article and what should be left to the imagination or primary sources There also seems to be an effort on the parts of some editors to delete material without consensus so this is an attempt to find that consensus Please chime in on your views of the organization structure and content of the article
