Howdy Malleus Fatuorum I saw the kerfuffle at ANI and I would like to clarify something for myself When you said The truth about whats going here has surely been evident for some time now This article is designed to be a memorial not a neutral account of the events of 911 and their aftermath which is why it will never be better than it is It may well be satisfactory to American rednecks in its present state but it most definitely is not to anyone not draped in red white and blue at the TalkSeptember 11 attacks page was it your intention to label the actual editors of the page as rednecks For me thats how I personally interpret that comment given the use of the terms here designed and may well be If that wasnt your intention Id be interested to hear what your intention was given your strident defence of it above If you can see your way to replying that would be grand and I might have follow up queries of a similar nature In peace Malik P
