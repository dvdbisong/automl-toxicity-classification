DYK for job attitude 

DYK for job attitude
Greetings
I was wondering if you can look over the nomination for Job attitude  This nomination was pending before the request for other articles So I was wondering if you can glance it All of the other admins in the page are OK with the article They cant recommend it because they fixed stuff to it All of the errors are fixed and there is no copyediting at all The request for this article has already been posted on the WTDYK however people are not taking action My class is ending for the APS project and this being in the DYK can really help out alot of things on my campus
