Neil please note that your thread reads

Oh I see  Group consensus was that the information pertaining to Robin Hood was too long and so I have halved it  To that end both Staszek Lem and Yngvadottir have acknowledged that it is difficult to condense the subject of Robin Hood to four or five sentences  Obviously there is a slit consensus of opinion here and so I ask that you please either let the article stand or use your experience to edit it  

By the way have you had a chance to watch the video that I posted yet
