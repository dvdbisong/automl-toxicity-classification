Wikipedia riddled with errors is misinforming people and is blamed for falling grades among children

See this article 

I concur and will contribute nothing further to this disinformative farce parading as an encyclopaedia that is called wikipedia It is nothing more than a joke run forby incompetent nonexperts with too much time on their hands and nothing better to do than stroke each others egos while fostering mediocrity and ignorance under the specious banner of consensus and democracy 

Yes I am uncivil towards those for whom this is intented but they deserve it for raising inaccuracy and misinformation to a virtue I will not suffer fools any further
