HelpAdvice in creation of an article
Hello Sir I wanted to create a page on Mr Ziauddin Yousafzai father of Malala Yousafzai But am unable to create a page on Ziauddin Yousafzai as now it is a redirect Could you kindly remove the redirect so as to enable to create an article about him 

Ok the reason for the need of creation of an article on him is that now he has been appointed as United nations Special advisorenvoy on Global Education  httpwwwlivemintcomPolitics7AmAud6bJ1of9J1fnfNfPNMalalasfathernamedUNadvisoroneducationhtml and also Pakistans education attache in Birmingham httpwwwhindustantimescomworldnewsEuropeDiplomaticroleforMalalasdadArticle1984617aspx So IMHO this makes him very much notable figure and as he has been nominated for the post of UN envoy a page on him is feasible and needed 

Kindly advice Thanks Meanwhile wish you all a very happy New Year 2013 With best regards
