Hi
Doesnt look like anyone has been maintaining this recently Ive updated the page and cleaned it up a bit there were some dodgy links I think Ive done it right I put in a link to the International Journal of Play even though its not in the wikipedia yet I hope that was the right thing to do I checked the links that were there and it all seems to check out so I dont think this is autobiography but I might have misunderstood that Anyway hopefully this is an improvement YoungPhoenix 21212121045
