Conclusions
Having read all of the above it is obvious that both capitalizatons are acceptable depending on the style choice and the context While Fishheads proposal Liturgy of the Hours Catholic Church is appreciated IMO it adds an unnecessary level of complication for sake political correctness I have a fixedwing aircraft in mind and violates Titles should be as simple as possible without being too general clause of WPNCCN This article is rightly or wrongly currently focused to the Catholic service and its current form At the risk of being frivolous I must say that I consider most of the discussion above as Wikipedia hairsplitting of the month Editors are kindly invited to amend the article with few sentences regarding the approaches to capitalization 

Is it Murphys law that I come to close RM discussions involving Espoo or just a result of law of large numbers I admit I wanted to walk away from this closing but it would result in waste spending of another admins time In any case Im switching back into busy in real life mode so please direct any further continuation if called for here rather than on my talk page
