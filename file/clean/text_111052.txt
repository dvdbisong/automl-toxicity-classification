I certainly do not have a problem with this user CORRECTING birth date years to reflect the truth provided some kind of proof is given in the form of a link to an authoritative web site or other source  The evidence indicates however that the changes made by this user were in fact arbitrary additions or subtractions of a year or two or ten  It may be that the user inadvertently hit on a correct year purely by accidental coincidence particularly if there are source information sites that have alternate years of birth posted as well  But there are other cases in the contributions list where the user made a change to a false year and then changed it back to the correct year either to confuse the antivandalism patrollers or to make the latest edit look like a true and legitimate one  Either way I think it would be good practice for us all to provide a reference link and edit summary any time such a change is made  In the case of celebrities with two or more possible birth years then we should post all of them with an explanation and again reference sources for proof  Thanks   1841
