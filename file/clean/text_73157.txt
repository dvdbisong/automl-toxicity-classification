I have reinstated the fugitive part because the first sentence is usually a justification of notability be it fame or notoriety and not just a declaration of the subjects occupation at the moment a Google search for Eli Soriano fugitive returns 1590 hits In view of notability international fugitive is more pressing than controversial Filipino televangelist and so it took precedence It would be anticlimatic to reverse their positions Nevertheless I am for the improvement of the article and have nothing against restructuring the first paragraph to make it more encyclopedic Perhaps we can learn something from the Warren Jeffs article as it is excellently written Eli Soriano may also be fitting for WPCRIME
