I have removed the Newcomb quote  it makes absolutely no sense to me I know what GRAS is and I know exactly how ingredients are listed and declared and it is like talking in circles Well duh you dont have to list the composition of beef for example An ingredients label is just that  ingredients  not a chemical analysis of every last molecule of the product If it was an exact chemical analysis of the product only the very largest companies could ever afford to put a product on the market You do realize COOKING creates free glutamate in nearly any product that contains protein Specially glutamaic acid

I have also removed the precautions section It contains statements that I believe are unsubstantiated Addictive How so Cite the mechanism Psychologically addictive Physically addictive Furthermore even if accurate it is written using verbiage that tends to be fearmongering
