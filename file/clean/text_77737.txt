Wrong decision 

You have atlast removed the picture ShaikhChandScanjpg for some silly reasons I guess a responsible administrator should first get to the roots and then take a decision It was a harsh and hasty decision When no one from WikipediaIndia objects to the image who are you to object and remove the picture Kindly restore it or let the administrators from WikipediaIndia decide about the fate of the picture Cheers
