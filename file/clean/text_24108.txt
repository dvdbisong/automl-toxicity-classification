you have outright lied in edit history   What I actually said was Gwillhickers Stop making unilateral edits to remove Hemings from the Lead  you have no concensus  this is well sourced its a notable controversy WPLEAD guidelines  I didnt say you removed her name per se but that you removed the full sentences on Hemings I assumed you made the edit to  the lead last week since you were going on and on about it and made plenty of edits to the article If it wasnt you who made the edit then you have my apology Im not however apologising for restoring the information by making the edit itself Thats a far cry from a lie its an honest error in naming the person responsible Do be reasonable man
