2000 Census data
Originally I was removing the 2000 data but then I was informed by an admin that wasnt what the consensus was and after looking at it now I kind of agree it does make the pages look a little bit better having both write ups in the Demographics sections Somewhere there has been a discussion about this and they prefer that the data from 2000 is put into a subsection and left there I personally dont know where this discussion took place and if youd like to inquire further about it Id recommend talking to   he is the person who informed me I wasnt following the consensus
