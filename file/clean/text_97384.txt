Warning about Censorship
Most of the links I added to Yechi article httpenwikipediaorgwikiYechiexcept one were not to my sites and truth is my sites are not commercial sites and the link to one of my pages contained valueble info related to the subject but since you insist I replaced it to the link to that same video on 770livecom without my comments under it I hope this will make you very happy that I have observed every detail of Wiki rules Now go make a Didan Notzach farbrengen with your friends about this amazing development
PS By the way your intention to simply enforce Wiki rules was once again proven when you didnt simply remove that one link you had problem with but reversed the whole article with all the added info and gave this as an excuse
May the RebbeAlmighty send refua shleima to all of his Chassidim who wish to protect Him from the spread of his holy teachings
