1st Hayes stamp
I formattedcentered the caption text to the Hayes stamp adding note that stamp was issued on the 100th aniv of Hayes birth Some html is ok if used sparingly  Presently the placement of the stamp seems a bit odd Noting that the Rutherford page doesnt have much of a closing perhaps a legacy section which includes the stamp image and other images with words that bring Rutherfords legacybiography to a close might be a consideration
