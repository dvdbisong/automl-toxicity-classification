Whatever was claimed on the show has to be mentioned in the article under the Conspiracy Theories section It is another conspiracy theory and although whoever removed my edit probably doesnt like that theory its yet another theory presented in a TV show that was produced by a former governor a show with high viewing ratings highest ever in TruTV Even if the claims of the episode are totally flase thats what the show claimed within the scope of a conspiracy theory and therefore my paragraph should be resored in that section
