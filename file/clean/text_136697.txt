Your edits on Rani Mukerji

Please stop readding your edits diff without proper discussion on the talk page of the Rani Mukherjee article What problem do you have for the article to be copied into a another language Wikipedia has no problems with it and your trivia edit is nonnotable Rani has probably acted with every Bollywood star there currently is and there is no need to list them all in the trivia section Please discuss your edits on the talk page and explain why you think your edits are a helpful contribution to the article I have reverted it back to the previous version for now
