Now that is just rude You are mixing up issues and people Some of the later edits have been silly but only after KO took over the sites repeatedly violating the 3RR rule like he owned Wiki and with him alone deciding what was vandalism and adding not one thing to any site and urging people to be banned and sites frozen with almost no content It is not his decision alone on what things are proper edits on these things Wiki works on consensus not individual experts or those posing as experts
