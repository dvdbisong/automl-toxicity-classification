Well a great start is the newsletter link itself that sent you Ill add what information I can glean from it to the article Yes a blog or website of Franzs would be a terrific additional resource which we can use subject to the guidelines on selfpublished sources If Franz were to be interviewed by someone like Bryan Stroud or Jim Amash for TwoMorrows Publishings Alter Ego or Back Issue for example that would be even better Im sure both of these comics historians among others would welcome the opportunity to speak with him
