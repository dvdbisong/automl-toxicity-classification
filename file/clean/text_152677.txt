NPOV 

I reverted your edits at Continental Freemasonry because the tone was very POV trying to show that somehow the liberal tradition is right and frankly rude AngloAmerican tradition insists The use of God in Masonic politics has a long history and so on and so forth  The sources you cite do not support the inflammatory editorializing you have added  Furthermore Wikipedia is neither a soapbox nor a battleground  State the facts and only the facts  If you cannot do so please refrain from editing the article
