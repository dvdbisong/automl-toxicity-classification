Japan

Hi Id tried to rewrite a section relate to Japan but my English is quite limited So could someone help to rewrite an article

My suggestion is about Japanese streetname of the drug Shabu is a street name which is used by Yakuza that name was not popular before ban of the drug Before methamphetamine ban Philopon ヒロポン was the most popular name Philopon is a trademark of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma httpwwwdspharmacojp former Dainippon Pharma 大日本製薬 And there are ads of Philopon which was sold over the counter httpwwwwarbirdsjpheiki42000htm

Methamphetamine is the still number one illigal hard drug in Japan Most common street name is speed or S and usually used by smoking Methamphetamine regulation is very strict and difficult to use for medical purpose ADHD is treated with methylphenidate
