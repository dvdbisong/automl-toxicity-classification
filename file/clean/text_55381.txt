i am sorry to have involved you in this issue of Qutbi Bohra article Firstly i would just like to tell you as you already know that i am new here and i am not aware of the fine points of Wikipedia 

Secondly Ftutocdg has called Sam and Dharam as can be seen from their talk pages To help him out delete Qutbi Bohra page They have no interest in the content or anything else of the article Since Sam Is talking of my edits i am just trying to save the article Just see the way they have vandalised the article I know you have less knowledge regarding the article but you atleast would know that Quran exists Prophet Muhammed exist It is such common and well known points that has been deleted under beliefs section religion etc stating unsourced synthesis alongwith that certain details of Khuzaima Qutbuddin has also been deleted it is they who are using the policies of Wikipedia to get this article deleted and trying to rope you in too please try to understand the situation Which editor would put the article for deletion just to improve the article if they want to improve the could talk on talk page but there they just justify their deletions and advice me to stay out giving reference to various policies of Wikipedia i know i have a lot to learn but i am trying to but here they are just putting on an act to delete the article 

All this is happening because of some pov of Ftutocdg regarding Khuzaima Qutbuddin Just see his contrib you will see nothing but addition and deletion of Khuzaima Qutbuddin or details related to Khuzaima Qutbuddin from different articles and nobody stands to stop him but here i am trying to save an article and editors have grouped together to delete it what a effort and that too using the policies of Wikipedia i think atleast you should try to make them see reason and make Wikipedia free from people with wrong intentions vandals 

i am sorry this write up will go on top that is another point i wanted to discuss when editing fron mobile there should be some kind of way or button or link whereby one can go down and post there 

Sorry for your time and trouble thank you
