I disagree immensely I think that creating a mirror as a form of discussion would be
a tool useful to getting things done instead of bickering I hope that wikipedians will think
carefully about this suggestion because i know for a fact as a systems theorist that it
has enormous merit I hope that my example of how such a mirror would be used and how it
would be useful is not taken as what the process would look like I hope that you will reverse
your action after contemplation
