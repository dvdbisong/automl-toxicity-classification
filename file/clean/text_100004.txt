GSK Lee what I intended to say is that I Love Beijing Tiananmen is not grammaticallystandard Englishit reflects the Chinese word order and is somewhat comprehensible but is not logical in English because in grammaticallystandard English the specific place follows the larger place eg The White House Washington or the Tate Gallery London the complete contrary of Chinese Thats not to say that nongrammaticallystandard English should be forbidden especially from songpoetry but I think to most native English speakers this translation would be viewed as unusual or highly unorthodox But I understandappreciate your intent I dont mean to sound critical   0154 22 Jun 2005 UTC
