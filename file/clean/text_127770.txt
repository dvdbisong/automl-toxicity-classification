what i was upset about was not content but behavior  namely editwarring  People disagree about content all the time  What our policies and guidelines call us to do when there are disagreements about content  how to behave   is to stop editing the article and start talking and keep talking until there is agreement about what to do about content  Please keep these two kinds of issues distinct  
Most admin boards 3RR AIV ANI etc are for behavior issues  Dispute resolution DR talks about how to resolve content disputes none of which involve going to the admin boards   
 However none of the various DR tools are available to us until we have tried to work things out on the Talk page and we have barely started talking there  The fresh start discussion on Talk is the kind of thing we do for content disputes  we back up and talk about the fundamentals of content  namely sourcing  on the Talk page  
 If you have a different proposal about sourcing please make it on the Talk page  Thanks
