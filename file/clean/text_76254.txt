999 

Hi there

Ive seen you make quite a few changes to the plot section of Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors and thanking you along the way I was just wondering if you were going to work more on the article as a whole If you are then Id just like to mention that myself as well as a few other editors were also going to start working on that article soon as were pretty busy with its sequel Virtues Last Reward Were hoping to get it up to GA status and then move onto 999 Anyway regardless of what you say I just want to properly say thank you for helping with the article
