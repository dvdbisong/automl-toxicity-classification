Recent deletions
I have removed various references to songs that contain the progression for only very short irrelevant sections of the songs Why So glad to answer

 The source given is Music Notes sheet music which is a website that produces and sells arrangements of songs and nowhere states to be a faithful record of the song as written
 The Music Notes snippet shown is not enough to show that the song generally uses or does not use this fourchord convention
 The Music Notes are basically just appended on with no proof whatsoever that they show that the song uses the fourchord progression I could find the sheet music for any musical work you can think ofsay Beethovens Ninthand just tack on the Music Notes Nobodys going to pay five bucks to read it myself included to verify
 Those very same Music Notes do not even uphold the articles assertion in cases like Dont Stop Believing See measure 7 Thats a Gm chorda iii chord which is not in the poppunk progression G in the bass with G B and D in the treble Straight up Gm chord Definitely a iii

Ill be restoring the removals presently I guess Slash
