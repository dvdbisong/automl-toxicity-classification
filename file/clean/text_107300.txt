Cynthia what you write about Ed comes close to a personal attack Making personal attacks is not allowed and could result in getting banned Besides I do not think that Eds involvement in the Unification Church is a problem when writing here For example when I was a selfdeluded follower of Sathya Sai Baba I had no problem whatsoever to look objectively at other religious movements I only could not look at my own movement objectively What counts is the quality of the edits Not the religious affiliations of the contributors I have to admit though that I am interested too in Zappaz background but she is not obliged to answer your question  1831 13 Aug 2004 UTC
