Discussion on article content 

Id love to have a discussion on the article in question Except that the other party is not willing to have a civil discussion on it Instead he continues to dismiss every valid point I present claiming hes correct Then he finally says he will not discuss it anymore and instead continues to revert to his own edits Im sorry but how exactly am I supposed to establish a discussion with the person who ignores everything I post simply wiped his hands of the issue and claims that hes right no matter what
