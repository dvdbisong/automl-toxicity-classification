Mattissee 

Hi I was thinking to move all the detail regarding   
Technically yes but as the case is still being discussed internally I dont think any changes should be made for now   
Ok I will of course accept any internal decision regarding this issue   

 Additions to a SPI that you clerked 

I apologise for creating a moving target but since you clerked WikipediaSockpuppet_investigationsVikraantkaka29_June_2011 I have come across two registered users who may be connected to the original case I have added those to the SPI since it has not yet been closed You may want to take a look but I apologise if I am wasting your time There is something fishy going on but working out what is problematic

 Abortion titles mediation 

Ill tell you right now if we dont see significantly more response your idea regardless of its merits isnt going anywhere  A way must be found to increase participation   
Theres no way to force someone to participate mediation in itself is voluntary It might be a good idea to send another round of notifications but this time with wording that encourages them to add their opinion eg A proposal has been made to rename the two abortion articles to completely new names The idea which is located at Link is currently open for opinions Your thoughts on the matter would be appreciated or something like that anyway That should hopefully kick the discussion up a gear  The clock is ticking 
I think giving some additional exposure to that discussion is a good idea But personally I think the matter is likely to have been settled which is why I havent made any further points Unless there is a big change in opinion after 30 days you should just move the articles to their new titles    
The issue is mentioned on the abortionrights talk page but notifying involved parties as listed on the mediation talk page might be a wise move to take  The clock is ticking 
I did that as soon as that list was made    
Sure but it might be wise to post them a reminder like the one I recommended  The clock is ticking 
Fair enough    

Well between Eraserhead and I I think its safe to say that every single editor who touched either of those two pages over the past year has been notified Well just have to see what happens   
Well the input has certainly increased significantly Good luck to you sorting out all the opinions  No rush though  I think you should wait at least a month before deciding anything   
Indeed input has increased I think letting discussion car
