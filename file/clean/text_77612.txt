Thank you 

Hi James

I just wanted to thank you for blocking someone yesterday  Its   I had requested that they be blocked five days ago at WPUAA but the notice was removed with no further action being taken I then placed a request with admin  on his talk page but got fobbed off and ignored  Im just glad to see that I wasnt wrong about our policy regarding this user and thank you for eventually blocking him from using Wikipedia  player
