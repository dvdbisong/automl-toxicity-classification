crossposting 

It really looks like you cross posted to WPRFI in good faith so please take this as a friendly tip rather than a warning its better to post a page diff from the edit history or introduce a quotation and use italics if you really feel the need to cut and paste  Emulating another editors signature is bad form and an administrators signature is dangerous territory  Another user who was in a very different position from your own when from a one week block to a site ban for impersonating an administrator the other day  I dont think anyone will misinterpret the particular cross post you did but dont make it a habit  Regards
