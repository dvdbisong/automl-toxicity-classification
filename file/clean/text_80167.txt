Uranium mines in Namibia 

Hi Bine mai namibnut again about uranium I am slowly figuring out how things work so apologies if this is the wrong way to address these issues After reading about Aussinanis and writing a message to you I clicked on the Uranium mines in Namibia link and now realize you have made all the entries there May I point out some detail that might just be important as far as Wikipedia is concerned There is a major distinction between a mine and an exploration project Currently only RÃ¶ssing Langer Heinrich Trekkopje and Husab can be called mines Husab is in the process of construction so one can call it a mine Valencia is called a mine because there is a signboard on the road that says Valencia mine but they never advanced beyond the midexploration phase The reality is that none of the other projects are further than advanced exploration Even Trekkopje is technically still constructing but have actually shut down because of the poor economy Some of the Reptile projects eg Omahola and Zhonge Resources have received mining licences but it is unlikely that they will be developed soon the uranium price is far too low for economical extraction and will remain like that for some time to come
