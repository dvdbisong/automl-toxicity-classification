Please do not confuse my removal of the table with any desire to stop you from editing But I am afraid that the table in its current state is an utter mess which hardly give any meaning It actually gives so little meaning that I am somewhat amazed that you dont see how much of a mess it is I dont really know where to start because I dont understand what it is even trying to say For instance what is the point of all the    signs Why are some of the text in bold and why is some of the text in caps What does any of  TAB mean What is the point of putting the names in different places horisontaly in the various boxes Why are there randomly put in various years together with the names Most importantly what is and where are the chronology The entire table is just a jibberish mess I dont find anything meaningful about it
