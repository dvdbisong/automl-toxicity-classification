August Burn Red
Hello I just wanted to have a friendly discussion about on of the sources you have on this bands page The source is cited to alternative rock but the source aol music lists it as rock  alternative Now if you click on the genre on the aol page it takes you to a list of other rock  alternative bands  Taking a look at this list it is clear that rock  alternative is a combined list of bands from the rock genre and the alternative rock genre as bands on the list such as ACDC Hinder Daughtry etc obviously dont fit into alternative rock Therefore I do not believe that your source EXPLICITLY states what the bands genre is Im not trying to get into another big argument so I wont take your source down right now I just want your opinion on this
