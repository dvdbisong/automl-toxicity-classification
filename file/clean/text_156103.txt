Quick Question on Sephardic Jews 

Hello all im not a jewish person but have a great deal of interest in both Israel  Judaism and have doubts as to the meaning of sephardic jew

Wikipedia  other inet resources have given me the definition most of you will know from Iberian peninsula emigrating to the mediteranean region etc but what raised my doubts is something else

I recently saw a documentary which claimed that Sephardic jews originated from a tribe in a land adjacent to israel in the north though i forgot its ancient name The kingleader of this tribe was deeply impressed with his jewish neighbours and converted himself as well as all his people to judaism

I can find nothing to back this up and would love any imput youre wishing to provide

Thank you all
