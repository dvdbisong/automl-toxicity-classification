First of all I understand that you have a stake in this article  Youve put a lot of time and effort into it and you dont want to see it deleted  I had an article deleted once and I understand the frustration that you feel  

If you read what constitutes a notable organization in WPN and WPORG it doesnt really meet the criteria set forth  Yes youve provided some sources that mention the Bulldog Party but they arent really considered Significant coverage which means that sources address the subject directly in detail  Also WPORG states Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found however it does say that The organizations longevity size of membership or major achievements or other factors specific to the organization may be considered  The Bulldog Party may have been around in some form since the 1950s though so maybe that might help  if you can prove it 

The possible longevity and the major achievements and other factors specific to the organization is where you stand the best chance of defining why its notable because of this statement in the article The Bulldog Party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout Missouri most notably the Bearcat Voice at Northwest Missouri State University and the Student Progressive Party at Lincoln University Missouri  However this isnt sourced at all and quite frankly its questionable whether the Bearcat Party article meet the notability criteria as well

If I submitted this article to AFD would it definitely get deleted  Most definitely not  Theres a good chance that it would but its not a given  However no one could make the argument that its good enough as it is and its notability shouldnt be questioned 

Why has no one else brought this up before since you first created in March 2005  Probably because it hasnt attracted a lot of attention and overall its wellwritten  There arent many other articles that link to it so unless someone stumbles across it through those links the only other way someone will find it is via Random Pages unlikely with over 2 million other articles or through Recent Changes and since there have been barely over 50 edits in 3 years thats not likely either  especially if the edit wasnt vandalism

Keep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping
 I like it or Its interesting
 It took me a long time to write
 This other student political party has an article
 It looks good or It doesnt do any harm

Im not going to submit this article to AFD but you really need to work on getting it fixed if possible because its likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that I did about it   Good luck and happy editing
