Hi Rjensen Thanks for getting back to me I just checked both images and it looks like OTRS has received the permissions email from Peabody and the images are approved for use on the site Peabody is aware that anyone is able to use these images now that they are licensed as ccby30
Would you be able to add one of these images to the Modern mining section
