Zeitgeist 
Regarding your edit with the description touched up a bit of the language why call it Corgans decision to reunite the band with only two members whats the source on it being Corgans CHOICE  I didnt revert your edit because its just as accetable but I think what that sentence is saying is that he made the decision to reunite with only 2 members regardless of whether that was his original intention  In the end its still his choice to go ahead with 2  Make sense Cheers
