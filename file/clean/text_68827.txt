I see two possibilities here  One is to enable this page to discuss the trial  all of the trial all of the discussion not just a small portion that is conveniently here and the rest removed  The other option is to remove the block of the original Amanda Knox page  There is no reason there cannot be a page dedicated to her intead of only redirecting here  There are clearly two points of view here  Amanda is guilty and Amanda is a victim of a bad legal process  They should both be freely discussed and not censored
