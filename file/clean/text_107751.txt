I forgot to comment on the phone bill part If you use a prepaid phone service you usually dont get a normal phone bill where different costs are itemised Instead you just notice that the costs covering your phone usage have been charged from your phone balance The only way for me to check how much a specific call has costed me is to make a balance enquiry before the call and write down the balance make the call and then make another balance enquiry comparing the two amounts   0941
