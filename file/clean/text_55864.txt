A Floppy Version 

I deleted the lines in the article which referred to The Dig being released on floppy  While my recollections of 12 year old games may be slightly rusty I am virtually certain that The Dig was only released on CDROM  Given the amount of work and money put into the voice acting and prerendered cinemas it would have been insanity to try to make a floppy version which would have required even MORE work coming up with static screens to cover the missing movies

There was a 30meg or so demo released around 1994 which could have with compression probably fit on 12 floppies  Thats likely what the editor was thinking of  If someone can come up with concrete information on the demos release it would be a good addition into the release section
