Re Neither of these quotes are out of context and both represent how historians consider John Punch  By historians I assume you mean more than one as in two  I dont know how you know that any single other historian on earth agrees with the statement verbatim first official slave in the English colonies  Theyd be pretty stupid if they did  The first official slaves in the English colonies were in the Sugar Islands where slavery was legislated before 1640  That is what I mean  at least one example of  when I say out of context  You are presuming which I believe it considered OR  And I could care less what you or WP think about emails from authors  It satisfied me and that alone is enough for me  Stop pretending you are better than everyone else  Have you corrected the tags I bombarded the article with yet  I am not deterred by rodents  Have you corrected the citation errors  told you about yet  Stop lecturing and start repairing the injuries you create    2350
