You asked Do I want Esperanza back 

Im sorry I dont really know whether or not I do anymore There is a pervasive fad in taking a bootcamp attitude to what wikipedia contributors can do and it seems toward the end that Esperanza tried to conform to this belief rather than defy it as evident in the paradigm shift during Esperanzas overhaul as well as the communitys deletion of the coffee lounge and most games on wikipedia This is why I am hesitant to develop an opinion either way what kind of Esperanza are we talking about here FWIW I dont believe that getting rid of silly perks ever did anything good Personally I never played any of the games as I recall but their presence made a difference I suppose its hard for me to explain but sometimes the mere possibility or existence of something achieves much more than any active working process which is what Esperanza did for me  talkAdvise me
