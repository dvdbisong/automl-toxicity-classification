Ive tried to explain to you problems with statements like all mainstream jewish groups oppose jews for jesus   If you cant understand this Im not sure where else this can go   Perhaps you might benefit from visiting the talk page off WPNPOV and some other editor can explain why this is not permissibile at wiki   Their are indeed many povpushing elements to this page   Things like the gigantic Christianity template used to warn people abot this group
