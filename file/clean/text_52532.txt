Increasingly concerned this article misrepresents bondesons book
Whatever Bondesons credentials i think the central claim of this article that upon Hitlers orders superdog members of the SS were being sought founded solely on a book by Bondeson that none of us has read is probably false In this BBC article httpwwwbbccouknewsukwales13568270 Bondeson complains A rise in schools of animal psychology in the 1930s was encouraged by the Nazis and Hitler in particular and their potential military use examined But thats a million miles away from the press claims  which get taller by the day  that the Nazis had a legion of talking machineguntoting hounds on the point of being unleashed on the allies At any rate Im not sure any of this article should be taken seriously until someone actually reads the book the only source for the material rather than second hand apparent misreadings according to Bondeson in the BBC article by the likes of The Sun Do wikipedia articles about books get routinely written without the book having been read
