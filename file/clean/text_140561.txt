Your RFA

I apologise but I have closed your request for promotion early as the application was certain to fail the basic requirements expected of applicants NOTNOW given the scarcity of experience particularly in areas related to administration If you remain interested in becoming an administrator I would definitely recommend that you familiarise yourself with the guidelines on RFA applications GRFA before attempting the procedure again Good luck User talkMephistophelian contact

You accused me of vandalism in your summary of  this edit Dont do that again

Earlier I had edited the Tom Rice article to improve it from a bloggy pov poorly written mishmash to a reasonably encyclopedic article an ongoing task I took it from this abomination to this

I have reverted you and suggest you dont revert me again Instead if you believe I am wrong you can report me elsewhere or ask for comment elsewhere

Hi Ive mentioned the copyright problems here Any help you can give in removing material that you know youve copypasted and then noting that its been removed would be appreciated  talk 
I doubt anyone would want you to quit I know I dont but it is very important that you respect copyrights  IMHO nothing is a bigger threat to the continued success of Wikipedia than copyvios  The potential for the foundation to get sued is far bigger than it is for libel by far  I have been screamed at told off and generally put in my place dozens of time since I have been here and fully expect that I will again many times  It would be really nice if everyone here was kind and respectful but just like society in general that just isnt the case  My suggestion to you is to ask questions get help when you need it make friends and continue to work on articles you like  The best thing I did after I got here was to get adopted  There is no textbook for this and adoption provides you with a teacher that will walk you through the ropes and be around after you graduate to mentor you  Another great thing here is the Teahouse  It is a place especially for newer users to ask questions and get answers without attitude  My dad always used to say that the only stupid question was the one you didnt ask and the Teahouse definitively follows that credo  I will leave you an invite after this message  I will also be happy to help you in any way I can  Just drop a note on my talk page  Welcome to Wikipedia and happy editing   
 Hi Sk8terguy27 I have removed your recent addition to the article David
