When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23 he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics Munthe had however been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholerastricken population 1880 on the island of Ischia 1883 in Naples

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome as well as by Italian patients He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria later queen from 1892 until her death in 1930

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France He described his activities in the book Red Cross  Iron Cross which was published in London in 1916

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly destitute people in a castle outside Rome He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe although it includes much of what he had already written earlier His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper Stockholms Dagblad and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885 in England in 1887 and later in 1910 in Italy Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published for example Små Skizzer published in Stockholm in 1888 Vagaries London 1898 Memories and Vagaries London 1908 Bref och Skizzer Stockholm 1909 En gammal bok om manniskor och djur Stockholm 1931 Vagabondaggio Milan 1933 Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren Leipzig 1934 etc

Hildasholm the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 19101911 was designed by the architect Torben Grut who would later create the Stockholm stadium It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th 18th and 19th century Europe It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months 

The gardens were created by Axels wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment
