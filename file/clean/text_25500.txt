Oxford was Shakespear 

Anyone who REALLY knows Shakespear and then reads all they can about the life of Edward de Vere 17th Earl of Oxford surely becomes convinced that they are one and the same person

I have written 4 plays on the Earls life as Shakespear which seek to redress the gigantic injustice done to him and am happy to provide brief FREE EXCERPTS  simply email mmckernoptusnetcomau

Thank you
