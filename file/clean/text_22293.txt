Here we are I was waiting for this kind of xxx comment xxx is to spare the appropriate word to qualify SupaStarGirls comment

The articles on Wikipedia do not belong anymore to anybody once they are posted It means that anybody can come and modify these articles at will irrespective of the original persons who posted them So your remark SupaStarGirl is not a remark from a Star at Wikipedia I could say

Anymore comments before I close the discussion on this article And move on with my life that is not fpcused on wasting it trying to write a PERFECT article 
Once the discussion is over I will republish the article with the changes I made and we will all have to leave in peace this article if those among you who censored my useful contribution are capable of such a normal behaviour I very much doubt it

I ask Tawker to avoid censoring the discussion area by reverting to the previous posting when I made changes I clearly mentioned the changes I made openly and there is no justified reasons to revert to the previous posting made on the discussion
Are you now going to censor even the discussion If I decide to delete what are perceived as personal attacks it is my right to do so without having someone like Tawker censor this change and revert to the previous posting Is it clear Tawker I would not be very proud of behaving the way you have done I could qualify your behaviour but I will leave it as it is for the time being I have very little tolerance for your shameful behaviour Tawker Do you get the message
