A suggestion

Why dont you take all but Greg Ls original complaint out of WQA and move it to the talk page leaving behind a note that discussion on the issues is at TalkKilogram where it belongs and that the additional rambling discussion has been moved to Wikipedia talkWikiquette alerts  Seems pretty simple and obvious to me
