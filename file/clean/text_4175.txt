Marnanel your talking nonsense there is no dispute in the real world
Money magazine wrote that article after complaints were made is now out dated Stevensons legal battles have been settled for some time All the text vary from each other which is reflected on the page There is no dispute between Powers and myself Her attorneys were contacted and since then her products have reverted to her particular text only The problem was these people thought they could cheat me and they got caught Now they have suffered terrible embarassment over it The matter has been resolved and I Am Not willing to sacrifice my legacy with the public hog washing these stories Enough is enough Money Magazine never interviewed one single author for that story My legacy does not revolve around Money magazine but my authorship And if you want to present the Footprints Poem in the Wiki
you must show the chronology of the poems history 

What is it that you need to present reliable source to this article
Be specific I removed my published book from world wide marketing
is that enough proof of authorship for you If so then see authorhouse for details or contact me Thank you
