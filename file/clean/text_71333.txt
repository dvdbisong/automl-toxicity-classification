Criteria for Statistics Column 

Hi there
I am very confused with several things in statistics column I couldnt find any specific criteria for this section Let me clear one by one easing to answer

1 MonthYear of statistics
Which month the stats should start In metro airports like BLR MAA HYD and CCU it is mentioned from April 2010  March 2011 But in DEL and BOM month is not mentioned
When to update these stats Monthly or Yearly In above mentioned airports it is still until March 2011 Lets say if it is monthly how to do after one financial year In first month April only and in next month April  May
May be this is silly question but just to clarify What phrase we should use for MonthYear I found several methods They are April 2011 Apr 2011 April 11 Apr  11 Which is better to maintain a standard format for all airports in India
