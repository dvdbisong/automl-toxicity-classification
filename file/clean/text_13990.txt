I know you are writing these things in good faith Yop but your claim that Warrens skin or hair color calls into question her claim to Native ancestry is offensive On that logic the racial identity of everyone who identifies as racially mixed but looks white should be questioned The difference between Warren and whitelooking mixed people such as Mariah Carey and Rashida Jones is that the latter have actual identifiable parents or grandparents who are racial minorities African American On the other hand all of Warrens ancestors are white That is why she was and is criticized for this She said she was a minority when her whole familyincluding distant ancestorsis lilywhite Finally it is preposterous to suggest that Warren looks minority in the picture you wish to insert in the article She looks completely white in all pictures While some people who look white are multiracial in her case she looks white because she is fully white
