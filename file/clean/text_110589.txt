There is plenty more to discuss though possibly futile anyway as I dont get the impression that reasoning however cogent is going to make a blind bit of difference here If you had a NPOV on this dispute then Machine Elf and Philogo would also be blocked or better nobody would be blocked but the article would be locked on the current version Clearly this is not the case  now why is that By WP policy a block cannot be punitive only preventative but this block changes nothing about the situation so you are acting against your own policy So I challenge you either block me and thousands of other innocent potential contributors indefinitely for trying to improve an article that Machine Elf and Philogo clearly have control over or try to resolve the issue in a more constructive manner and I have already several times expressed my willingness to work through any specific issues relating to my edits of that article but the current block serves no constructive purpose and only escalates bad feelings
