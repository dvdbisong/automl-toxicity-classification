To Paul B or whomever has taken the responsibility for editting this work While I admire your dedication to upholding a neutral point of view in this article I must voice the opinion that youre lack acknowledgment towards the fact that he iswas a controversial figure to Indians is not inline in general with wikipedia There are many examples of articles on this website that provide info about controversial issues in a neutral position while usually providing material for and against the issue I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it Finally your vehement refutation of other sources based on who is he shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others I would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article please do so by giving both sides of the story Incidentally Im not a nationalist and Im not a member of hindutwa I am however a person that likes to search for and be presented with all relevant informations whether they are contradictory to my own opinion or not  Raj
