Also ref to Krishnamurti  this really quite excellent entry on Mrs Besant rather softpedals the controversies surrounding Mr Leadbeater and her peculiar and continuing support of him  He was accused repeatedly of molesting young boys and for a time was drummed out of the Theosophical Society on those grounds  Mrs Besant saw to it that he was reinstated  Particularly in the case of Krishnamurti with whom Leadbeater was accused of child rape it would seem impolitic to associate them in this article without some acknowledgment that there were difficult issues  After all Mrs Besant lost her own children in a notdissimilar way to the circumstances under which Krishnamurtis parents lost him  I met and talked to Krishnamurti in 1969 in connection with a film at his compound in Santa Barbara California and brought up the subject of Leadbeater  He told me in no uncertain terms and with uncharacteristic illtemper that he would never discuss that man  All of this has been a point of public discussion for some time and I wonder if there ought to be a further unearthing of sources for an article that associates Mrs Besant Mr Leadbeater and Krishnamurti  kentfx
