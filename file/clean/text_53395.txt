Im very new to editing on wikipedia so Ill be needing a lot of help on this one Please Anyway Im not sure on how to get the page to stop asking for a Publisher and Developer in the box on the right since this is a video game console and not a video game title Sigh Also this page used to be a redirect to the Twin Famicom clone which is a completely different thing I hope this helps someone out there

In the meantime all help in improving this page is of course appreciated
