Disagree Jayron  Im not using Eubulides affiliations against him  Im merely stating a fact  His edits are not good are are severely biased AGAINST chiropractic including unilaterally deciding what is an acceptable reference and how it is to be used   Just like how youve unilaterally blocked me without proper discussion especially with the points raised on MastCells talk page  Regardless all the points I raised above are valid and one needs only to look at the talk history to see how Eubulides and Quack Guru have seized the day and implement their agenda of fear mongering edits and having a double standard with respect to the chiropractic article  If I can make a formal complaint Id love to do it because I had been intending to do so until Eubulides sneak attack to admin MastCell whom I owe an apology
