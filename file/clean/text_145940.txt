Im rather leaning towards Damel as the primary name But I didnt think the move should have been done without a longer and more collegial discussion I see a number of Gbook results for Damelis  but possibly more for Damel  It can be hard to determine how many Gbooks are in English Sometimes they have EN abstracts or forewords or whatever I would like to see consensus here before the move  MK
