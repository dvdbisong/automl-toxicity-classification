Actually the Sharon Weinberger article in the Washington Post might be useful to allow the lead to clarify that psychotronic weapons are another common term for mindcontrol technology The parapsychology stuff is valid background but the mindcontroltechnology context seems to be the most notable use of the term and probably should come first However per Weinberger we could specify this interpretation of psychotronics is primarily used among conspiracy theorists fringe writers etc
