God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations  However some commentaters notably E W Bullinger argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the world that was  I have researched and understand Bullingers argument  I will present it here

NIV

Ge 11  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth 2  Now the earth was formless and empty darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters

KJV

 Ge 11  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth 2 And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters

Now the English word formless in the NIV and the english words without form in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu GK Number H9332 and Strongs Number H8414  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as to lie waste or simply waste  

Likewise the english word empty in the NIV and the english word void in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu GK Number H983 and Strongs Number H922  Strongs Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin

Consequently it is argued that the verses could be considered something like  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters

Furthermore Bullingers observations continue to and link 2Pe36 which states KJV 2Pe36 Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge112 and not the flood during Noahs time  He concludes with The creation in eternity past to which all fossils and remains belong  Companion Bible page 3

Consequently the articles should include in my opinion the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds

See the Bullingers side notes 

Also a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters  with Bullinger  

To summarize  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old   Vacuous Poet
