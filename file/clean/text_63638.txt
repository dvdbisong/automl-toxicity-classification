I think theres some confusion over numbers of the complete glasses  Ettinghausen and Grabar only suggest one for Minden not sure where you got the figure of two from I got one at Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg from  but now I start looking more thoroughly I cant find it anywhere else Erdmann says there are two at Namur and other sources corroborate that  Annoyingly I dont have access to Jstor so cant check the rest of the articles cited to see if they elaborate  Also for the fragments  where there is more than one fragment its not made explicit what the minimum number of glasses represented by those fragments is as far as I can see 10 fragments doesnt necessarily  10 different glasses 8114714865
