Automatic protection for Main Page It would be straightforward to write a bot that 1 protected all images on the main page adding TemplateMprotected and 2 unprotected all images with TemplateMprotected that no longer appeared on the main page Feature 2 would be genuinely useful and save editors work However if editors came to rely on feature 1 then that would introduce a risk because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it A clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap And worse the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image I suppose the bot could attempt to detect vandalism like that but you can see how complex the process could become  0813 2005 May 13 UTC
