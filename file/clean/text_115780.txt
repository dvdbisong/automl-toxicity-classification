UCMMA 

I do not undertsnad your true motives for the removal of the UCMMA Wikipedia page it has already existed for as long as 3 years the same time as the first UCMMA event which replaced what would have been Caage Rage 29 at that time if not for EliteXCs demise From looking at your talk history you clearly show that you are not the right person to be making decisions on MMA related topics People from the MMA community should be given the right to do so as they can give accurate information about any Mixed Martial ArtistMMA promotionMMA related topics and that people like you are not looking for the best interest for MMA but for bringing down these peoplecompanies that are probably doing more things for their sport in the last hour than that you can do in a week for you to be sitting on your computer insulting them by saying that they are not relevant is an unnecessary low blow and that your opinions do not matter Please do not take this as slander for it is not slander if there is truth being spoken Thank you for reading
