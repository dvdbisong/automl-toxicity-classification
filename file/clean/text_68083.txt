Florence Cassez 

I feel I should offer my side of this story since I dont react kindly to accusations of racism I stumbled across this article whilst browsing the Recent Changes list hence the speed of my revert I noted that substantial unsourced and potentially COI text had been added constituting a major alteration to the bias of the page and deleted it per WPNPOV Without sources such information is flagrant POVpushing  had sources been cited I would have been perfectly happy to let it stand

I knew nothing of the Cassez case before arriving at this article and acted purely in line with Wikipedia policy Cassezs guilt or innocence is of no concern to me or to Wikipedia what does concern me is the addition of nonneutral text without adequate  or indeed any  citations

Perhaps you might like to take a moment to read WPAGF before casually flinging accusations of racism and censorship in the future
