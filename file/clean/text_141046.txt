Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes  Firstly  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the  of schools teaching in Ukrainian  I did this bc using partly to characterize 48 and overwhelmingly to characterize 70 is really pushing it  48 is almost 12 and 70 is about 34  Partly sounds like 1525 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 8599 broadly understood

Now about the Kievs school district footnote  In my opinion whereas the information is true it is too narrow for our purposes here  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate  As for Malenovskis article the issue was unverifiability of the statistics  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers towards the end  They are there but no original source is named no link is given for verification of the numbers  Finally I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sourcesarticles dealing with the Holodomor article  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov in this case is rather unacceptable

By the way I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English Polish or Ukrainian  How can you not love

Как упоителен как роскошен летний день в Малороссии  Как
томительно  жарки те часы когда полдень блещет в тишине и зное
и голубой неизмеримый океан сладострастным куполом нагнувшийся
над землею кажется заснул весь потонувши в неге  обнимая  и
сжимая прекрасную в воздушных объятиях своих 

But then again works in the original are better whatever the language  I digress and stop
