Please note that it is not prohibited for editors to have sockpuppets  It is merely prohibited to use sockpuppets either a to evade a ban or block or b to generate the false appearance of consensus or the lack thereof  The only time a sockpuppets edits are revertible on sight is when the sockpuppet was created by a banned user which quite clearly is not the case here
