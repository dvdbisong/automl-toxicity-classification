I object to the complete paragraph though for different reasons for different parts  The first sentence is referenced but by Slashdots own website and not an independent secondary source which is what is required for reliability  The second sentence on the other hand seems to be pure speculation and original research

Id also like to remind you that any editor is welcome to remove any information on Wikipedia that is not reliably sourced and if you want to revert them it is incumbant upon you to provide proper sources
