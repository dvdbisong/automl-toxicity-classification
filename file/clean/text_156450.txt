Hegumen you need to brush up your German I believe that you intentionally fail to notice the following quote westbulgarisch macedonisch Whether the sources are suitable is the readers right to decide Many sources speak of multiple Bulgarian recensions and two major literary centres in Bulgaria
Second the Ohrid Literary School is Bulgarian by ethnicity There are no authentic sources which mention Macedonian ethnicity prior to the 18th century On the cotrary they mention Bulgarian and Slav concurrently Can you prove me wrong If you continue to dispute the sourced information I will expand the section to prove my point about the Bulgarian character of the Ohrid Literary School However I hope we can reach an agreement on the current state of the article as it treats the language issue generally without focusing on separate schools
