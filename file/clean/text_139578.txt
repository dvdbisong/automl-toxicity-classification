Best bet is to ask John Freeman for the specifics and if it is from the printed bio then just add that into the general references area  it might be obscure but it is legit I added an obscure bio for John Higgins John Higgins comicsReferences and as long as it is out there it is easy enough to reference  if anyone raises an eyebrow Im sure we could get a scan but it should be fine
