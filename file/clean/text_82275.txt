Finding a reference for Cuchifrit√≠n being played by two actors might be hard you simply just notice its two different boys when you watch the show  The reason is probably because small children that age babies really can only be asked to work for a limited amount of time  I believe those laws apply in filmmaking here too  Dont worry about the plot summaries take your time going over them  I still have to rewrite the first episodes summary too
