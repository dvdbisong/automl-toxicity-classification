People who argue that he is indeed African American are indeed missing the point Just because hes an African American doesnt mean he should be LISTED as so Would you list Champ Bailey for example as playing in the National Football league under the Redskins Of course not you would say he played for the Redskins AND the Broncos Similarly calling Barack Obama AfricanAmerican is only correct if you list that he is ALSO of Caucasian white ancestry I can see making prominence of the fact that he does indeed prefer is African heritage and actively reffers to himself as African American but it should be listed prefferebly in the opening paragraph as him being of mixed Caucasion and African ancestry 671801177
