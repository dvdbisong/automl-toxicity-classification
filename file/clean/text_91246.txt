Total Drama IslandAction 

I finally got Total Drama Island semiprotected  I am happy since they decided to protect it for a month and I only asked for a week  Anyways I also think Beth is going to win and the other characters in the exact same order as   I am not sure if Owen comes back but I did see the preview for the next episode and he was in it  However I think the show is going more downhill now that they are doing Total Drama the Musical  By the way on the TDA elimination table I dont understand why there are so many colors  It only makes it harder to read and more complicated  Plus for episode 20 there shouldnt be a spring green because there is no Gilded Chris ceremony  Just something to think about
