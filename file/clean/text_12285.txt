Reply to remark made on blocking admins page 

I understand that the blocking admin isnt interested in discussion of the issue on his page That is why I stated that I would be willing to pursue the issue formally but I would wait for him to resume editing since he is on a wikibreak I wonder why this simple thing was not clear It is unfortunate that there were a couple of ANI cases against me though I am lucky that nothing stuck
