Cleanup
Even though I write most of this I have to totally admit after reading it from start to finish that this article is a right mess The references are too webreliable there are also too many meaning the reference numbers make it look messy and clog things up and the references list is far too long for an article of this size 

Another thing I see wrong is the lack of flow the article jumps about a bit from one subject to another in the same paragraph the idea of a paragraph is to keep to one subject then if the subject changes start a new one looking back at what Ive done Ive gone against the basic rules of paragraphing

To be honest its as bad as a GCSE English paper entry Feeder have been going on for 16 years and deserve a miles better article I was thinking some of us could all club together and work on this together and make a fresh start  we could set up something like a Feeder Wikiproject and make a group of Feeder fans who are also Wikipedians to give the band the article they deserve and also work towards a view of getting it to FA status
