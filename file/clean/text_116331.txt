Clean up and criticism 

I attempted a bit of a clean up I dont know if it is sufficient to remove the tags at the top

If I have a general criticism to make of the article it is based on the remarkable lack of sources to substantiate the topic

Personally it feels to me as if some individuals are trying to make more out of subject title than is supported by the references That is to say they have been pushing the idea of the dog as a breed Even moreso relating to the nickname INDog 

Im also not sure about the watering down of the definition of pariah

Consequently Im also a little suspicious of the direction Pariah dog topic has been taken in eg who are the dog experts they claim The Wikipedian author themselves
