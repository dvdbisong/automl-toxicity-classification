And thankyou  for trying to show me the light But I did AGF in thinking that the omission of 1 word was an innocent mistake I repeatedly mentioned that I do not understand what was so wrong about my edit And there was an editconflict at the moment I was blocked where my comment asking that insteadof the change that I was trying to edit that I did not have a problem with working towards some OTHER text being used with the graph In my reply above and after thinking about it some more I am revisiting my original feelings about the inclusion of the graph in any articles for several reasons So from here on out I am committed to doingaway with the picture entirely Since you have been so helpful have you got any ideas about where my complaint would have a fair discussion Last time that I checked DRN was not overburdened but I would take my revised complaint to the articles TP first I guess taking your advice to AGF Personally I try to stay far away from ridiculous arguments and contentious editors because I feel like it is a waste of everyones time but the global warming topics representation on WP is showing the results of the battles that have gone on trying to defend the integrity of the articles and imo although I am trying to AGF there are enough protections in place to allow a little boldediting without being overly protective of every little thing2601C67838416BD199DFE2A64FBE3
