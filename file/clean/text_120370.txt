Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading Origins of the term states

Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation  it merely states that one or more must exist Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god342235 Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design The Kitzmiller v Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer ID leaders have indeed named the designer 

The articles reference 34 above is to Dembskis 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that intelligent design is just the Logos theology of Johns Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory When Dembski said that he was identifying indeed defining the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ to which Logos refers in the Gospel of John as Barbara Forrest points out on pp 34 of her paper httpwwwcenterforinquirynetuploadsattachmentsintelligentdesignpdf

See also the articles reference 142 at pp 3940 of Is It Science Yet Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution at  httplawwustleduWULQ831p20120Brauer20Forrest20Gey20book20pagespdf  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as theistic realism

So it is clear that it is more than a personal view of many proponents that the designer is the Christian God
