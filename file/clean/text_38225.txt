I thought there was some other intermediate step intended that could emphasize the frequency of usage of the term J as a concentration camp comparing to the frequency of usage of the term J as something else Anyway perhaps a research similar to one done before could help in deciding what the common name  WPCOMMONNAME is On the other hand primary topic should also be considered but im not sure which one should have precedent over the other Nevertheless i think that solely the sentiments of the inhabitants of current settlements  however important to be considered  cannot be an argument strong enough for implementing an intermediate step such as one suggested  simply because the frequency of usage of the term Jasenovac as a concentration camp is far more greater that the other frequencies IMO Regards  talk
