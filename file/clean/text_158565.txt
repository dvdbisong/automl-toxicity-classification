Thank you for reopening it Can you explain to me why I am getting so strongly opposed here Why people including admin are being so rude to me Why there are so many hateful comments to me Also could you explain to me why I am being considered disruptive just for applying I really do not understand why I should be punished for simply applying Are you saying that if I fail and apply again I will be punished Can you please show me the site rule that says that you can be punished for applying And when I say site rule i do not mean someones personal interpretation of a rule I mean where it actually says that applying is against etiquette and is punishable I have looked throughout the site and cannot find this rule So I would really appreciate it if you could show it to me since I am being threatened with the discipline of this rule i would like to be able to see it and read it myself Thank you for all your help and Im really not trying to be annoying or bothersome I just need to see the rule
