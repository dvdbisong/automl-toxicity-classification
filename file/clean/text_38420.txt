First of all I never ordered anyone Why are you so testy What did I do to you for you to take this so personally that you commenced this vendetta against my bio I have contributed NOTHING  to the article except on the discussion when ludicrous things were done to it I could have actually written the article itself and there is no prohibition to that I merely provided citations to others so THEY could post the page

Your answer says pretty directly that you want to force me to behave according to your will and will continue to retaliate  against the bio if I do not obey I honestly think its that behavior which is out of line on Wiki I have not touched the article except to add brackets around the word Englewood and advise on citation issues on the discussion page NONE of that is prohibited  ДрСДжПДС
