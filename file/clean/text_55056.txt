Thank you for your kind words
I never said you werent right that you had been treated badly though it was before my time I know you took my first comments as more of the same Anyway Wikipedia is amazingly useful but there are areas where the infestation of POVpushing trolls makes it inordinately difficult to get anything done Ive decided it isnt worth it for long periods of time marked by the uninterrupted series of Signposts you see above on this page But when I come to Wikipedia for its links and synthesis I am sometimes drawn back in by what appears to be an easy fix of something egregiously wrong Id enjoy it more if the opposition were more talented and less retarded or less protected by by the ecostructure but so be it Getting some appreciation which has been little and far between is in return appreciated
