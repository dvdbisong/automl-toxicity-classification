Not responding to the merits of any of the points you have bring up you have still not shown how Kelly is purposefully disrupting Wikipedia to prove a point  She isnt  So dont accuse people of things they arent guilty of  If you dont agree with her methods of trying to modify the procedure then you can say so but its unaccpetable to accuse her of violating some policy that she hasnt  Its like accusing someone of vandalism when their intent wasnt to vandalize eg they just messed up you simply dont do it
