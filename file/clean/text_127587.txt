Complaint about a stalker 

I have felt that a stalker Use Charles who has written to you some while ago above has stalked me occasionally several times

As example of stalking when I had been on 2 January 2008 reading material about White Rajahs of Sarawak and participated about some discussion there
httpenwikipediaorgwikiTalkJames_Brooke
then User Charles on 3 January 2008 had seemingly followed my edits and left his mark on talk page of one of those White Rajahs
Edit history

Stalking made by User Charles has got also more serious firms as he has however mistakenly tried to get to know my identity or to trace me through an assumed contact
In the following diffs User Charles is asking for identity

tries to get to know my identity

and another time

I hereby make this complaint of the said stalker
