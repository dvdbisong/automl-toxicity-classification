OK lets get it straightIs China proper a political term or geographical term  If it is a geographical term there is no way to include taiwan in China proper because TW is a island far from mainland  
If it is a political term  there is a term used by qing empire called 內地十八省
which means inland 18 provinces Here is the proof

sorry it is the same link but  a short while ago I didnt translate it right
但有時卻只指傳統的中國范圍即內地十八省而不包括蒙古西藏青海新疆東北和台
灣在內
translationsometimes china only means the traditional area of chinawhich means 
inland eighteen provinceit dosent included mongoliatibetqinghaiXinjiangmanchuria and TAIWAN

Here I have to emphasize the word inland and thats why the Qing officer didnt consider taiwan as part of the traditional area of china
