LOL oh I see now So my behavior on this board grants you the license to make digs and personal attacks against other users Whatever Last I checked there is no WKRetribution rule that lets you trash other users simply because they are not following the rules So according to your reasoning if I break the rules then it is okay for you to break the rules You are a hypocrite You are acting like the official Wiki vigilante who can go after people that you feel arent following the rules here I broke the rules But now YOU broke the rules too So I guess we are both guilty of doing nothing to get the article unprotected If you want to help build consensus on forum then you need to show respect to If you feel like someone is not showing respect on this board that doesnt give you the right to show them disrespect back And I find it telling that you dont deny that you are engaging in personal attacks Simply evading the charge isnt the same thing as not being guilty of it You and the redherrings
