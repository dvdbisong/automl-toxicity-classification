I was probably in bad mode that day Do not take it seriously However there is still question why most of the Wikipedia edits of one Swedish are about Kosovo My logic tell me that something is wrong there and I just do not like much when people lie about their identity But if you are Swedish then you should be more cautious about edits in one such sensitive question such as Kosovo The fact that Albanians from Kosovo want independence does not mean that you should reject some scientific principles and to post into these articles maps whose only purpose is to remind Albanians that they once lived in the countries which enslaved them I am Serb but I fully understand Kosovar Albanian point of view regarding Serbia As for these maps I wrote that to you in Serbian but I will repeat that in English if you write about one territory then you should post there only maps which show that territory with its own borders Two maps that you posted do not comply with this principle If any of these two actually showed Metohija with its borders within SerbiaMontenegro or Montenegro I would not object But to post only maps of these two countries with no borders of Metohija shown is not a science at all  talk
