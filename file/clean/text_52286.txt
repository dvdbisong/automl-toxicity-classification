First of all I have a right to request an honest higher up moderator in other words one who is known for not having an agenda because I have been abused by the very people you say I should submit to  Why would I do that  There are a lot of people on here who have agendas in their use of censoring and blocking that is a fact and just because there are many of them does not mean that they are correct to do this By the way my ridiculous post recently BTW  I have been banned for doing less then using a word as provocative as ridiculous is not at all  You in fact missed the point of the two or so sentence comment I was saying why do all of the photos with him posing with a fellow politician exclusively include Republicans that is a very reasonable thing to point out  Also if you think it is ridiculous that the Obama Admin would not be active on that page then I suggest kindly that you think again  It would in fact be ridiculous to think otherwise given that it is the first non  Obama Admin page one get when they look up his name and it is the most visited page on Wikipedia and the Obama admin is well known for heavy use of the internet  If I dont seem like an expert here its because Im not  hence me asking for HELP in doing the right thing I dont want an opinion poll I want people to look at what happened to me and see the abuse  Under your logic I should just shut up and let myself be abused even to the excessive point of blocking me from writing on my own talk page  

PS  you clearly are an expert so I cant help wonder why you didnt sigh your post    JohnHistory
