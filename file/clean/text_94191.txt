You could do it without it being changed just say that it has been subject of some dispute and you want to clear it up
But as I pointed out that can be changed before you make the request anyway  I doubt that Husond has changed his spots but it might be that he is trying to exhibit exemplary behavior for a couple of days  But somebody else could probably be talked into moving it first 
This would be of most benefit to those who unlike you havent been involved in such discussions before  1401 7
