You changed this article so Im going to take it up on this board 
The article says The first modern author to have published an essay explicitly advocating the absence of government was Edmund Burke in A Vindication of Natural Society 1756 That statement is 100 correct  It doesnt say Burke advocated the absence of government merely that he wrote an essay advocating the absence of government  If you want to add that most today believe it was an extremely subtle satire go for it  Thats how Wikipedia works  You think somethings left out you add it As for why you believe the statements of a politician running for office Er that work was a satire  yeah thats it over an anonymously published essay thats between you and God or Athena as the case may be Ill revert and add your concern
