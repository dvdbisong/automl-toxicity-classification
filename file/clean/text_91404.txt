This page was subjected to repeated vandalism in the nature of a hoax
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax beginning around December 2007 to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008 including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answerscom and other reference sites and these are being used to further the hoax  

The official website of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter Eleonora De Lennart in February 2008 and was serving as the reputable source for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci until the news articles came up in June 2008

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax  user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart
