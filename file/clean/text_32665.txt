More interesting things  According to pollstercom the Senate Breakdown remember only about 13 of seats are up for election every year should be

Democrats 54
Republicans 41
Independents both of whom sit with the Democratic caucus 2
Undecided 3 but all are in traditionally strong Democratic states so theyll probably fall into the Democratic column

Interestingly both Obama and Biden will need to be replaced in the Senate  Usually the Governor of the state in which those seats are held choose the replacement until the next election again usually  Obama is from Illinois the governor is a Democrat so will be replaced by a Democrat  Biden is from Delaware one of the most solidly Democratic states and the Democratic candidate for governor is leading by a huge margin so expect a Democratic replacement there

According to pollstercom the House of Representatives should fall as follows

Democrats  240
Republicans 179
Undecided  16

So the Democrats should control all three major elective groups   Talk Contributions
