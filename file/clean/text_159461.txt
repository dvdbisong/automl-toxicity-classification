Your discarding of vandalism complaints 

Re a recent vandalism report I submitted  the user in question has received numerous complaints including from bots and has resumed the same independent activity after being blocked a couple weeks ago The user is rarely using authoritative references but apparently only what turns up first on Google Id feel differently if the vandal were responding at all to any complaints or if the user werent making dozens of similar edits each day Ive learned my lesson from you and I wont complain about this user again and I certainly wont report any others that regularly trash WP with similar types of rumors and fake references so I dont expect a reply from you but I think you are making a serious mistake by not treating this as vandalism and immediately imposing restraints
