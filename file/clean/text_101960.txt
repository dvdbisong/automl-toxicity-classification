Turkish Liberation War 

Could someone please revert this edit as it is adding material to the caption of an expansionist war on the losses of the invader instead of the invaded making the article even more biassed then it already was to the detriment of the occupied country that has done nothing other than defending its territory I want to believe that the administrator who blocked meand other administrators for EDIT WARS are following the activities of the editor who accused me of the edit war This is a very good example of how I was forced to an edit war considering that one cannot make a war alone There are always two parties in a war
