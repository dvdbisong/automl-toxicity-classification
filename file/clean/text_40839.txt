Is policy policy or is it wikilawyering How can I disagree that the policy isnt being followed when I am being directed that way by the unblock denials I am being wikilawyered by pointing out a policy that has clear exemptions and at the same time told I cant use the same policy to justify a unblock Is there something wrong with this picture
