Meaning of Gogs 

Does anyone know the meaning of the title  I feel like it should be mentioned in the article  The only interpretation Ive found was in a YouTube comment

Gogs is a word to describe Gog which is short for Gogledd which means north this animation was made in wales the people who made it lived in the south of wales so piecing all this together this animation is basically taking the piss out of north wales people NICE i know this because i am a Gog

That actually makes sense to be honest  Does anyone know if its correct
