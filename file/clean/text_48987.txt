Now I believe you are done Sophia congrats  I will ping UserPonyo and UserAnthony Bradbury to see if we need to do anything more or be told anything more  
 Is everything kosher and Sophia is ready to be WPBOLD in mainspace now  
 As I understand it Phil her manager in the UK is still blocked save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures 
 Due to techrelated difficulties with inability to type colons perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasionandorsocking Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his UserWelshmusiclover account should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedianingoodstanding status  
 I believe that Sophia can if she so wishes give Phil some pointers on the wikirules and on the use of talkpages and other such topics which will immensely improve Phils chances of getting his own username unblocked  
 But they should both read WPMEATPUPPET very carefully so that they dont cross the wikirules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people  
 Sophia should exclusively use her own newlycleansed useraccount UserSophia GirouxRadisch and not only should nobody else use it directly nobody else should use it indirectly either  
 On the other reason for her old useraccount and Phils current useraccount being blocked Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for selfpromotion  
 This includes herself her albums her movies and so on plus also her other clients and her coworkers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment not to mention the corporate entity itself as well as her relatives and friends  
 She should remember the rules of WPCOI and WPSPIP and stick to making suggestions on the articletalkpages or in draftspace if she ever wishes to see edits made related to herself or her workplace  
 Admins is this advice all correct and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear before she goes on her merry way  And also I understand that it is customary to let cleansedusernames tidy up their old userpages and their old usertalkpages if they wish can she archive all this info here into the pageedithistory should she wish  Thanks for your help and guidance getting Sophia back up and working  7510894227
