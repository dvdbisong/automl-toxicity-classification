Your Edit on Filipinos 

I noticed your edit on Filipinos and your addition of Marcelo H del Pilar on the mosaic While there is really no problem with your edit it is important that you discuss changes on the articles talk page there is a section specifically for that if you scroll down to the bottom of the talk page

Also please make edit summaries to your edit to prevent another huge edit war from taking place   PacificWarrior101
