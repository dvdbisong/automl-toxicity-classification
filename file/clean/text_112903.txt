Please suggest replacement template 

Hi  You recently participated in a template deletion discussion  which resulted in the deletion of a template TemplateOtherusesSubtopicAlias used at the top of the article Positive airway pressure  The deletion discussion did not mention which template should be used as a replacement  I cant even see what the text was that was formerly at the top of the article as created by the template  Could you please suggest an alternate template to use at the top of this article Im also posting this request to the talk pages of others involved in the deletion discussion
