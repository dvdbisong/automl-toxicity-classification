I dont understand the significance of link number 8 above  It is supposedly the article when it was merged  But the merge itself is a change from what it used to be  It makes no sense to ask for an opinion as to whether your latest edit is better than it was after you first merged the article  Neither version represents anyones real input  Also I cant find in the revision history the first paragraph I remember seeing in the Virgin birth mythology article  According to some versions both articles began with a paragraph about the hero  This is not how I remember it  
The first paragraph of Virgin birth mythology about the statement that because mythological births were not virgin births they have no relation to the Christian story not the exact words was already in the first paragraph of the unfinished Virgin birth mythology  The finished wording may be awkward but it is only because I try to keep material that others contributed rather than delete it  However the original paragraph avoided mentioning that there are sources which show a longstanding tradition of comparison and the strict definition of a virgin birth has been no hindrance to this tradition  In the past the virgin birth part hasnt shut down the whole comparison as was attempted in the original material of Virgin birth mythology
