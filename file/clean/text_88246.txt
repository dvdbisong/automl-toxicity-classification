Comment on BSAASA 

Something which doesnt come out in the article but certainly up to about 196odd the ASA standard was a joint ASABSI standard but film speeds were commonly known as BS or ASA only because the arithmetic index was used in USA and logarithmic in the UK 
The point being that a conversion was exact as both indices used the same test method but DIN  BS  10  say was a good rule of thumb only
