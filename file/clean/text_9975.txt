Edit summary 

When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labelled Edit summary under the main editbox It looks like this

The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page in the page revision history on the diff page and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article See mHelpEdit summary for full information on this feature

When you leave the edit summary blank some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted so please always briefly summarize your edits especially when you are making subtle but important changes like changing dates or numbers Thank you  

I do when Im doing anything more than grammar The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat of which Im the only editor at present and I didnt think to add edit summaries Otherwise I believe that I have done so If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so Id be happy to explain myself Id much appreciate it  
See it for yourself Green bars are for edit summaries red bars are for edits with no summaries  
Thats quite a nifty tool there Im fully aware of edit summaries I dont provide edit summaries on my own talk page or my User Page I also dont usually provide them on other users talk pages In earlier editing I didnt take the summary seriously if youre referring to anything from several months ago or more I do apologize Like I said if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one please bring them up to me I would sincerely like to know Otherwise I dont see what youre trying to accomplish here  
I think the link speaks for itself  As for what Im trying to accomplish I think my original comment explained just that  
If you were trying to just helpfully remind me I thank you though I dont think it was needed I saw the page it didnt say anything to me except that I finally know my edit count If you really want to get a point across to me I suggest you do so blatantly If your original comment explained your motives then we are done here  

 Your nonsense page 

If you are interested in archiving your old talk you may want to review WikipediaHow to archive a talk page  Accusing other editors of defacing your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part and will only make you look bad  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talkCanaenarchive1  Furthermore making negative comments about discussion by other editors and claiming that their edits are not worth reading shows that you arent interested in abiding by  WPNPA WPCIV nor WPEQ  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors it might help to avoid incivility  
Im not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet but thank you for the suggestion I use nonsense in a lot of ways other people do not because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present Likewise  instead of cool or awesome or thats interesting Im currently in the habit of referring to things as nifty Its something I do I know how to archive a talk page Ive done it before I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack because Ive grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere Im not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words I thought that this was resolved by now I have quite decent relationships with other working editors it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along It is regretful but something which seems to be If someone takes offence to my creation of a Nonsense page they can bring it up to me personally as you
