I didnt say that constructive criticism is supposed to make you feel good I think your problem was that you right away stated what I needed to improve and did not even have time to give at least a thank you something I notice Ruhrfisch managed to do when reviewing the article What I meant is that when reviewing make an effort to say Thank you or Hope this helps Hopefully these should be more neutral than I like your work so far I apologize for the snide remark but please assume more good faith on your part Thank you  talk da contribs go rando
