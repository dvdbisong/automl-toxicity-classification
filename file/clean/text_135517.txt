True that its not a USonly project but consensus at WikiProject Television has shifted away from perfunctory inclusion of startsends in Englishspeaking nations unless there is a noteworthy reason to do so  If this were a German series I would argue that US airdates arent within the scope of our interest  Similarly I think the German info is not necessary  Yours is a reasonable argument for inclusion of the French dub since it did make press Anyhow not worth a fight but if it does get removed the consensus is already there
