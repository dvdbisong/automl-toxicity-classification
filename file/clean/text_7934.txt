OK no reordering But can we give them designations like this Im calling it List A so we can start a new list later without confusion If you dont like it well work something else out but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying Hey getting back to that thing we were talking about the bit where it says that Gage was traveling not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah

One point we absolutely cannot refer to Note X and Ref 22 and so on These designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy In the below Ive substituted permalinks instead 

Issues list A

A1 Background
A1a He may have gained skill with explosives on his familys farms or in nearby mines and quarries Speculation from Macmillan Attribute it
A1b Gages date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing

A2 Gages accident
A2a Does not address numerous theories presented or Gages actions prior to accident EEng knows all too well this subject I think Ratiu and Van Horns material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that Gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull I do not know why this is absent I have issues with the section but Ill hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now

A3 Subsequent life and travels
A3a bt February he was able to do a little work abt ye horses  barn feedg ye cattle c that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that  bore it well  Paraphrase
A3b  Would Gages mental impairment belong here I think it would be helpful
A3c  Missing Gages time in New Hampshire prior to Chile
A3d  Chile and California is missing the account of Gages doctor and missing some other tidbits not too bad  but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason
A3e This is also the key section that Macmillans research becomes quite useful as a case argument

A4 Death and subsequent travels
A4a  Still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home illness and death 
A4b Also the exhumation details  which was in Fleischmans book  is entirely absent This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important 

A5 Other matters
A5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well mostly avoided by the article Instead of proper detailing of the injury and Gages role in history 
A5b Only a few hundred words on Gages mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used
A5c Using passim and other issues in citing Macmillan is also a copout and would merit a verifiability failure
A5d Not even that it doesnt even credit Macmillan when it should

A6 Notes
A6a A substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes These complex rambling and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious
A6b A note like  which reads  See Macmillan  Lena349 Harlow12332345 Bigelow111617 Harlow9390 Macmillan186 is just improper
A6c  Note   Macmillans book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary  the definitive account 57  is just the type of note we do not need

A3c For Gages time in New Hampshire didnt he spent 18 months in a horse stable

The article says
Gage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover New Hampshire
Harlow says this began sometime in 1851 and He remained there without any interruption from ill health for nearly or quite a year and a half This fits with JMHs JHM  John Martyn Harlow information that PG went to Chile in August 1852 How about if we change it to 
For about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover New Hampshire
Thoughts   

A4a missing details surrounding return home illness and death

but he was in Chile for about 7 years correct Then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer  Im not sure if this is on one or several farms but wasnt the convulsions following a days labor on the farm The seizures
