Just for the record Castro apologised for his treatment of gays  While this doesnt mean that what he did was all fine now it shows that he is at least remorseful and has stopped persecuting people based on their sexuality In 1992 he told a Sandinista official

Im not going to deny that at a certain point this machista thing
influenced the approach that was taken toward homosexuality I personally 
you are asking me my personal opinion  do not suffer from this type of
phobia against homosexuals Truly in my mind thats never been there and I
have never been in favor nor have I promoted homosexuality nor have I supported laws against homosexuality

I dont see homosexuality as a phenomenon of degeneration but rather I see
it in another way The approach has been of another sort a more rational
approach considering the tendencies and natural things of the human being
who simply must be respected This is the philosophy with which I view these
problems I think that there has to be consideration shown toward the family
that suffers these situations I would hope that the families would have another
mentality that they would have another approach when something of this sort
happens I am absolutely opposed to any form of repression disdain contempt
or discrimination with respect to homosexuals Thats what I think Ð˜ 1215 Aug 19 2004 UTC
