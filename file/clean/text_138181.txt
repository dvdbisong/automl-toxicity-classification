Hi Paul

If you look at this pages history youll see a guy called Blofeld recently made a couple of very bizarre edits The guy then decided he was an expert on what is probably the most obscure sultanate ever to have existed This is obviously puzzling since the sultanate is in fact the area around my girlfriends back garden

But this is silly You should know already that theres a rather pitiful clique on this website They prop each other up in spats on various talk pages they support each others articles in the FAC process effectively devaluing the process as a result and seem to enjoy stalking and baiting other users To be frank I think its best to treat these little boys with the contempt they deserve Eventually theyll get bored and start creeping round someone else 

Ever heard of the forest Ton Sak Yai in Uttaradit A few days ago I uploaded an article about Bu√ßaco Forest in Portugal Next I intend to write a piece about Ton Sak Yai The forest is home to the worlds largest teak tree
