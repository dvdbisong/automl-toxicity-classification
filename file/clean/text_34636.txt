Well there are an awful lot of neighborhoods that could be up there  I say we should keep this one up until we have a more comprehensive map  The question is how many neighborhoods would be useful on a thumbnailreadable map  Currently we have 12 depicted I would guess at the very most we could have double that  Anyone want to venture which 24 or so should be included
