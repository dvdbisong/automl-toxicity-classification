 Isu personal best scores 
I understand that I get most of my scores from nonisu events I am aware of that I try to find the highest scores that each individual had earned And from now on if it is not under isu I will mark it under the info sheet when I create the edits Thx for understanding Have a nice day Happy New Years    Preceding unsigned comment added by 1737635243   

 Isu bests 
I am so sorry I just thought whatever their highest score is matters but apparently isu doesnt care they should include non isu eventys as personal bests I wish hopefully they will do that for the future I will not make any more edits because I feel like they wont be adequate or right to the isu standings thx for letting me know Have a great evening Happy New Years    Preceding unsigned comment added by 1737635243
