My RFA 

Hey thanks for participating in my recent RFA  You were amongst a number of editors who considered that I wasnt ready for the mop yet and as a consequence the RFA did not succeed 692611  I am extremely grateful that you took the time to advise me on to improve as a Wikipedian and Id like to assure you that Ill do my level best to develop my skills here to a point where you may feel you could trust me with the mop

Ive been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it support oppose and neutral alike  I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can  Cheers    the nonadmin formerly known as Budgiekiller
