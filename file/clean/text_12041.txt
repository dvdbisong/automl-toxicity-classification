An encyclopedia should have articles about specific subjects not specific words The word bluebell for instance refers to different plants in different parts of the world but an encyclopedia shouldnt encompass them all within one article  thats the job of a dictionary Instead an encyclopedia should have several articles on each different definition and my view is that this should also happen here Perhaps something like Cottage small house and Cottage holiday house would be a start
