The Loeb edition bears the inside title after the 50pp of introductory material Ammiani Marcellini Rerum Gestarum libri qui supersunt The volume titles are merely Ammianus Marcellinus although they include no other work by him since none has survived This inside title translates as The books that survive of the DeedsActsHistory of Ammian Marcellinus Nowhere have I been able to find where this Latin title comes from I cant remember reading or hearing anyone actually refer to AMs History as Res Gestae although thats a Latin phrase that can be translated history

The Divi Augustae sic on the other hand is a much clearer mistake which should have been  so to speak  Divi Augusti although FWIW not very much one can find RG Divi Augustae online Still its not right and anyhow RGDA always refers to the piece of Augustan propaganda

Ill revert the Loeb Reference although my edition doesnt have the same ISBN numbers  prolly better to leave those off
