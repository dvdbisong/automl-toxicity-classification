At this point I think maybe the best way to go would be to request the page be moved to something like List of cults sects and new religious movements like I proposed on the article talk page The early years of the study of NRMs did include a lot of discussion of what might today be called nonreligious cults like therapy cults which might not be specifically religious but do perhaps have most if not all of the characteristics of cults The RfC was closed based on the question of criteria for inclusion and taking that into account changing the title or otherwise changing the criteria for inclusion would be the next apparent reasonable step
