Apparently Google has just indexed Orrs article although they date it to 1993  He writes that Radagast and Variag which were obviously taken from Slavic originals and are recognised as such by all the critics The latter statement seems a bit vague to say the least And then theres a treatise by Clive Tolley in Old English influence on The Lord of the Rings where he writes that Radagast is derived from Slavonic aka Slavic  Anyhow the etymology of Tolkiens characters should either be treated in a relevant standalone article or in J R R Tolkiens influences but not in this article about The Hobbit
