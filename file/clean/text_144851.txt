This has been posted on Athaenaras own discussion page in response to a discussion between Athaenara and SethSwirsky which appears there  Its interesting that they felt it better to cozy up there rather than here on the pages directly associated with the article

    It is a complete and utter falsehood that I have sent any emails to this SethSwirsky person I suggest that this is just a member of the Tribe of Seth referenced in the article

    As for the actual Set Swirsky being a Democrat dont make me laugh The guy is a complete and total devotee of the Bush wing of the Republican Party As I have suggested if SethSwirsky is the real Seth Swirsky let him submit a blog piece to the Huffington Post detailing his points of agreement with the Democratic Party and saying hes a registered Democrat

    Of course no such thing will happen

    I find it interesting that this prolonged discussion is happening away from the article in question and find it cause to doubt Athaenaras objectivity in this matter
