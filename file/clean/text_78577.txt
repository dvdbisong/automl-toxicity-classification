Here is a summary of a phylogenetic tree based on analysis of the Y chromosomes of 1062 individuals from around the world The tree comes from  It has 20 population clusters but only captures 18 of the variation in the haplotypes That is many of the haplotypes are spread in various ways amongst the identified groups The details are given in a table in the paper

In the following

     X Y means X and Y are leaves that are directly joined together

The tree has three main lobes ABC

 A Sardinia
    Sudan Ethiopia
 B America
    Mali
    Khoisan
    SAfrica CAfrica
