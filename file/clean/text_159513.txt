Please view my video and pass it on to your friends and colleagues The more viewers I get will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies Chrysler Compuware dba Professional Services and Combustion Components to settle my 11 year homelessness

Search Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies Pratt and Whitney Williams International Ford Motor Company and as a contract engineer for Compuware dba Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills Mi It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers my private investigator and my newspaper reporter that I was not employed by them thus blacklisting me and preventing from all future employment

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chryslers automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington DC and in Bostons Federal court all courts denied me justice A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me 1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently will send Chrysler Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night

 

Thank you for your time and consideration
