Gosh Im impressed with your diligence  I had forgotten about leaving this message
The good news is I quickly moved on from that page and sought other projects  The bad news is I subsequently discovered as youve described that many policy pages get occupied permanently by a few editorial authorities  Between June and August I made many many hourslong improvements to policy pages which were quickly reverted It was very demoralizing and now I only edit in the article space
I think the best ie most altruistic account for this phenomenon came from UserSlimVirgin who suggested that longtime editors often grow to rely on the verbatim text of policies because for example they find it useful to quote the text in disputes with newbies  So thats a legitimate reason why policy pages can become so darn resistant to improvements
I was saddened to see that policy pages are afflicted by chronic sclerosis but I consider it a learning experience and Ive happily returned to adding material to the article space
