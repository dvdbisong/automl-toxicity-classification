Right now the section sticks out like a sore thumb as only highlighting racism by people from Europe Later in the article it even states that Arab prejudices were not based on religion but on race and there are quotes from notable figures of that era describing SubSaharan Africans in contempt Theres a documented racial element to it just as TST and colonialism had economical elements does not cancel that it was racist It also still exists in a country where all religions except Islam are banned somewhat negating the religious argument I would also argue for Zionism to be included as a UN resolution has classed it as racism and it has a significant history and geopolitical impact
