hi  wolf  this is  the  guy  from  the  Internet Television    page  etc

With all due respect

I read  your   reply  and  and the other ones  
I just can barley  reply  to   all these  wiki  pages  etcnot even sure if Im doing it correctly etcwiki  kinda  blowsgrin  its  way too complicated

I have a  word pad  doc  on my HD  that I wrote    explaining  my  Internet TV  rise on the netwith  each  step  documented  and complete  with   a  fast link  to the actual  source  material  etcNewspaper articles   story  the Annenberg school of communications at USC  in calif  did on me  in 2003  a  chapter in a book  dedicated to me  etc  and my stationsetc
  each  step  of mine  documented with a link  to the Source    NOT  just me saying it  there are also  links  to my  Old   websites   during that periodfrom the  actual Internet website archive  did  anyone  even READ    and check  these links  just HOW  Official   does this  source materiel  have to be  they are some  VERY  credible  sourcesetcgo look

its not just me  saying all thisits  the newspapers  of the townsand the  annenberg communications school at USC  and  the fact that the  Whois  data  for  DaytonaBeachLivecom   pre dates   anyone else claiming to  have done  Internet TV etc that I know  of   isnt that  KINDOF  Official   etc   I actually made history  by starting that TV station

I think the info should be  entered into the wiki  and LOCKED   until  someone  else  can   prove  an earlier date   and  BUMP  my slot  just Like  I do   with the guy from greece in 2005I was here   before him  etcand I can Prove it

wiki  just  will NOT  checkmy sources  are  VERY credibleand in englishgrin

its  a simple  VERIFIABLE factby newspapers  and the annenberg etc  go  check the  LINKS  I put inmost of them are my old websites  but two of them  are  My  claims to fame  along with the whois data  link for  DaytonaBeachLivecom  

chapter  8  in  this  book  Darknet   is  also   all about  ME
httpwwwamazoncomDarknetHollywoodsAgainstDigitalGenerationdp0471683345refsr_1_1ieUTF8qid1338078728sr81 

is  THAT  worth anything
grin

we need  someone   that can assemble   all this info into a  few paragraphs  with  all the correct links    to prove  everything  which I have provided etc
   and then enter it  into the  HISTORY  section of that page

if the wiki does not  put the  history info  in  then the wiki is  incomplete  and worthless as a  history check tooland will be  bypassed   by internet users   that will   use a more credible  and accurate  source  themselves  instead of the wiki  etc

if the wiki is not correct  or incomplete etc

the whois  data  says I started in 2000
annenberg says  I  was rockin HARD in Daytona   in 2003
daytona beachs  own  newspaper story  from 2002 
and  chapter  8  in the book  Darknet  are both   all about me  and  DaytonaBeachLive   

I included the actual links    to the articles  themselves I forgot the Darknet reference   etc
HOW  much  more  OFFICIAL  and credible  does the freakin wiki  require  etc  the links  to  the  source material is all thereand as credible  as it gets

I  AM  TheRavenand  I was doin IT  down in Daytona Beach   in   2000  to  2008 and CONTINUE  to operate as wellits just a simple fact
does wiki  deny this  or  NOT want to   record  and report the  correct history of  Internet TV

what say ye to this
