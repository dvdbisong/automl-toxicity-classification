Thanks 

Nah to be honest I have dealt with guys like him before and in real life He works on the basis that he thinks he can frighten folk off his territory by making threats scaring us with admins throwing as t as they can as they know some will stick  or as you say the stink of it will frighten others away 

I looked at the wiki mediation but it is all a waste of energy against anyone that is willing to spend the hours he has done putting together an entirely erroneous and dishonest RfC against Canaen

But I think I will write to the foundation and find out who their legal counsel because what he has written against Canaen is pure indelible libel Whereas mediation is a waste of time the foundation will jump if they start receiving legal letters requesting user contact details They have to be law

I approached both of them him and Skinwaker very reasonably in the first place and straight off received the same modus operandi he is what he shows himself to be BTW I have absolutely no connection with Canaen or anyone else but I recognise decency and indeceny when I see it

When does one fight fire with fire
