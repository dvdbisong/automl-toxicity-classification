Listen you are a student of criminal justice and not a specialist of Armenian history Moreover as far as I realized you are not a native of Armenia and did not study Armenian history in Armenia you are not even familiar with siomple and primitive things For example you did not even know that Armenia gained its independence only after Sardarapat So please stop editing anything about Armenian history You are doing a great favour to Azeri and Turkish propagandists by making horrible mistakes Please keep out of Armenian history sites If you had just a little competence about Armenian history you would never write that Turkey attacked independent Republic of Armenia before battle of Sardarapat
