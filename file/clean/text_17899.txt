If your research skills are not limited then your understanding of the facts or willingness to read what I have provided is    
   
Have you not read the study on park origins What part of it dont you understand If the NWPL was not responsible for the recognition of Sparks then I challenge you honestly with facts to support your argument to demonstrate who was    
   
Below are two more articles to convince you of your egregious error dare I say fabulation

 Sparks was founder of the park researcher says    
 By Dave Rogers Ottawa Citizen May 9 2004 p A9   
 Mackenzie King is often credited with founding the park but an exjournalist says Roderick Percy Sparks was the driving force Dave Rogers reports   
 The NCC has hired a pair of Outaouais historians to study the origins of Gatineau Park after it received information that contradicts the popular notion that William Lyon Mackenzie King was the father of the park   
 The evidence gathered by Chelsea resident and Senate speechwriter JeanPaul Murray suggests Roderick Percy Sparks played a far more influential role than the former prime minister in creating the park   
 Mr Sparks dedicated 25 years of his life to the creation of a national park in the Gatineau Hills and for 10 years was chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League a lobby group that encouraged the first government purchase of Gatineau Park   
 During the 1930s Mr Sparks and other members of the league argued there should be a national park in the Gatineau Hills because the widespread cutting of trees for firewood endangered the areas scenic beauty The government created Gatineau Park in 1938 but it is not a national park and has no legal protection as a park   
 Mr Sparks wrote the master plan for development of the park in 1952 The plan recommended that all private property in the area including his home be expropriated Mr Sparks vacant house on Meech Lake Road in the park burned under mysterious circumstances in 2001 two months after Mr Murray the former managing editor of the federalist Cite libre magazine began asking questions about its owner   
 There was no electricity or combustible material other than the building itself to create a fire risk nor was there evidence of fire starting from the nearby woods   
 No cause for the fire was ever made public The police did not release a report and the report from the fire authorities was almost a blank There was no cause no suspects and no investigation   
 An obituary on Mr Sparks in the Ottawa Journal of March 30 1959 called him the father of the Gatineau Park adding that as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League he brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now the Gatineau Park   
 Born in 1880 where the Supreme Court of Canada stands today Percy Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks He played a leading role in the customs investigation that led to the KingByng Affair and to the subsequent defeat of the Liberal government Mr Sparks contemporaries generally acknowledged him as the parks founder   
 Percy Sparks was a giant who brought down Mackenzie Kings government in 1926 Mr Murray said He was the man who did more to create Gatineau Park than anybody else from lobbying to writing the first master plans   
 Mr Murray said Mr King was cautious about the creation of the park I found an interesting passage in his diary from 1937 a few months before the park was created that showed he wasnt enthusiastic about the park because people might think he was trying to improve his property   
 The NCC says that he was one of the major architects of the park but this disproves it   
 Mr Murray said the NCC never mentioned Mr Sparks role in creating the park so people wouldnt be tempted to advocate it
