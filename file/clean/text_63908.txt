In your edit summary you pointed out that its BRD not BRRR and that is correct  which is why your next step after YOU have made the BOLD edit and I have REVERTED it is to DISCUSS  The next R in that sequence is the first step in an edit war and violates BRD  MY R simplt restores the edit to the status quo ante where it is supposed to be while discussion takes place  YOUR next R which you just did today is again edit warring  you see the problem
