musings 

hey friday

while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages   things like admin etc  they are great

im burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past ive received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me   i also saw that im not the only one whos been on the receiving end of this   ive seen it all but its too long to go into here  im not sure if these are new trends or just something i havent spent the time to look into before  

mere editors really have little recourse in this   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an outofline editor   filing against an admin would i assume be much much worse   admins seem to behave like innercity police with their wall of silence

a lot of your comments show that youve noticed the same happenings  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonablybut i am pessimistic that will happen   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies   we need to define what something like disruption is   when someone is blocked for a personal attack the diff should be included   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change weve tried the trust admins to do what is right   it has failed
