Are you a vigilante when you call the police because your home is being burgled  The Minutemen operate on PRIVATE property with the permission of the property owner  When a tresspasser is found on that property owners land they hold the lawbreaker and call the police  They are not enforcing the law but calling the law enforcement officials  If the Minutemen were operating on public property you would perhaps be correct  But that is not what they are doing
