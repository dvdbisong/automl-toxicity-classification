She is not an undocumented worked as she is not working  It is unfair to punish me with my attempt to include a key fact I have modified it is several different ways in an attempt to compromise but to also make sure this critically important fact is included in the article

I have fairly and accurately stated that she should be listed as an illegal immigrantalien in the history as you initially asked others you twice and Ramsey2006 has done three reverts  Not only to undo my additions but the person with address 68whatever

The fact that biased sources ie people with links to groups involved in the story with an agenda can revert a known fact for political reason completely undermines wikipedia  Know this is the first article I have attempted to edit but this omission is considerable 

Now I am learning as I go I put clear reasons in the history for my change at your request but you have punished me a second time by reverting back

Reasoning

Somebody who crosses the border illegally is an illegal alien

Elvira Arellano is therefore an illegal alien

Elvira Arellano may also be an undocumented worker but so a teenager who does not report baby sitting wages

To list Elvira Arellano as solely and undocumented worker with no reference to her being an illegal immigrantalien is factually negligent

Countless news articles refer to her as such

 
 

Even CNN from this transcript

 

Listen you are the admin you can block me if you want but I hope this is sufficient to have her listed as an illegal immigrantalien  Please let me know what you end up deciding also I am being honest when I state the 68something IP is another individual who had this very same fact edited out and who provided support for it as well
