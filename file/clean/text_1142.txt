One of the things on my wishlist is to automatically create maps and title coordinates using the lat and long fields in the French infobox But thats for later BTW once youve added an infobox you need to check the links in it for instance in the SaintPierredEntremont the link to the arrondissement is broken just fixed it That takes time so Ill finish the stubs first Actually what I do is add the ones others have missed  Talk
