Thank you  If a countrys position on the matter receives significant coverage in highquality secondary sourcing mainstream media and scholarly works it is worth inclusion Its basically the standard for WPWEIGHT Ive been proposing for a while now except that I offered to adhere to a more strict two reliable sources rule I note that what Langus points out is also of relevance to establish the importance of such a section being present in the article
Irondome the source you presented is a good one to give an idea of the weight assigned to the international position on the issue it doesnt mean we should base the entire section on that article or only articles from that source in fact we should not the more articles from reliable sources the better The problem with attempting to come up with a summary like you propose is that it would be very difficult to come to an agreement In this case short mentions of individual or grouped as to avoid listing positions could prove to be less prone to attract neverending discussions
This is what I suggest all in one single section with separated paragraphs

 International position title
 Opening paragraph about the disparity in proArgentinian and proBritish positions being voiced properly sourced and neutral
 UN resolutions briefly mainly The UN does not recognize the islanders as having a right to selfdetermination hence Britain continually rejects the repeated UNs calls for resolving the issue through dialog with Argentina
 Mention of the US and EU neutral positions the Monroe Doctrine should be moved to another part of the article as to not extend the US position too much as major international players The fact that the islands are listed as a British OCT by the EU and the Commonwealth should be mentioned too
 Mention of the majority of Latin American states backing Argentina as per article presented by Irondome the article presented by me and this article accessible here section 31 China should be added here too being another major international player
 Finally Spains position should be mentioned and also its similar issue with Gibraltar although editors have previously opposed any mention of Gibraltar here I still think it is worth of mentioning

Thats my proposal and I am of course open to hear comments andor corrections It should end up being quite shorter than the current section and easier to source too Regards
