References to GNU CGraph 
Long before I wrote the proposed article GNU CGraph I included references under the articles Convolution theorem and Convolution for the benefit of students and their professors teaching and learning about convolution These references were removed by  and  Notwithstanding my belief that GNU CGraph meets the WPNotability criteria  pointed out external links arent required to be WP notable just relevant

Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public The text of the references reads

Under ConvolutionExternal_links
GNU CGraph a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem and displaying signals with their spectral plots

Under Convolution_theoremAdditional_resources
GNU CGraph a free software package for demonstrating the convolution theorem and displaying signals with their spectral plots

No doubt some WPAGF administrator will recognise the educational value and reinstate the references for the benefit of the public
