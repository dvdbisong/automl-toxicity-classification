I am happy to answer this honestly and forthrightly  I am not using two accounts  However it IS true that 4804BT is someone close to me who offered to help resolve some of the issues calmly and is in my office  I beleive the only edits he has made were accompanied by polite requests for approval and done very carefully And has not done anything sine I agreed last night to back out  Nevertheless there is no doubt a CIO violation of some kind  I went in to the office by myself this evening to do some work before leaving town Monday and used the same computer and did not sign in and was surprised to see later that what I wrote was on his account not mine  I immediately reverted them and put them in my name as can be seen in the history   I personally will ONLY use dmartinaus
