Voting history for RI switches 

I reverted the  to the Voting history table because in my opinion it was not appropriate as no vote occurred he was not eligible to be voted against at the time at Tribal Council and he wasnt removed from the game for medical reasons  This RI switch thing could potentially make the Voting history table a mess if a switched person is added in ever time  I think the table should only include actual TC votes or medical removalquits  Similarly the  should only be done when Jeff initiates a switch and the switch is forced

Im bringing this up now so we can discuss how the table should work for future switches if there are any In other words set the precedent now
