Dear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki
When these things become personal they can become petty I dont believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being Wiki doesnt work that way Neither do computers You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships But youll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isnt entirely your own Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations
I was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didnt want to be named I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens Even the memory of their existence would be expunged Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis I dont know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it
 On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters 
The page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila 
Some examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I dont believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue its pure speculation However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust google is very helpful try it For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didnt like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic But because it wasnt done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article 
Unless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing The prime wiki editor of a peoples encylopaedia is people The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they dont need any outside reference to qualify them as experts
But back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others Usually before an interview the press are cautioned not to report any criticism of the Government of Manipur otherwise the privilege given to them will be removed Theres an unspoken threat also that scribes have low life expectancy in Manipur Manipur is like Sri Lanka only
