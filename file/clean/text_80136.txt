notification of discretionary sanctions 

Please note I have imposed an explicit one revert restriction at Silesian language regardless of the content involved  I will also be sanctioning editors who have received this warning who perform more than one revert per day on any article on Wikipedia if the content they remove or add is related to the debate over whether the subject in question should be labelled as the Silesian language or as a dialect  Best
