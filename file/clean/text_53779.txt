In re Neelixs statement above  all of my edits have come from a single device as I assume you can see I was focused on my own edits during the hours spent editing that you mention but I will be vigilant about deleting vandalism going forward The fact that Ive edited sparingly until now doesnt really have any bearing on the issues you bring up and makes none of your accusations more or less likely and certainly provides no evidence for them I assure you that my edits are an attempt to improve the quality of the article and think there is a very good reason to believe that they have been making this article more concise and less repetitious while keeping its most important points and ideas intact
