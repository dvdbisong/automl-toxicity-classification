What to do about the Unchangeable

I just happened upon the article related to the legendary 19th Century Italian tenor MARIO It identifies him as Giuseppe sic Mario

Appart from being an embarrasment this presuposes that Mario had a first name which he didnt not on stage anyway MARIO appeared on stage simply as plain MARIO In any case his private Christian name was NOT Giuseppe but Giovanni His birth name was Giovanni Matteo di Candia This article also calls Giovanni Battista Rubini Alessandro Rubiniobviously whoever set it up had it in for the name John

I would just correct the body of the article but the problem is that up on top that is to say the reference title says Giuseppe Mario which I dont think can be changed

Any suggestions   

 Mario 

Fine but there never was a Giovanni Matteo Mario it was just plain MARIO stage name of Giovanni Matteo di Candia  
Just got your message  we can put him as Mario tenor Is that OK No harm in having multiple redirects  which are created automatically when we move articles  Kleinzach  

I think that would be ideal Thanks Please see my little article on Les Indes galantes and feel free to suggest any improvements

 

Les Indes galantes

I used the schematic template given at your Opera Project site 

Im afraid I dont quite understand we need to write it up rather than leave it in note form Do you mean the synopsis Of course plots of French baroque operas are seminonexistent so they are very hard to detail without boggling the mind Half of the action is allegorical dance anyway

 

If you look at any Encyclopedia under the heading Napoleon you are not going to find the sentence Napoleon was an Emperor of the French which sounds idiotic kind of like Dubarry was a lady but Napoleon emperor of the French 

Similarly If you look up Idomeneo Re di Creta in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera it does not say Idomeneo Re di Creta is an opera in 3 acts by Mozart it actually says Idomeneo Re di Creta Opera in 3 acts by Mozart text by G B Varesco after Danchets libretto for Campras Idomen√©e 1712 and the ancient legend

Not a single little verb in that whole long sentence
