Northland maps 

Hi Gadfium long time no see 

Just noticed a slight problem with the coordinates on the Northland map used for settlements  wondered if you could take a look Dots for places seem to be too far north Panguru is supposed to be on the north coast of the Hokianga Opononi has moved from the south coast to the north and Kaikohe looks like its in the middle of Lake Omapere Presumably the coordinates for the map are set wrong but I dont know how to deal with that Cheers wha
