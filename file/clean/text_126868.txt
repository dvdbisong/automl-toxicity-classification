Im actually taking exception to your calling me cruel things like Delusional because I have a different point of view  Im a new editor and Ive tried to do a good job  From the beginning you did not welcome my discussion my input  You pretended to be helpful but did it in a patronizing manner  Wikipedia has attempted to make editing easier to include less experienced editors  Saying you are experienced is not persuasive in making me feel my viewpoint is less valid than yours  Yes your knowledge of the Wiki system has made it possible for you to remove my goodfaith contributions  And I worked hard and belieive in what I was saying  You chose to only mock me suspend me and belittle me  Ill quit Wikipedia and you will have achieved your goal of not allowing contrary points to be considered  Yes I know you present the charade of a talk page but you tend to bully everyone here who disagrees  Im disheartened because I wanted to add to the discussion but Ive found no fairness or even kindness here  And Im truly sorry for any unkindness on my part but I dont believe I had a chance  You removed my first edits and then gave me a list of Wiki rules  You are a selective rulefollower and even that in spirit only  Following the letter of a rule versus the intent are sometimes two different things  You use the letter of the rule to block opposing views  In reality opposing views should be welcomed and presented But I suppose you will disagree with that put it up to a vote and ban me for saying it  If I hadnt already quit  Take care thank you for any actual give and take and good luck with everything Dan56  I honestly wish you the best because I know you believe you are right
