Sorry to get off on such a bad foot 

While its unfortunate I can only assume that youre slipping into wikistalking as a means to make me feel unwelcome at Wikipedia  Well let me lend you a bit of advice if youre open to hearing it  Instead of just reverting my goodfaith effort to make Wikipedia more reliable then bounding off to some other matter of importance to you it would have been rather easy for you to simply find a proper reference as I did and just fix my egregious error of using Wiktionary to try to correct a citation needed tag  Now do you think we can move forward in harmony or are you really deadset against even my work with MerriamWebster as a source
