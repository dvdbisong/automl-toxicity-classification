Secularity and Secularism are distinct concepts 

Wolfkeeper you redirected Secularity to Secularism however these are two distinct concepts and have seperate entries for that reason  The rationale you stated in your edit summary is not correct as secularity is a noun  Secular is the adjective form as the entry clearly states  If you believe secularity is only appropriate for a Wictionary entry then the correct avenue is AfD since secularlity and secularism are once again not synonymous  Please discuss this matter here on the talk page instead of simply reverting without even an edit summary  Thanks
