 If this article were Fringe it would have been deleted when it was nominated for deletion  From my discussion with JackARoe below about primary vs secondary sources its clear that the rules do not forbid the use of ample primary sources  Your belief that this article if Fringe is just your bias

 Furthermore it does no good for you to make broad statements about the article without getting specific  It is in the specifics that these things are determined  1510 3
