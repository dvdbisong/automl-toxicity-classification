Nyttend I do not understand your reversion of the edits I made on Saddle the type of references I removed are clearly not valid for use on Wikipedia and I confirmed this on the appropriate notice board WikipediaReliable sourcesNoticeboardArchive 123 these edits are clearly not vandalism can you explain your decision to allow these references to remain in use as I am confused here Some of the references seem to be commercial web sites with unreferenced information being used as Wikipedia references this is certainly not appropriate as far as I know thanks
