I also support to move to the philosophy page I would comment further but Yworo has said pretty much everything The statistics are wrong due to the redirect forcing users to go to the operating system first and the operating system along with everything else on the disambig page were named after the philosophy While the OS may be the primary topic for north american and european users you cannot say the same thing for the people of asia or africa or anywhere else in the world Furthermore Yworo is correct Wikipedias guidelines arent written in stone Read WPBURO and WPBATTLE In Canada the Supreme Court ruled in one case that the laws of Canada or any nation arent blackandwhite but rather a series a guidelines for which to abide by leaving room for interpretation and circumstance This is essentially the same for Wikipedia Anyways The primary usage of Wikipedia isnt a search engine such as Google Bing Yahoo it is an encyclopedia And the fact the you would want IPA to direct to a beer is pretty sad of you  talk
