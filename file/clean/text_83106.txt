Underhanded Not at all Ive been entirely forthcoming in this discussion just like I am in all of my discussions I think you may be confusing underhandedness with fairness If you are then you have a point But everyone should have the decency and discretion to keep families out of the discussion For example I never have and will never discuss Gregs family To that extent my discretion is as rock solid To argue that families are somehow fair game would betray a complete lack of integrity IMO
