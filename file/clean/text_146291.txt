Agree  The wording is biased and should be left out  There are other ways to present this material  As the wording stands now it seems like it is POV pushing and making him look as bad as possible  The whole impact leaves one with the impression that this guy has no credibility because hes always been bad  Not true at all  He was a kid nobody wanted and he ended up trying to survive  He wasnt out to hurt anybody  Notice he broke into offices during the night  Not during the day to harm people etcMalke2010
