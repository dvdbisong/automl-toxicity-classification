Superman
Ive seen that its been corrected The Preceeded bys and Followed bys are meant to establish when the films were made not where they fall in continuity If you were to follow that rule all the Indiana Jones movies would be in a different order seeing as they were not sequentially made Superman Returns follows Superman IV but it retcons all events in that movie Just because it retcons it doesnt mean that it doesnt follow it We use this to establish that it was the next movie made in the series not where it falls in the series Thank you
