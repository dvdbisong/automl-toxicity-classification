This episode seems to have been started by a good faith intention to protect WPs reputation WPs reputation is that it is an unreliable source There is no reason for us to wish to change this reputation as WP is proud to be an openly unreliable source attempting to become more reliable rather than a source which claims reliability and then always fails to live up to this promise
