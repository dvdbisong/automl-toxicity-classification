Ok  I understand  the unsourced part is the dates  Is it considered unsourced if I copied the dates directly off another Wikipedia page the Solomon and Jehoshaphat pages to be exact  This is why I included the Wikipedia links on their names  Or do you guys not want circular thinking  Either is fine just trying to crack the nut
