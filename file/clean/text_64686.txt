Aklauncher I feel sad because Wikipedia doesnt have an article about The Beta Adrenergic Theory thats been cited much more than the Hygiene Hypothasis  I would be most gratful if you would write about The Beta Adrenergic Theory based partly on the subarticle under Asthma
My dad Andor Szentivanyi discovered it and its been cited by such famous people as Craig Venter The Human Genome Project and Charles Reed Chief of Allergy The Mayo Clinic
