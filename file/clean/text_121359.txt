Kentucky film 1938 

Howdy

I am confused

I was reading your plot entry for Kentucky film

In the first paragraph you put During the Civil War Thad Goodwin Charles Waldron of Elmtree Farm a local horse breeder resists Capt John Dillon Douglass Dumbrille and a company of Union soldiers confiscating his prize horses He is killed by Dillon and his youngest son Peter Bobs Watson cries at the soldiers riding away with the horsesHe implies Thad Goodwin

Then in the second paragraph you putThad Goodwin dies when his speculation on cotton drops 75 years later

How is this possible 

Is this a Heaven Can Wait type plot
