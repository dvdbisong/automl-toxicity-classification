Then what is it that you are trying to do You want others to weigh in on  and convince them that the editor should be allowed to participate no you want someone to invite the user back to editing SP FC and you would like everyone to ignore the rhetoric it has placed upon the users talk page all about me I have also seen that you would like them to discipline me in some manner for not being nice to the user when the user was using the FC talk page to broadcast perceived problems to the readers of the SP so I find your claim of no ill will with guarded concern The publication is now a week ahead of publishing times and not one person out of the 600000 readers a month has had a single comment that was not positive about my efforts  It seems to me but I could be wrong as I am not perfect that you are only contributing to this drama by reaching out to uninvolved editors and dragging them into this with poor Hafs please help bi annual drama I think the meatball page is a accurate portrayal of this type of conduct I think if the user removes the overwhelming amount of attack info it has on its talk page that your efforts might be taken more seriously Cheers talk
