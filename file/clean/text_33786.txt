AfD warning 

It looks as if other people trying to show you were you are going wrong havent had any success so Ill make it clear if you continue to nominate articles for deletion which are about notable subjects as established after spending some effort on Google searches you will be blocked 

Not every AfD needs to be successful many of my AfDs end in keep or no consensus But starting an AfD for lack of notability without doing any effort to find sources yourself is against policies and guidelines and continuing to do so after it has been explained to you is disruptive Speedy deletion criteria have nothing to do with this and dont apply to films and so on anyway but note that eg a record can only be speedy deleted if the musician or band are a redlink similarly we wouldnt speedy delete a film article where the main actors are bluelinks even if we had a speedy criterion for films
