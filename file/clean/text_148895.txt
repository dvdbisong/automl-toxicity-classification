I know a cite for the Coolac Massacre

Last monday at around 10am on ABC Radio666 Canberra Morning Show presented by Alix Sloane Alix had Ian Warden UC as a guest  They had a phone in re Australian values and aussie trivia  The show went right across NSW  During it it was said that the Coolac Massacre happened  The tape of the show should be available  I am sure Alix would oblige
