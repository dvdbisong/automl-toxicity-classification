I also think that this article should show or describe what atheists do  that is in regard to being atheists not other social roles fatherhusband employee etc along with what they think
For example i can say that Muslims go to mosques pray beat up their wives blow up etc  what do atheists do
Also there should be some words about the persecution of atheists in certain countries  most notably the denial of rights to become members of legislature in some US statesby those states Constitutions
Thirdly  i saw some quotes or notes being taken from several UK sources is that NPOV considering UK is still a theocracy  technicallyhead of state is also head of state church 8612316847
