Casa By The Sea page 

Your speedy delete of that page was unwarranted You said POV problem for example what if there was a criminal orginazation and there is a wealth of info about there crimes What if there is little to no info in defense of them Does that mean that they are not fairly treated if theres a page on them and that there crimes and they them selfs dont deserve a place in history because they dont have enough info to defend them If thats the case I dont understand how there could be a Nazi page
