Help ImageTaggingBot trashed licenced images  

How do I keep the ImageTaggingBot from trashing work 

I created the following images and I included the correct copyright information but the ImageTaggingBot trashed the links 

FilePulsedoppler ambiguity zonespng
FilePulse doppler signal processingpng 
FileWaveguidepng

I dont want to put the images back because I will just be fighting with a piece of software 

What has to be done to stop software from automatically trashing things 

I hope this finds everyone well 

Best regards 
Greg Wilson
