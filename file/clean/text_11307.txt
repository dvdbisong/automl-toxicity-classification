Thank you Mainly because of the R H Blyths overemphasis of the relationship between haiku and Zen Buddhism in his books on haiku and the influence of those books on other authors on both haiku and Zen Buddhism many Westerners have misguided ideas about haiku The haiku article should probably have a separate section giving a more accurate description of the connections that do exist but that article has so many other problems I havent had the time to do the research to do a proper rewrite and restructuring of that article Verse
