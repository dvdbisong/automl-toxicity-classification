I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous  We are never obliged to use the same words as any source  You can find a source claiming that almost anything is famous  its hardly a rare case where lots of sources do so  so should we describe everything as famous  No I tried that and it was rightly shot down  You can find a source  a famous one  which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker  And those words arent even listed as ones to avoid so do we use them as if they are objectively true  Obviously not
I dont believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia I already said that  But we have a guideline called words to avoid  It doesnt say avoid these words unless you really want to use them it doesnt say avoid these words unless you see them in external sources it says avoid these words because they neither impart nor summarise verifiable information  The guideline is very long established and I see no sensible case for an exception here  20083101199
