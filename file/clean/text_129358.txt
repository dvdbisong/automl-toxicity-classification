I dont want to put a stick into anyones spokes but I think incremental improvements of this article is a mistake while it is structured to be ForAgainst the No Massacre Thesis That structure is a roadblock that will stop us ever getting a sensible article Restructure first then do the lead then tighten up on the rest of it However Im very happy with the work done by GDett and Eleland and commend their new lead which incidentally would be something like what we decided we needed some weeks ago in one of the sections started by Jaakobou
PS  Ive reindented this section into the threaded form I believe it should have This is not an exercise in disruption Ive even left the comment contribution in its original confused state its because Im pretty sure it makes it much more sensible and easier to read
