Hey there Welcome to Wikipedia Sorry that I didnt respond earlier I just noticed your comment here tucked beneath the box above An easier way to get another persons attention is to make sure to create a new section when you add new posts on talk pages Then we can have a bit better control of the conversation And dont forget to sign your comments too Please feel free to keep my name in your back pocket if you ever have a question or just need help navigating the policies and guidelines of the community While it may all seem intimidating at first just make sure to engage in conversation with others and carefully read any information posted on your talk page along with the links provided Most people are truly here to help so dont hesitate to reach out and ask when you have questions And remember to have fun Happy editing and Happy New Year Best regards  amuse Cindy
