As noted in the article its an IBA Official Cocktail and the IBA calls it an OLD FASHIONED That may not help with the capitalization question but it does say something about the dash  Also please note that the WPDASH style guide says that a dash is used to create a compound modifier a compound adjective or compound adverb but not a compound noun Here I believe Old Fashioned is a noun As for the capitalization I think that Old fashioned appears too much like an adjective rather than a proper name This page is about a specific named drink so I think the capitalization is appropriate
