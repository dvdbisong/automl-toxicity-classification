Its true that I didnt formally add myself to the list at RfArPseudoscience Ive only looked at one other arbitration last year and I forget if I said anything But of course I was involved at RfArPsuedoscience where you made your presence obviously noticeable So I now act as a somewhat interested party not trying to take charge as an administrator  indeed I was approved as an administrator with the idea I would only use my administrator powers on the main page for now As for the punctilious neutrality that would be expected of such an administrator Im pretty sure you arent the example of it
