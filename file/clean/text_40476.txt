Alaeddin Keykubad 
Hi Angus Do you think it would be a good idea to open a new proposal for the articles on the three Seljuk sultans named Alaeddin Keykubad to be titled under their correct form You had brought in your interventions in a macrocosmical manner during the last two caucuses which is why I am seeking your opinion before else If you check Alanya article on wikipedia main page today you will see that the name is rendered as Alaeddin Keykubad for the first and foremost one To add an opinionated note I am expecting little initiative from my fellow Turks on putting the name of an old sultan in correct form ruminating cattle as many are All at the same time as holding rather heterodox stances it had fallen on me to defend the article on the mosque too Anyway I can arrested for writing stuff like this bozkır cengâverlerinin pimpirikli torunları I should have said if you understood Turkish it can not be translated  

SO in the future Id rather refrain from triggering dynamics that are alien to me and whose consequences remain largely unknown I am distancing myself from my subject I intend to put forth a new request for renaming in a short while Regards
