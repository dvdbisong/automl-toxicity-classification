The Church of Scientology is hardly a Church at all
Direct or Indirect oppression against those who disagree with the church or publicly speak out against their practices and beliefs is Not sure about most countries but im sure it is in Aus illegal

HOWEVER it is not wikipedias job to refuse an article to a cult There is insufficent references and third party information regarding the church of scientologys article
All of its sources are from either its own publications or publications by its members and affilate orginiazations 

Either Deletion or some other form of action should be taken on this article
The article is full of lies half truths self promotion and defamation of the group anonymous Last i checked Wiki articles were supposed to be netural
