Well I cannot respond to this over at deletion review but I think this comment speaks for itself and shows the kind of mindset I am dealing with 
But the Silver medal which is the award in this case is a person under the age of 40 who is actively engaged in research and has by way of international participation and publications shown outstanding capability and achievement I do not think that confers notability  I see the key phrase outstanding capability which often means Not Yet Notable Its possible that an article directed to the scientific achievements might meet the standard but it would need to be written by someone else
To say that outstanding capability and achievement is not notable is frankly mindboggling to say the least  I am just glad to be out of this mental asylum for now
