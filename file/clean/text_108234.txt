Im afraid you dont understand Since the image did not come with any copyright license restrictions I uploaded the image for research purposes and it was never intended to be used on Wikipedia If you do want anyone to use your images you should specify so and stop posting them on public forums where anyone can link to them take them and use them without your permission Any more Wikipedia policies you want to flaunt around Go right ahead I find it very amusing Of course your ceaseless bickering on my userpage is probably due to the embarrassing full exposure I made against you on the Evidence Page for ArbCom  talkemail 1941
