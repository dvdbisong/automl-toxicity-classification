This article needs reliable sources 
Some of Wikipedias best articles have significant contributions from family historians and genealogists their expertise is critical to getting Wikipedia to expand beyond its current areas of emphasis  But articles need references and citations from reputable sources  Usercreated websites such as homesteadcom are not reliable  Please cite census records published works excluding those from vanity presses etc  Thanks  72244204154
