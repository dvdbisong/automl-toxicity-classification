Haywards Heath Town Ladies Football Club  

Hi  I am baffled  as to why my submission is not acceptable   if you search for  HAYWARDS HEATH   you will find an entry for Haywards Heath Town Football Club  so is it just because we are a womens football Club    Also if you search for Hassocks you will see a lenghty entry for Hassocks FC which includes mention of a ladies section 

With us being the 2nd oldest Womens football Club in the whole of Sussex  surely that is Notable    however  I can add   that we  received the Sussex County FA  Charter Standard Club award  for 3 seasons running   20078 20089 and 200910  seasons  the ONLY womens Club in Sussex to have received the award   surely that is Notable verifyable on the Sussex County FA website already mentioned 

I await your response with fingers crossed
