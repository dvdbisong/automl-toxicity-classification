I would simply do away with that list if you are to ask me However if it is to stay I have to say no Because those people are Romanian citizens from the moment Romania existed just wait until it gets to point out its paradoxes and then perhaps Ill be supported in removing it You missed the point this does not group people by by ethnicity or citizenship but by where they were born That region is now in Romania and as I have pointed out wikipedia disregards past sovereignties  not for the sake of jingoism but for the sake of simplicity and logic You could only accuse me of something if I were to go and remove people listed here from their Hungarian something categories or their mention on List of Hungarians
