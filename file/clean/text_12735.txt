PS Having served my time possibly deservedly but Im not the only culprit here I think I will not bother Nobody as Medeis is appropriately supposed to mean for the time being But I cant help but commenting on the following Lets hope he reads this

It was immensely funny to see that the first message on his talk page after my last one was an Edit Warring warning Of course being Medeis he deleted that from his page

I must say for someone as innocent as he pretends to be he shouldnt have to polish his public face as he has done more than once Out of sight out of mind right

This is not a promise never to post anything on his page again so if and when I do youll have to find another reason And if and when I do Ill be more subtle Although I still stand by my opinion that he hasnt got the faintest idea of what he was talking about

Best of wishes
