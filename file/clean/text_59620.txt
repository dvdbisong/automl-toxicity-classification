I had seen that site previously but cannot find any map from any of the archaeological institutions that would show more accuracy or even back up their claims I have run out of ideas where to go to find the info or even a map showing anything like thier representations
The problem is that most geological maps tend to not include sea levels there were no maps made at the time and I cannot find any Roman period texts that describe the area yet
There is mention of Pytheas sailing around the coast in 350 BC or so but I cannot find that either lol
Ah well  I wil keep trying
