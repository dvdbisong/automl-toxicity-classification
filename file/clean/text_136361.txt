 Criticism Section  Not Clutch 

This section is basically about how Arod is not considered to be clutch The section is outdated and irrelevant due to his performance in the 2009 playoffs No one debates whether or not he is clutch anymore This entire section should be deleted Does anyone disagree   talk  contribs  
Im thinking about this  Some of it could be kept if put in a historical perspective  But it is clearly over the top as it is   
I just reread this section and its completely outdated I still think it should be removed in its entirety   
Some of it needs to be kept  Lets discuss what should stay and what should go  Im totally okay with reducing the size of it but it needs to be mentioned   
I made some dramatic changes to the section trying to shorten it and update it  Also Ive tried to reorganize the section as it had obviously grown organically over a long period  My efforts are by no means stellar and I suggest people look at the section with new eyes to see how to further improve it  
It is at the least a good start  Thank you  Ill take a closer look at it later   
Nice updates The section seems relevant again   
I made some minor copyedits to the section I think the section ought to stay included  its part of Arods historical record that hes come under fire for being unclutch ludicrous as those criticisms may have been Im also going to remove the tag suggesting integrating the section elsewhere  the section hardly gives undue weight to the controversy which extended over a period of several years and occupied whoknowshowmany back pages in the sports press bomb 

 Range Factor 

The range factor claims currently tagged as as citation needed can be verified on ESPNs page and probably elsewhere The claims as stated are accurate and verifiable Id add the cite but on second thought I question whether its really a useful thing to state It makes it sound like thats the final word on his defense which it surely isnt Range factor isnt the only defensive stat and ARod does not rank last on many of the others To cite it exclusively feels like youre trying to push a point of view criticizing him defensively Also even on range factor in 2004 and 2005 he was tied for last not alone   

 Youngest to hit 600 

This stat is misleading while he may be the youngest to achieve this he took an above average time to do so He played 183 more games than Babe Ruth Because Rodriguez started playing baseball at a much earlier age than many of the greats should be noted He is a good player but statements concerning his age should be taken out Games playedSeasons are a better barometer of talent than age  Preceding unsigned comment added by 1701234230
