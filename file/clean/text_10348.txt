Human Rights Abuses 

I understand that many of the people who write here are probably against the war and use the human rights abuse section to list all the bad things that the American military has done But something that should be added to that is all the American soldiers who have been taken prisoner killed tortured mutilated etc Damn right thats a human rights abuse I dont know much about it myself or I would write but anyone else who does please do so
