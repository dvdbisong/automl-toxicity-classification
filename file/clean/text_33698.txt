Trisquel

Thanks for your contribution to this article but by longstanding consensus operating systems that use the Linux kernel are called Linux on Wikipedia as per WPCOMMONNAME GNULinux is considered a minority POV term used by the FSF and its supporters On Wikipedia the term is only used to describe distros when the distro itself is called GNULinux and then only when referring to the distro itself If you want to change this consensus then the way to go about is not by trying to insert the term GNULinux into articles on distributions such as on Trisquel You should read TalkLinux including all the archives of that page to get the history of the problem as well as TalkLinuxName as this is where past consensuses have been formed You will also want to read GNULinux naming controversy and its talk page as background as well When you have the history of the consensus read then you can present your case at TalkLinux to try to convince the other editors that all references Linux other than to the kernel itself in Wikipedia should be changed to GNULinux Be advised that this has been brought up dozens of times there including recently and has always been soundly and conclusively opposed
