Secular vs Religious 

I need help

Neutrality  How do you add secularism to word God and to word martyr  These words can not be secular 

Word martyr is in many religious texts as we can see in the contents section now just because someone decided to name some people martyrs in some event that happened in time who didnt even die or that did die doesnt make them martyrs even though we call them 

Now this word is used by secular people the word God is used by secular people when they say that God is someone else other than God  This is the same problem with this word

I need help with these trigger happy undo button pushers suggested by automated program that counts bytes

The word martyr means witness yes but we do not mean a witness in court here   we mean a witness in religious terms here so there is no room for secularism on this page just as there is no room for athiests on religious pages and religious people on atheists beliefs pages
