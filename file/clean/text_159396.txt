Israeli historian Ilan Papp√© wrote a book called The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine If I tried to cite the title of the book as a source for adding Palestine was ethnically cleansed to an article I would be rightly laughed off the page and probably sanctioned Your proposal is no different please quote what you want to use from Hoskings book and what edit you wish to support with this Otherwise stop prevaricating and go elsewhere
