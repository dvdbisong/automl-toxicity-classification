FYI Entomology 

ShaneKing I applaud your contribution to the discussion at Atheism but would like to point out a small issue that may be purposeful on your behalf or may be a typo Entomology is the scientific study of insects whereas Etymology is the study of the origins of words I am pointing this out to you as information only Best regards  2307 25 Oct 2004 UTC
