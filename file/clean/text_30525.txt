I dont have a problem with that quote being included as long as its presented in that context ie a quote by an organisation but with a couple of caveats  it follows the Ronnie OSullivan format where only his achievements are presented in the introductory paragraph and his standing in the game is included in the second paragraph  Also if we are using worldsnooker profiles as the criteria OSullivans should be updated to say he is snookers most naturally gifted player
