titleGaleriusdiffprevoldid40940009 removed interwiki links for various languages which I dont believe you intended so Ive reverted it  When making your edits please edit only the section you actually wish to change presumably the worms section   

Its happened to me before you click on an earlier version in the articles history and then later you start editing it not remembering that its not the latest version  In this case your edit resembled that of Brambo from September 24 so perhaps you followed links and ended up editing the older version

Atlanterhavsveien
Sorry I forgot to log in when editing that page Id stick with both points of my edits though  Wikipedia definitely doesnt use  as the decimal separator even on Continental European articles or when working in kilometres Secondly its a road not a bridge However it is a road that has a lot of bridges on it  a good analogy is the Overseas Highway in the Florida Keys For now Id be happy to leave it in the bridge section I dont understand why you reverted the inclusion of CategoryRoads in Norway  I mean it is a road and its in Norway right  
No worries apology appreciated  It looks like you do a lot of good work here thanks

I do not know how far you up to date with the conflict that is keeping editors from editing the page If not I suggest you have a look at the arbitration case that is currently pending  

To facilitate this was the version most people except Marcosantezana could live with

Natural selection is the process in which individual organisms that possess favourable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce  Natural selection works on the phenotype the outward form determined by genes the genotype the environment and the interaction between them Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes such as mutations and recombinations and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection Natural selection together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations is an important component of evolution a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research

The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book The Origin of Species as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock which Darwin called artificial selection
