Correction re cast iron 

I want to tell you personally just in case you missed looking at the ref desk that I was WRONG re the point where a binary ironcarbon system goes from ironcementite to irongraphite  I said the transition point is at about 2 carbon but in fact it NEVER transitions to irongraphite unless silicon is added as an alloying element  My apologies 24512213
