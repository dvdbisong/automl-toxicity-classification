Dont throw your weight around please I am not a single issue campaigner I happen to be interested in 19th century church music as it happens Do you not think that it would be kind to respect Mendelssohn seniors wishe on this matter He wished to abandon Judaism Should he not be allowed to do so Felix Mendelssohn was very ostensibly a Christian composer who wrote a great deal of church music much of which is used liturgically today If he was a convert like Mahler then it might be reasonable to categorise him as Jewish in that he would have been Jewish for part of his life However he was not He was baptised as a Christian having been born to Christian parents If you would like to categorise him as a Jew would you allow me to categorise Mr Obama as a Muslim in that he has a Muslim name and had Muslim grandparents If the matter is controversial it should not be there You are also WRONG about Grove
