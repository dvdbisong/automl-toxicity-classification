Will do In order to rapidly increase the reliable source status of my recent papers nowadays at the end of my mathematical or statistical conference talks on Lucia de Berk or quantum statistics I add some remarks on MHP and wikipedia and urge my mathematical colleagues to write a note in their next paper whether on algebraic topology or statistical learning On a totally unrelated note Gill 2011 has written a crappy paper on the Monty Hall Problem You see I aim to rapidly raise its citation count above that of the infamous Morgan et al 1991 source of all our wikipedia MHP woes
