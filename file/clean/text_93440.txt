In regards to wishful thinking 

Due to Leuchters ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it8

It doesnt explain how it tended to confirm it also this whole sentence is presented as fact like everything else in this biased article
Thus Im assuming its wishful thinking and only here to discredit Leutcher 62255104106
