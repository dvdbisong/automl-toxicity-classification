Ahh yes By Mormons in this instance I do mean members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints I can see how youd read that section in this way Perhaps we can clarify  what do you suggest It is not that the doctrines changed but rather that what Smith emphasized changed What is and what is not church doctrine is a fuzzy thing and as you likely know has always been the case Many things that church members believe to be doctrine is not but cultural doctrines promulgated by church members In any case the teachings of Smith and what he emphasized are fuzzy enough that many people thought his earlier teachings were more accurate or that he changed doctrines or that the current church misunderstood his teachings on many matters We have to balance this to be historically accurate with what is believed and taught today Not an easy task Im open to suggestions in how to change wording Lets discus here and then make the changes Suggestions Also Id invite you to join wikipedia We always need newcomers Registration is easy
