With regard to Middletown Connecticut your removal of the Neutrality tag constitutes conflict of interest as your IP address is a state website If you would like to dispute the tag please open a discussion on the talk page for the article Otehrwise youll end up on the Wiki list of organizations agencies that self edita pretty embarassing place to be   

This is where he was engaged in further activity to intimidate a poster
Also interesting is a history of edits from user at the Connecticut gov Middletown gov state IP address and a seemingly related Wesleyan Univeristy IP Pgagnon999 talk  

This vicious and underhanded behavior is threatening and abusive 

He does not engage in civil behavior he deletes QUOTED material and then posts garbage from lame sites that support his narrow and partisan beliefs Thats nasty behavior And astonishing to me that you support him in it

Hes pushing point of view hes violated neutrality hes deleted referenced material hes certainly does not assume good faith I mean hes out there attacking people and all but terrorizing them And thats the guy youve put your support behind Great
