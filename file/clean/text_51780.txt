Btw in his latest revert OlYeller falsely claimed Reasons have been presented on the talk page and you refuse to discuss  The sentence in question the one that OlYeller keeps deleting was in the Pakistan Internet block section and that sentence that I added has NOT been discussed on the talk page  In fact that entire section has not been discussed on the talk page  Its true that Pakistan has been mentioned on the talk page but that was in the context of modifying the first sentence of the article and had NOTHING to do with the new sentence in the Pakistan Internet block section  So OlYeller has not only engaged in multiple reversions within 24 hours but is claiming to do so under false pretenses
