Based on

Hello Rigadoun your query raises a puzzle for which I would welcome your input

Im sure we agree that editing without a reference source is a terrible idea and articles should have lots and lots of inline references to indicate where all the material came from

But what if all the material comes from one single reference source  In such a case I could in principle add a footnote to every sentence which would cite the very same source  But this seems a little bit inelegant and readerunfriendly to me  I felt it better simply to declare once and for all that everything in the article came from the same source  Yours sincerely   

Josef Friedrich Anton Fleischmann
