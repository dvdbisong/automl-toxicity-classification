I would suggest that is is you that needs to work within the framework of wiki rules AUFORN vufors  and pra do not have a seperate entry in wikipedia So with your line of reasoning are you suggesting that vufors and pra entries be promptly deleted from the Aust UFOlogy article if the answer is no you dont want them removed from the article then AUFORN legitimately belongs there  So this matter is closed unless you have another line of reasoning you would like to share with us as to why AUFORN should not be in the article
