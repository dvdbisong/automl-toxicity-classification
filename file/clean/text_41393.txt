As of December 29 2006 this technique is disabled on this wiki The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates Note that this only disables use of the CSS class hiddenStructure It does not prevent use of similar tags like display none or visibility hidden

Why do I think Its a shame this article is written like garbage It occupies the first spot in the search results People actually do access Wikipedia for medical informationThe article is not only poorly written as regards to formatting syntax lack of images etc it also contains example after useless example of ADHD is contoversial nonsense That does a disservice to people with the disorder Referencing a 2001 television program about the ADHD controversy or including the views of Tom Cruise does nothing except to place doubts unwarranted ones in peoples minds
