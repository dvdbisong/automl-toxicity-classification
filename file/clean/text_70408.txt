According to the Airlinersnet description of the CRJ100 and 200 The original CRJ100 series  the 100 100ER and 100LR  was augmented by the 200 series with more efficient engines in 1995  This particular aircraft was manufactured six years after the switchover  The confusion is because this flight was usually operated by a CRJ100 but since seating is the same they can often be substituted for one another
