Notability 

WPNOTE requires that a topic have coverage in reliable third party sources independant of the subject to be considered notable  As of yet I dont find this to be the case with this article  Please not that I am not saying that DragonRealms is not notable only that there is no statement as to why it is notable in the article and no sources to demonstrate this notability  At the moment the only section that is properly sourced is the section on the Hoax which indicates that the Hoax might be notable but not the game itself
