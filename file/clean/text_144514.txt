That is not being ignorant it is knowing enough about music as an art form to make an informed decision about what has a constructive rather than a destructive effect on the hearer and what is timeless art rather than a disposable product made with very little actual musical knowledge or skill That is coming from an understanding of music and what makes art and what could be considered technique from the Greek for art or style If you are capable of making an actual ARGUMENT for artstic merit in these styles without resorting to the blas√© antielitist OPINION if you can make an actual argument for technical skill and learning comparable to what is expected of classical musicians something YOU might not be informed about or a compositional analysis that shows the artistic merit of this music or some empirical neurological evidence that it is healthy for you because really it is NOT as all the most informed ancient cultures already understood thousands of years ago PLEASE lets hear an actual intelligent argument rather than namecalling Do inform me
