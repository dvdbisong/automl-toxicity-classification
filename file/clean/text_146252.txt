Response to block on 2009February12

Tattletelling
 My talk page history shows that a talkback was placed on my page on 1326 for  a comment that was posted on 1325 This shows that  manually placed the talkback in my talk page in order to call attention He certainly doesnt want to make friends with me so who is supposed to see it

The block was enacted in haste
 My block log shows that the block was enacted at 1408 whereas the complaint was posted to  WPWQA at 1446 Why would someone respond to a request from the future 

Complaint to WPWQA
Initial complaint
This may have been forum shopping in response to a seemingly ignored plea This is also about SarekOfVulcans statements which show bad faith overall Blocking me first and then posting the complaint would amount to censorship since I would only be able to refute the claims in my talk page and through unblock requests This risks my being blocked from my own talk page

From  oldid270227244

lots of civility violations
Starts off using hyperbole

Id honestly like him to settle down and become a productive member of Wikipedia
False statement he worked diligently to get me blocked Lack of useful contributions cited as a reason for blocking which is also false

if we cant defend our arguments against determined opposition are they really any good
Vague statement I have agreed on some points in the talk page while many others have gone undisputed The other users seem to disagree with everything I say Whatever is not disagreed never gets a response

I see him getting indefblocked within the month Can somebody  point him in the right direction Make sure you read all of the discussion so he cant accuse you of only reading the scandalous parts
Defamation

has called other editors liars
A false inference

appealed a block on the grounds that essentially the Masons made Elonka block him
Another false inference He has cited unrelated sysop actions not involving him in unusual detail which shows malice or at the least stalking

Last night I noticed that he had added a bunch of references to Daigo Umehara that included exlinks in the authorlink field so I cleaned them up removing only the authorlinks 
I never asked for his help and he never suggested the change to me TemplateCite web doesnt say that its prohibited simply that it doesnt work which is usually OK This means that his changes were not in good faith He admits to following me to a page that I was working on to do nothing but remove links This is a form of harassment

Additions to the WQA complaint
In  oldid270230275 he added
Previous discussion here at archive 57SarekOfVulcan talk 
which was a discussion irrelevant to the current situation

Deletion of the WQA complaint
In  he saw it fit to completely delete the request stating blocked for two weeks no action needed

From 
Was that in response to my WQA filed involving those two diffs If not Ill just remove it before anyone comments
This is evidence tampering Deleting it would be sensible if one argues that his post is not even evidence

In addition he has described my posting to WPANI as amusing in  Blueboars talk page and  MSJapans talk page

The article in question
Masonic conspiracy theories
It is part of the Freemasonry Wikiproject and all of the editors are Freemasons They have created a cabal to stop me from making what I believe to be neutral edits Initially they have countered that the article as it stood was even more neutral but have since rescinded from that position and have taken to changing the article suddenly after 5 months without a single edit So much for a consensus and so much for the article being neutral

Many of my talking points remain undisputed and have caused the other users to resort to
