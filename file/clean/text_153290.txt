Why the financial models dont work 

For the four people who are interested I had a theory a few years back on bifurcating debtcreated normal curves where towards the end of any Ponzilike Hyman Minskystyle debtcreated bubble the expected returns bifurcate into two SEPARATE normal curves either high positive or high negative ie hyperinflation or strong deflation  It went nowhere because I was considered insane by those who took the time to listen to me  Now it doesnt seem so crazy  Has anyone seen anything published or reviewed in the academic literature other than Minsky that has considered this bifurcating dynamic
