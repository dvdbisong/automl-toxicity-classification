Heres why there was no consensus looking at the move discussion although I cannot read the mind of the admin who closed the discussion and can only assume based on general Wikipedia guidelines  said support

Therefore you just have the nominator then a user who said oppose and only one user that said support And since voting is not a substitute for discussion there was not enough users and opinions to determine a true consensus Therefore I recommend that you proceed with another post at WikipediaRequested moves Thanks
