Where did they go 

While Malcolm does flee to England Donalbain heads off to Ireland and not to England with Malcolm as the article suggested

MALCOLM 
What will you do Lets not consort with them
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy Ill to England

DONALBAIN 
To Ireland I our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer where we are
Theres daggers in mens smiles the near in blood
The nearer bloody
