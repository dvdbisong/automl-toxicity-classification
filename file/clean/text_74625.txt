The first issue here is use of use of the word revealed religion which was completely well sourced but you have reverted and again you have also done some massive modifications without any consensus at all to show some two theories Your whole argument is based on one sentence from one source while I would provide several references below But before that your one source does not even contradict it being a revelation 

From your own one source

Page 78 Guru Gobind Singhs work is best understood as the fulfillment of Guru Nanaks revelation The Sikh organization had taken on the semblance of a State during

So your own source is describing it as Guru Nanaks revelation Now my addition was wellsourced and I can add here tens of other sources But I believe at this point there is no need to even share them since your own source agrees with revelation 

Next you keep quoting the sentence on not being Prophet but illumined soul As per your own definition Prophet is one who utters divinely inspired revelations believed to have come from God In this sense since your own source says revelations it is completely fringe and weak to consider even the nonProphet aspect as reliable Especially when there are 10s of other reliable sources that also use the words revelations and Prophets And further again even in your own source when describing Guru the author quotes

On account of his divine prerogative and attributes the Guru though human in form is godly in spirit God speaks to humanity through him God enlightens the seekers of truth through him and his word

The author also states Guru Gobind Singh tells Bhai Nand Lal  Guru is the Light which is eternally God and represents Gods Being in pure form It is because of the consummate perfection that God is in the Guru and the Guru is in God 

So I have not even brought it any of the other 10s of sources and your own single source is so weak and on the contrary it actually supports revelations God is in the Guru God speaks to humanity through him As I had said before it is you who needs to get consensus before your massive unexplained edits that you keep performing 

And finally as a general advice the fact that Sikhs consider the Gurus to be direct messengers sent by God and the Guru Granth Sahib to be the word of God is one of the most  basic and fundamental beliefs in Sikhism I am surprised you are not aware of such a basic and fundamental aspect
