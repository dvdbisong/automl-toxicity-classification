Psychopaths
Sorry Yobol while I believe that nonpredatory psychopaths should be entitled to the same rights as everyone else it is clear that you do not fall into that category  You targeted me and turnabout is fair play   Your potential future victims have the right to be warned

Contrary to what you and your esteemed colleges would have your prey believe psychopathy is a common disorder  We know what causes it and we have made significant inroads in treatment  Med school does not screen psychopaths out  It screens them in

If you dont want to end up as MastCells prison bh  I suggest you spend less time perusing future victims and more time perusing treatment
