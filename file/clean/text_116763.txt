What on earth are you talking about  Regarding the following quote of mine Even if the officer was unaware of the convenience store robbery Brown himself was certainly aware of it  Furthermore Brown did not know that the officer was unaware of it  Yes that is exactly what I stated  I never said that that quote of mine needs to be placed in the article  Nor did I state that the substance of that quote needs to be placed in the article  That quote was used as my rationale in arriving at my conclusion that the robbery is germane to the article  Whether or not the robbery is germane to the article is the exact topic of this Talk Page thread  So stop accusing people ie me of inappropriate conduct   Thats twice now  I am doing exactly what this Talk Page is intended for  Dont tell me what quotes and what topics and what content I can or cannot use in supporting my arguments  Also stop putting words in peoples ie my mouth  If it continues I am taking further action   Thanks
