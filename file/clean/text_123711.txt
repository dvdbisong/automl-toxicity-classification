Also in the differences section more specifically the differences between the first gen and second gen touch I it should be mentioned that the 2nd gen has improved audio quality thanks to a new DAC This is a pretty important difference because some people didnt buy a 1st gen solely because of the audio quality which was just average The 2nd gen in comparision has very high audio quality ratings see PC World review thanks to the DAC change and is supposed to be one of the best sounding players on the market 1283646242
