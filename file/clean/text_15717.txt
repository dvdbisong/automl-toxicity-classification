Im touched by your faith in the accuracy of directors dates of birth as recorded by Companies House IME an article by some journalist is of equal reliability to the records of Companies House Im not going to revert your change again but I suspect that others may do so Remember its not our place to determine what is correct when there is doubt as to a validity of a fact  we should cite both sources and let the reader determine which one they trust more YMMV
