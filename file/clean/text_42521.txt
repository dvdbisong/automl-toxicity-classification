Robert Conrad 

Frank Ive reversed your deletion in the Robert Conrad entry for his friendship with mafia hitmanmurderer Tony Spilotro  You deleted because it was uncited  All you had to do was go to Google and Google  Robert Conrad Spilotro  and it is the very first entry  in an interview he gave  Its quite well known  You didnt even bother to do even a minimum of research  I notice this a lot in Wikipedia  people deleting things they know nothing about on subjects they know nothing about and not bothering to do any research  For the record I dont delete or even modify anything if I do not know the subject matter quite well  I dont know why you edited this out  you obviously know very little about Robert Conrad  Anyway Ive put it back in with the very first link I found which was the very first entry that comes up on Google when you put in both their names  Duh
