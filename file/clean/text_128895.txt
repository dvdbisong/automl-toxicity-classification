I have done dozens of useful edits on Etty including a few just today You seem to be completely oblivious to WPGood faith I did an edit awhile back on another of your articles moved a picture as I recall and got a similar rude summary comment from you Not more than 10 minutes later a total stranger emailed me to apologize for your rudeness The person said Its only Wikipedia just ignore it  I only try to help articles never to damage them It would be nicer if you simply changed edits that you dont like rather than do a vicious reversion with a snide remark
