Translation of the name 

Should the name really be translated into English For example on the Catalan wikipedia would one talk about for example Plaid Cymru or el Partit de Galles Would one talk about lUMP Union pour la Majorité Presidentielle or lUMP Unió per la Majoritat Presidencial Ive yet to see many articles about the Peoples Party Spain We Can or Citizens but yet United Left and Spanish Workers Socialist Party appear to be in use

My rationale for this is that I would always refer to Carrer Balmes rather than Balmes Street to Poblenou rather than New Town and to the Eixample rather than the Expansion  but then I might be biased so want to hear alternative points of view

This is meant to be the start of a discussion rather than anything else Please add to the discussion 

If the result of this is that names shouldnt be translated Id recommend that this page me moved to Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya and for example Initiative for Catalonia  Greens be moved to Iniciativa per Catalunya  Verds
