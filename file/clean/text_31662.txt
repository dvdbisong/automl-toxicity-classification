Article is already well Defined 

Research in context as an article is and should only be relevant to scientific investigation Period  Any other uses of the term Research can also be defined in their own applicable environment provided adequate references from appropriate sources  However I do not believe this article should be further diluted too much outside of the scientific arena purpose it serves to describe  Article must identify serious academic purpose and not necessarily describe a person researching a family tree for example  Does anyone have any objections to this proposal of maintaining certain limitationsrestrictions for this article
