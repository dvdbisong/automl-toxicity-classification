Concerning DIREKTORs and Novangelis vandalism of my edits on Macroevolution 

Why are you guys trolling Direktor How is it an invented term to say macroevolutionary biologists WHEN THAT IS WHAT IS BEING REFERRED TO ON THE MACROEVOLUTION PAGE Can you get any more absurd Was biologists in references to CREATIONIST BIOLOGISTS OF COURSE NOT and yet in keeping with a weasel you would have it so that people think biologists are only those who support MACROEVOLUTION Second what does it matter even if it were an invented term is that a sin Is that forbidden in Wikipedia Third ITS A PHRASE pointing out to what type of biologists are being referred to and there is no law in Wikipedia and it is no sin to clarify Fourth I already stated why I was removing as I said in the notes certain references which were not relevant Fifth what does the fact that the mainstream and it was also left out the scientific community mentioned was the MAINSTREAM one again with the weaselwording and bigotry have to do with CRITICISMS of macroevolution NOTHING its distracting propaganda used to distract any reader from focusing on the criticisms and to instead focus on THE ALLEGED CONSENSUS and as administrators in Wikipedia love to point out only when it is convenient the truth is not determined by consensus Can you answer my points NO you cant Mr LOLz all you can do is repeat and divert those who input the truth to the talk page to delay endlessly any progress with the pretense of the encyclopedia anyone can edit and truth isnt determined by consensus The first immature remark you left in your first reversion of my edit shows what kind of mind you have your level of maturity and your true concern for facts none All you can do is make insults mere claims based on your feelings while disregarding any reasons anyone gives you if they dont agree with your feelings
