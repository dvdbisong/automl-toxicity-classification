Curious as to why you want to be a busybody with me 
I am curious as to why you want to be a busybody with me  Ive noticed you following me around before  For example in the entries for Michel DavidWeill whom I am sure you know nothing about and Edouard Stern whom I am also sure you know nothing about I made minor edits yet you reversed them for being uncited      even though the entire bios are totally uncited  Whats your beef  Why dont you delete the entire article  I know the subject matter you dont  It has something to do with me  you desire some sort of association with me  I feel as if I am being stalked  normally stalking is done by the opposite sex but in this case youre a man chasing a man  I had another Wiki administrator do this and on his home page he admits that he is a flaming homosexual  Dont tell me you too
