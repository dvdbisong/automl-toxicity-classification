Id like to agree with many posters here 

The Christmas holiday has nothing to do with Christ  I would like to cite the historical section of our artical which clearly illustrates that the holiday was and is Pagan not Christian  By continuing to mislead people that Jesus has anything to do with that holiday you are attempting to rewrite history and that is not our job

I would suggest that the article start off saying something to the effect
Christmas is a Christianized term for a traditional holiday practiced by many cultures throughout the world

I think that would be a more accurate opening
