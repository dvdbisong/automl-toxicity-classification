Please adjudicate something for me  

I completed the framework of the Pulitzer prizes 2014 article I posted an ITN nominee for it as its of wide interest and we have the article to support 

2014 Pulitzer Prize

I am getting stonewalled by the room for using a Snowden picture in the ITN header 

httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaIn_the_newsCandidatesNSA_Stories_take_Pulitzer_Prize

I am using a Snowden picture because 1 the NSA revelations won the main prize 2 Right now a list of news media leading with Snowdens picture goes  CNN Fox News ABC Al Jazeera Reuters Thats 3 of the american big 4 and 2 of the global 3 MSNBC are going Will papers win Pulitzer for Snowden stories and the BBC have the Guardian guy Article is essentially ready to go 

The room is telling me they hate the sight of Snowden and that theres reasons why his picture cant be used despite the fact almost all other outlets are using it Seems like irrational consensus 

Please adjudicate and if Im wrong to use his picture in the ITN thing then Ill lose it The article is of course generic and without pictures outside of the prize itself I have mentioned the main winner only in short form before moving on to the list 

Thank you
