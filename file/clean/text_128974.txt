FileJack Conwayjpg 

Hi GageSkidmore  Please stop adding a  tag to FileJack Conwayjpg like you did here  The file is not a blatant copyright violation because the uploader did not source the file to themselves under a Public Domain GFDL or Creative Commons license  I understand you are trying to help but please refrain from adding the tag again as it is considered disruptive editing  Regards  TALK
