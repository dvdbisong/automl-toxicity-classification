Moved  

Ive moved the article partially because there are other linguistic uses of the word accent but also because the interwikis are all mixed up The articles were about stress syllable prominence regional accent and foreignlanguage acquisition accents Im now going through the other WPs and reducing their iws to WPen stress accent phonetics or accent dialect 

I have no particular attachment to the dab I chose for this article and if any of you have a better idea Im not planning on defending it
