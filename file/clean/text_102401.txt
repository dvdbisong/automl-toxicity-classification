The list seemed to be getting clogged particularly with recent alumni who have yet to accomplish any particularly notable achievements as professional athletes I removed Marlins pitcher Andrew Miller who has had one mediocre season in the majors Red Sox prospect and minor leaguer Daniel Bard NFL free agent Brian Simmons tennis player Nick Monroe runner Shalane Flanagan  Charlotte Bobcats Sean May and Raymond Felton and ESPN announcer Stuart Scott 

None of these folks aside from Stuart Scott have made their respective sports allstar teams won a major event or even been honored as their leagues top rookie If being a professional athlete is the only standard needed to be on this list then it needs to be much longer But that would be unweildy  Stuart Scott doesnt belong because of the way the list is introduced He is an announcer not an alumni from the varsity athletic program 

I left current professional athletes who have been recognized within their sport and the iconic retirees such as Eddie Pope and Michael Jordan Ill happily revert if thats what people want
