First of all I know that its free to edit Ive heard that a million times and I meant to say my article as in my edits not my personal article Second I said Im American because you claim youre from London and I figure that theres different things you see in London that are different from what Americans see thus making you have negative feelings for the edit not sure if my theory is right Im just thinking that Third have you ever seen Charlie Countryman I remember every moment in that movie and perfectly plotted it on the article despite a few misunderstandings If you could give a list of what I screwed up then I would understand On top of all that I DONT want to argue about this I just want to deal with my more important personal issues and go back to watching 24 So if we both dont like each others edits I have a solution that HAS to work for both of us Please deliver your feedback after you see the edit  Theironminer  452 PM 16 June 2014
