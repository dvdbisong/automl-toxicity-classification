JP thank you for finally explaining what your problem is Of course what Jackson said is relevant This is an article on Jesse Jackson If Jackson puts his foot in his mouth it is relevant A cited statement does not violate NPOV I learned that fact the hard way when I tried to edit cited statements out of the article on Michael Savage As far as whether or not Jackson contradicted himself are you denying that Jackson used to be for interracial marriage Do you want me to cite a source saying that he used to be for interracial marriage Liberals like Jackson have always referred to conservative whites from the south who opposed interracial marriage as racists Evidently its in for a minority to be against interracial marriage though Or maybe its that white men cant have black women but black men can have white women with Jesse Its pretty obvious to me that if Jackson is now saying that its illegal for a white man to fantasize about a black woman What the hell does he mean by this Its perfectly legal to fantasize What an idiot then he is obviously against white men dating black women He wants whitey to keep his hands off black property Perhaps Jackson needs a translator since he frequently says things that make no sense Do you know what Jackson meant I honestly dont see any violation Please elaborate further and we can work out a compromise However I will get the statement in the article Liberals who hate Michael Savage have a bunch of negative quotes about him in his article so I think that its fair for a conservative like me to get in negative quotes about Mr Jackson as long as the quotes are cited by a reputable source
