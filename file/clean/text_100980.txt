Wambssgans Triple Play 1920 

Could you please post up a larger photo ie not so severely reduced
In the picture thats there its hard to tell whats going on  It LOOKS like Wambsganss is the player in the home field uniform in the upper left and the runner is wearing grey but the other players posture is all wrong for a runner at the time of being tagged out  More detail would make this photo better and the copyright on this photo is expired
