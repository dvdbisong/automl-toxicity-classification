Hi Steve wow thanks for all your time thats really nice of you The Lion with the circle you have is the old one which was repaced by the double lion badge The new one is just like the one I showed you except it has a black outline I tried the offical site and they seem to be pulling every trick in the book to conceal the new one Ive done quite an extensive search but cant seem to find it I did however find a page that said the new one had been uploaded by wikipedia userPal and has been deleted I dont know if they can help All the very best
