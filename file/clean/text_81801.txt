I have not yet seen Tims paper I assume that it demonstrates that lithium is not an essential nutrient by its absence That doesnt kick it out of OMM The claim seems that lithium and orotate ions are naturally occurring utilizable substances in the diet and orthomolecular substances packaged in a salt similar to common synthetic vitamins eg thiamine nitrate vs the natural cocarboxylase pyrophosphate OMM is not so synthetic friendly to the alien enantiomers in synthetic oil solubles  However Lithium is most certainly a naturally occuring item in the water of many places growing up in one place whose water source contained Li this was something of a joke about why people were so mellow This will come up about others like strontium which are reputed to be good for the bones too the natural versions considered OMM Then there is strontium ranelate a xenobiotic because of the artificial anion  OMMs relation to pharmacological herbs seems ambivalent for several reasons  One probably is that the largest body adopting the most adapting from OMM are probably the naturopaths so if it is in the approved garden why sweat it  Honestly though there is the question how do we define xenobiotic and not xenobiotic in OMM I dont have a fast answer myself between applying Paulings definition and the definite feeling that some plant extracts are not OMM but xenobiotics  One can probably develop a Socratic argument starting with hemlock As for the St Johns Wort the plant contains things that are definitely nutrients The extract is a homework assignment This is one of the gray areas where my impression is that one may traverse from the orthomolecular field to the herbal part of naturopathy without necessarily encountering a clear boundary Sort of like the pressurized critical path skirting water heating experiment with no clear phase change between liquid and steam and back One other comment is that it is okay if something is not OMM OMM does not claim to be the be all end all answer or a jealous god er guild OMM MDs do apply conventional drugs and surgery more sparingly they probably just dont get as many free boat trips but the Glacier cruise is nice
