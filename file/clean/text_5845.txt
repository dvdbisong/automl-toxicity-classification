University of Karachi Project

Im trying to clean up some of the projects listed in WikipediaSchool and University Projects and your name pops up associated with Wikipedia_talkMass_communication_in_Pakistan  Is it safe to say that this is no longer a planned project and perhaps a completed one  Thanks  Thelmadatter
