Hi Soccerholic I understand your arguments to delete hidden data this data was controlled by me its not original research these list is the hard work to input new players and adding goals when finalizes every match consulting every match in the official page This page is the only official to provide official information such as goalscorers goalkeepers cards minutes played match to match These page like LFP Squad stats goes wrong with Mozilla so its problem of RFEF and LFP you can enter this pages in Internet Explorer and goes correctly There are not a specially section in RFEF neither LFP for goalscorers lists but in the url I imputed LFP Squad stats you can check out all goals of all players selecting season 201011 Liga BBVA and the correspondent team Well all hidden data had the aim to update rapidly this lists but as you say its not appropiate to stay at this page hidden later I will put on my user page Sorry for this bad english and to write so disorganized Another question Im the first to hate these silly disput about 14 or 15 goals of Cristiano but yesterday I noted that block expires today and I found out these Solomonic solution to turn off future war edits there are people in love with Cristiano so it makes me laugh the insistence and interest to put one more goal to Cristiano Now there are people who will dispute the one more goal in the infobox in top goalscorer this field must be about official goals RaulReus  1502 24 November 2010 UTC1
