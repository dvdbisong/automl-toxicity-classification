I was asked to contribute here by Faendalimas I have no knowledge of the background to the two genus names in question There are however some obvious problems with the articles current text Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced and editorial opinions and recommendations are given I dont think there can be any justification for including editorialising like The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play or leading statements like The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is science or just politics and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells name for this taxon We can only repeat or report what the sources say In this case we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson 2010 concluded that Wells publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN and that they disputed whether WÂ dorsei warranted recognition as a separate species I have seen similar cases elsewhere with statements like this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN1 where the citation is to the ICZN itself which naturally doesnt mention the case in question  this is to my mind obviously unacceptable On less contentious issues how many species are there in the genus We learn that the genus currently contains five  species but only four are listed I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information rather than a blank contradiction External links are meant to be a service to the reader which that link isnt at the moment no 2 in WPELNO
