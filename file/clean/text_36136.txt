Stanley Meyers water fuel cell
Your work on this article reads thusly 
 Youve removed at least one rather extraordinarily reliable source
 Youve promised some sort of reference supporting your views
 Youve reverted the restoration of the reliable source
 Youve promised to explain your actions on the talk page but failed to follow up

This gives every appearance of editing in bad faith Please considering carefully your next edits to this article  or perhaps give up editing it entirely The evidence against Stanley Meyer is overwhelming and the articles history is as a crank magnate As an experienced editor you really dont want to align yourself with bad science
