A request 

I ask that you consider taking time away from posting on WTV or the subpage Your posts there particularly the multiple polls became disruptive several weeks ago and the page has basically ground to a halt because of it I took six weeks off from editing either the policy or the talk pagefrom around June 20 until August 7just to make sure other peoples voices were heard equally so I hope youll consider doing the same If your proposals are truly supported they wont be affected by your absence  TALKCONTRIBS 

I agree that the main talk page needs a breather from this whole topic  And Im ready for quiet work on it in an obscure place for a while  If you want that to not be the subpage thats fine with me but I just said there that I went along with the subpage idea  Sincerely  North8000  

The main talk page needs a long long breather But I think you need a breather too from this topic partly for your own sake but also to see whether it has legs without you At things stand youre doing two things simultaneously and in something of a contradiction keeping it going and strengthening opposition to it because of the overkill If you would let it be you would see whether it has legs of its own Anyway just a request  TALKCONTRIBS 

Im ready to slip into low key homework on this even without a request  Me suggesting that we adopt the first sentence just proposedsuggested by Jimbo Wales was a sort of special departure from that I saw that as acting more as a facilitator  I noticed that somebody tried to hide the fact that it was HIS suggestion by changing the section title North8000  

But not before reverting and continuing to disrupt You are posting an inherently POV poll RfCs are supposed to be neutrally worded I give up on you because it is pointless  TALKCONTRIBS 

 I dont think that it is POV to say who wrote the proposed wording  That was the original title of the section its the title that people commented under and it provides the information of who wrote it   Since when in Wikipedia does saying the source of something get called POVing it And dont forget there is a second dimension to this  I put up HIS suggestion and people are removing the fact that it was HIS suggestion simultaneously with villianizing me for putting it up a suggestion on the first sentence  I call that dirty pool  But as I said I put it it up as a facilitator and dont plan to further advocate it  North8000
