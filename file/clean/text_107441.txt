TO Sushi Leone
The value of human life is absolute and indefeasible  and so are human rights To deny it systematically is nothing else but inhuman relativism that leads to totalitarism
That is right Thus put the number of other nation death close to German casulties Putting the numbers separately suggests you selective intentions One cry about his looses and forgot about the offended party casualties I say put first think first I proposed to mark in first sentence that the expulsion was direct result of Nazi German aggression and unprecedented savagery Is not truth
When someone tries to rape a child or to burn it alive and you do not help it because your intervention depends on the ethnic background of the child I would seriously question your moral integrity
That is right Unfortunately German Nazi did it and why Germans supported Hitler so much or what Why the Germans did not stop Hitler before he got to much power Etc etc That question the ethic of all nation is not it And are you referring by some accident to others then the Nazis actions Where is the proof that some bandits of Polish nationality did it Do not you accuses others for German Nazi attitude just for moral confort
The same when you help to conceal this incident  that would be a  retrospective  participation in this incident or at least an act of aiding and a betting it
You are damn right So what is you explanation to Hitler success Why he was not stopped before WW II started
But this article is not about moral philosophy it is supposed to be an objective description of a specific issue  based on quantitative research And it should be left to the reader to come to a  subjective  conclusion
I do not think the spreading of ESTIMATIOM is quantitative research I challenge you to provide international research result And about the subjective reader conclusion let me remain you Dr G says A lie repeated many times become truth
TO ALL I think those guys who are not Polish or German should voluntarily withdrawal from the argument They do more harm to the question than both interested parties I mean German and Polish would like to see I already have in my mine one particularly TROLLING individual
