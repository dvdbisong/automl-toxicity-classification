Albanian Military 

Hello I would like to raise a concern that there are two vandals UserNoclador  UserMrMacMan they have been editing all articles that have to do with the Albanian military non are correct I have been blocked in two occasions for no reason I have tried talking with them and reasoning with them but they are not listening they even changed the my words that I put in their discussion are to seem like I was attacking them so I would get banned I would really appreciate if you take some action against these users they have only provided one source for their edit that is 3 years old and even that does not match with he figures and information they have given in their source it states that Albania operates 375 tanks and UserNoclador wrote that the tank inventory is only 79 which does not match at all with his source every time I fix the information so it matches with his source he reverts it I also have added the PVO banner because me and some other people do not agree with their sources and they keep removing it

I have cities all of my edits but for some reason they keep changing them with older information and as it ways in the wikipedia dispute article you should give let them have their wary and I am letting them use their source for now but they can at least quote their source correctly and not make number from the top of their heads
