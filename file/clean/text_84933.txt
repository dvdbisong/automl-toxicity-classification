Christopher Pyne Australian Politician 

Christopher Pyne has extraordinarily used the word cunt in the Australian Parliament and appears to like to use the word to refer to some of his colleagues  Despite this being in new asrticles in print media and on the web it perhaps isnt worthy enough for the article  Just mentioning it in case Mr Pyne keeps being cunty and using the word cunt at which point the proper references would need to be looked up and cited etc 14200208126
