Dear MrSlrubenstein Your point about NOR and verifiable sources is well taken Accordingly I am providing an official Government of India biography of Ram Mohan Roy from the Press  Information Ministry of India which claims that Roy studied Judaism in addition to other religions The URL is httppibnicinfeaturefeyr2002fmay2002f020520021html  I do not know if you will recognise this because this same government for many years did not recognise the State country of Israel Of course this only states that Roy studied Judaism and is not conclusive proof that Brahmoism was influenced by Judaism However we find significant similarities between the Brahmo Dharma beej of 1850 and some tenets of Judaism such as Maimonides You will appreciate that these issues are unproveable and matters of faith and I do not doubt yours Likewise I leave it up to you to do the right thing Brahmos are highly unlikely to claim that they are Jews of any kind or distort  vandalise your religionfaith My Brahmo religion specifically prohibits reviling or disparaging other faiths whilst emphasising strengthening the bonds between men of different faiths I personally have not known many Jews Judaists as there are so few in India I was lucky to have a learned tutor  his name was Ezra  he had a PhD and attended synagogue and I learnt many things from him besides Mathematics I respect your wishes to scrutinise all the other faiths which claim to have been influenced by Judaism Sincerely
