Ginger Jolie 

I found your comments in this deletion discussion rather confusing The subject according to the posted request asked for the deletion of the article because she is an upwardly mobile sex worker moving up from Hustler to Penthouse to Maxim wants verifiable material about her past deleted only because it makes her less marketable  I also noticed when I looked at her website that shes got a phony message up about adverse consequences to people who report her to their credit card company for not refunding their membership fees after she shut down her website This is clearly a scam artist not someone trying to recover any privacy or dignity
