Birth Name
I have mixed feelings about this  On the one hand he obviously wants to be known by his stage name and his privacy should be respected  On the other hand stating that his birth name is Stanard Q Ridgway is simply providing misinformation  His real name is wellknown in the music industry  Here are a couple of pages demonstrating this

His birth name is also listed in the published credits for the authorship of the song Mexican Radio  Here are a couple of examples of citations

Therefore Ive simply deleted the birth name item from the infobox
