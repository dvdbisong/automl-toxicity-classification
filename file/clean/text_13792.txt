Dianetics confusion 

There seems to be a bit of confusion or maybe just poorlyconstructed passages about when Dianetics was written and published The first mention seems to indicate he wrote it in 1950 and that it was then published in 1949 And then later when its talking about the Emeter it mentions a Dianetics enthusiast inventing it in the 1940s
