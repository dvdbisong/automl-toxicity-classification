Sorry but you go to far in protecting IronDuke  I havent edited the page in question since you asked me to stop but you allow him to replace the attack  WPNPA says Specific examples of personal attacks include but are not limited to Accusatory comments such as Bob is a troll or Jane is a bad editor can be considered personal attacks if said repeatedly in bad faith or with sufficient venom  This situation clearly qualifies  And WPRPA says that I can refactor to eliminate the personal attack  I have done so  It isnt an edit war  In any case you can stop it by the simple act of telling IronDuke to stop accusing me of being a sockpuppet  If he had evidence or you thought it was true I would be banned by now no doubt  What I am asking is simple fairness  I have reluctantly done as you asked now dont create a free field for attacking accusations   1602
