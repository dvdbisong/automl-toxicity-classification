Comancheria 

I have several problems with this section and think it needs to be at the very least removed
It is not specific to Spanish Texas which is the subject of this article  The section covers a broad range of time that includes Mexican Texas the Republic of Texas and the state of Texas  That is overly broad and makes it difficult to see exactly how this relates to Spanish Texas
This relies on a single source which leads to questions about potentially being POV or not mainstream
