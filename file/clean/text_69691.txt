You must know that Rodhullandemu and DavidTokyo view the Cilla Black page as their own personal property and thus will not allow any edits to be made without their consent Its a waste of time trying to improve the article unless they explicity permit it Id not bother again if I were you And alas since neither has anything better to do and regard wikipedia as a job youll never get one over on either of them
