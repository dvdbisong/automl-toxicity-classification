today is the worse day of my life For 20 years this beautiful girl has been at my side waiting at my door and purring me to sleep each and every night In a hour I have to put her down To add to the pain a Wikipedia admin has banned me from the site for speaking my mind and replying to another users comments I guess the first amendment is out the window here I have never felt worse in my 50plus years on this earth and I owe Wikipedia a big thank you for helping make this the worse day ever talk
