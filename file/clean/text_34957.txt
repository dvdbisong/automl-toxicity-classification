Is it possible to add a poem or stanza or couplet of poetry

I think it would be great to have a bit of Simics poetry in here The only glimpse is one quoted line and even then its not clear that this is from a a poem 

Also or failing that the article could identify by title a couple of typical or wellknown Simic poems 

I could do this if nobody else feels particularly motivated to do so
