ImageInsideAgraFortjpg 

I would like to draw attention to the text below the photo labeled InsideAgraFortjpg as seen on the Wikipedias Red Fort at Agra page It states that the photograph was taken at Khas Mahal This is incorrect as this location is known as the Musamman Burj where Shahjahan spent the last seven years of his life under house arrest by his son Aurganzeb
