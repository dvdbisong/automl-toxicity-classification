The problem with that argument is that it assumes your presence will help to build an encyclopedia and there are quite a few people who feel your past behavior has hindered the building of it wasted their time or will be a distraction to them and others on here if you are back  Just because its the encyclopedia that anyone can edit doesnt mean it is the encyclopedia that everyone should edit  That idea seems to be lost on some critics that there is no right to edit Wikipedia  David
