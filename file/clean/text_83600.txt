It is your opinion and hey good for you that Kosovo is an independent country and nothing else And that the only reason it would be presented as disputed would be that wikipedia is a little bit afraid of RussoSerbian reactions Thats your opinionand honestly that second part is ridiculous Anyway the first part of your opinion that Kosovo is a country and nothing else is simply not based in any facts and is not a view held world wide As Wikipedia is an Encylcopeida and it is not your personal soapbox the article will present the prevailing world views in a neutral manner And when you take those into account Kosovo is very much a disputed territory As WPWWIN suggests perhaps you should start a blog where you can present your opinion without fear of having to remain neutral That is of course unless you are the one who fears RussoSerbian reactions
