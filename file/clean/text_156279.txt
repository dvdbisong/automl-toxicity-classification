Do you even have a life You do understand that there is FAR more to life than going around editing various articles in hopes of making a difference I mean honestly will it matter in 100 years whether or not someone properly notated a freelicensing copyright on an obscure out of the way picture from a person that died 13 years ago No It wont matter Im sorry you live the miserable existence that you do
