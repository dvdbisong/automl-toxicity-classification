As always Cyndy Im sure we will have a lively engagement  There have been some good edits and questionable ones during the past week although I do have some big concerns regarding some safety and vaccination stuff in particular the weight issue  It seems that you and I are most editors at chiropractic can find the middle ground  Im waiting to hear from MastCell and Jehochman as to where we go from here  Looking back on it I made some mistakes but I believe that this blocking issue could have been better handled as well  Hopefully all parties involved learned a lesson  See you soon
