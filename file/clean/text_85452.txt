Thanks for the note Str1977  I am working to amend a portion that was added to the BenXVI entry  The addition was in itself a totally unnecessary diatribe in criticism of American conservatism  If the Pope had made a statement in such a light it would make sense but no such statement was referenced  I will continue to work on it but I am working against some who wish to use the Popes entry as a platform from which to criticise American conservatism
