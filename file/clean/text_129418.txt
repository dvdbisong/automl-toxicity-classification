The final countdown 
Thank you for those of you who provided input to step four It is now very nearly time for the RfC I have applied the results of the step four discussion to the RfC draft and it is now basically ready for user comments There are a few aspects of the RfC that havent been discussed such as my choice of wording in the intro and the exact numbering of the drafts I randomised them using randomorg I am going to leave a couple of days for everyone to review the draft and provide feedback and Ill put it up live at  If its just a small matter of copyediting you can go ahead and edit the draft page yourself If it might be more contentious it is probably better to discuss it here So here is my very last question
