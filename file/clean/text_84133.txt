I did have a problem with the same guy being plaintif judge and jury twice the first time not even bothering to follow protocol  i did not take him seriously just laughed at his second block and belived that he would get away with it a second time being all three only since im so impopular  however at the same time i considered that if there was any real justification for his actions a third party would do the same And that is what you did Not only are you a third party that seemingly agrees with his desicion you also have passionatly defended my works against people like him on several occasions Therefore i respect you and take your advice with the highest respect

I would request you to help me in this mater and if you percive me violating WPCIVIL and WPNPA again then please  1 notify me 2 give me a explanation of how i did it and 3 how i should have done it and i will 1 retract my statment whadever it may be 2 rephrace it and 3 ask for an apology to the victim of my error 

As for MONGO he is on the far opposite side of where you stand in my view I whold have a promblem seeing him having right even if he was right for once
