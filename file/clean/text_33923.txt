Article length
i started to get bogged down editing the article its good but im wondering if it should be shortened like you were talking about i like a lot of the detail but by the time i got to the influences section i was thinking that much of that should be in the articles for each member with maybe just a summary paragraph pointing people there in a subtle way kinda disappointed we dont have more comments because even though i havent read the article too many times its hard to stay objective while editing re POV i think theres still plenty we can remove there although i took a few pieces out this last time through i find that whenever it starts sounding like a rolling stone article instead of an encyclopedia i get the heebie jeebies a bit ill step away for a while and come back in a day or two we also might want to consider alternate org strategies heading sequence etc though my attempts to find a better sequence always come back to what you made  mainly because of the rotating lead singers the table of contents seems too convoluted though maybe something can be done from that angle
