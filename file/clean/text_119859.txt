Hi Rick Norwood Funny but I find just the opposite to be true Badly written edits ie blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles are mostly done by leftleaning socialist modern liberal etc editors Also the large majority of editors and not suprisingly admins here at the wiki are socialist and in general leftleaning and are dominating many of the political articles The meaning of words the correct charictarization of ideologies and history itself is being altered This article is a prime example of this aricle takeover and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia This is sad to me because what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge has been turned into a giant machine that spits out nonfact censorship and well just plain propagandistic cow flop Sorry if that sounds harsh Thats what I see I love Wikipedia and would like to see it be once again what it started out to be duck talk
