Well since tony the tigeri mean marine seems to be waffling and going back on his report of NYC being confirmed to him a friend or maybe his mother who really knows he seems to be selfserving and desirious of chnaging facts rules policies et al in order to gain favor from future voters for gov of PR when he runs He certainly has shown his true colors and how he ever became an administrator surely puts wiki at the forefront of the pandering and self serving purposes displayed her I think I know a way that those who support puerta rico as his pob tony should ask his friend the cop in florida to write an internet article about baez and include in it a reference to the tmz and other bogus references and the report that baez office personnel lied and that baez was indeed born in puerta rico Then they would have support of a confirmed verifiable and believable source to cite in place of the nationally televised television interview given by BW Subsequently the puerta rican loving dirtbags can invalidate any consensus and ignore ever one that is in search of the truth This entry has been archived and we shall see if this page remains or disappears from any view Have a nice day
