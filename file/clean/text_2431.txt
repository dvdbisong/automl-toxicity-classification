Interesting logic some of the other comics mentioned by Mark Evanier existed therefore this one must have existed Well here is what Mark Evanier himself has to say about it on his own website at httpwwwnewsfrommecomarchives2003_08_09html007191
And the comic book based on The Dick Van Dyke Show wasnt drawn by anyone since it didnt exist Yeah Im sorry Its a phony that I cobbled up using an old still and pieces from other Gold Key covers I wish they had done such a comic and if they had it would probably have been drawn by Dan Spiegle But they never did so I whipped up the cover to one to see if anyone would notice
