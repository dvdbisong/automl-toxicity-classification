Both in current numbers 24 and in historical context Roman Catholics are a minority religion in America Even among Christian believers the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants This is no suprise of the 13 colonies only one had a significant Catholic presence Maryland Today of the 24 Catholics most about 1214 of the country are now Catholic hispanics mostly in California Texas and Florida probably more with undocumented Mexicans The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics in the Northeastern cities Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated and live in the South and Midwest There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the other Of the ProtestantReformation movement most are mainline or evangelicalborn againfundamentalist churches Orthodox are not a Reformation faith but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic developing Reformation movement Of the 20 not now calling themselves Christian most are agnostic probably with mostly Protestant roots but some are Muslim Jewish or have Asianrooted faiths The main things apparently affecting religious population size are Mexican immigration Catholic mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate declining conservative Protestant activism increasing intermarriage tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism ergo all conservative churches bornagains opus dei othodox jewry increasing In sum Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination 24 compared to next largest Baptists but a Christian faithmovement smaller in size by half than the ProtestantReformation movement and again in historical context in America not a surprise 2 November 2005
