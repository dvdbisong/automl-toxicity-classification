Its important to remember WPNOPV when editing articles Your edit constituted vandalism as it was portraying the party in a negative light Im fairly sure any other editor would have used that template Thats not me being POV thats me attempting to be neutral Besides this sentence has now been removed altogether so theres little reason worrying about it now What I would probably suggest to you if you havent already is that you create an account for Wikipedia of course you dont have to  just a suggestion  but a lot of editors are often suspicious of anonymous editors
