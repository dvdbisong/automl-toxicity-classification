 I object to this Its not a calendar year that the competition runs in but a football season While it will be done before the end of 2014 it still takes place within the 201415 football season as shown on the info box below and when the next season edition and so on takes place with a January final will create an odd situation where there is a 2014 FFA Cup article then 201516 and ongoing 20xxxx article titles It is better to standardise them now to a full seasonal date There is also the possibility that a shift in competition dates over multiple seasons could see a competition run entirely in the first half of the year followed by another edition of the tournament that starts and finishes in the second half of the year which would lead to a very odd title situation if we go by a calendar year article title process eg we could end up with a hypothetical situation of having to disambiguate two editions of the tournament played in the same calendar year despite being in different football seasons   0914 15 May
