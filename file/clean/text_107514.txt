I love the South Beach Diet  when I started it I was 278lbs and at 31 having breathing problems chest pains and all kind of problems I am 64 and always carried the weight well I thought I have now lost 53lbs since March and am a lot healthier and fitter without doing much more exercise I have to admit that as a total foodie and cook I enjoying using my imagination to create healthy meals within phase I and II and it works for me I dont miss bread potatoes or pasta in the slightest Beer was my big problem but now I just have few glasses of Argentine malbec instead  Happy days  0848 24 August
