Gday Bidgee and Dlinth firstly let me reveal my interests and just say I am a sandgroper but I am also a Wikipedian with a commitment to order and integrity  I had earlier thought that Perth was the most isolated city in the world with a population over a million with the closest city of comparable size being Surabaya or Jakarta  In fact neither fact was true which I confirmed by using the online GIS application Mapcrow  I believe that using the same GIS application should confirm distances and any comparisions between different pairs of cities
