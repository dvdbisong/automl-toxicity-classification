Some more detail about Mormonism and constructions fundaments 

Regarding polygamism with early mormons Joseph Smith and his first group of 12 mens were using it all the time but hidding it from their wifes Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens without the knowledge of his wife and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect

As the first wife of J Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce so angry she was against him Joseph Smith changed his mind It made J Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules which made the other male members angry at him It end up as a polygamism rule but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power 
It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books he was contacted by various members of masonics loges and many of this church rituals both sacred and profane are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic ordersrituals Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions therefor the mormons books looks more for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories well known within other religious groups than a religion in itself Nothing in the mormon books is original all is taken from somewhere else often with quiet a unimaginativ mind

The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source or even ressembling source for all the tribes described there 
Another correction to what some have earlier stated here there is a hell in mormons theory 
Only true mormon true knights of the later days saints and else being it since as most generations as possible have access to heaventhe upper part nearest to God The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members And out of it is hell for non mormon who cannot access the other levels and will never been able to be in the upper levels It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching and I heard it several times by mormons priests that there is no salvation for non mormon Christian go to hell too and none of the christian priests are recognized as such nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone and they teach that even the first apostles those walking around Jesus Christ were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there until Jesus christ himself took to latin america and baptised a bunch of by mistakelandedtherehebrews and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith 
And thats the way the story goes

The foundator of the christian church is by definition unable to baptise others Peter was spiritually impotent if we are to believe the mormonic song 
A way one can undoubtly see the influence of freemasonry in the mormon church is their attribution of 1st and second degree of priesthood like a copypaste of hebraic traditions with some dubious change into it 
You are missing here also the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons clearly prevail It is for exemple today teached that the upper god is a goddess the wife of God and higher than him and that she cant be named and very little is known about her because she is OH so high and special It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest nor baptised is that women are per birth closer to god than men and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have and thats why women must do other things in the mean time like give birth to more mormons members do the cleaning and make food and play missionary 1Â½ year of their life just before getting married as soon as they return from mission time All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things without risking having them asking certain questions very up to date very warms and never answered by this church 
There is of course nowhere in the mormon books where anyone could actually read exactly the thing stated above but the
