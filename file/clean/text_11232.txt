Jesus and Messianic prophecy 

Hey I dont know if this is technically where I should be posting this sorry if its not

1 Fine if retort isnt 100 appropriate then Ill use counterargue that is the meaning I was trying to get across

But I think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with Wikipedias guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general

2 You said Christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a timeline for the Messiahs actions and the New Testament especially the Book of Revelation detail how some of the prophecies will come to fruition later  This is a bit vague and raises some questions Which Christians Where did they say that How did they detail it Can you reference it from a notableseminotable scholar

First I cant point to a place in the Old Testament where the timeline DOESNT exist you know what I mean There is no Jewish timeline so it cannot be referenced But the New Testament does have a Christian timeline as detailed in the Book of Revelation Now which Christians hold to this belief Essentially all of them all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the Bible which is essentially all Where did Christian authors detail this belief In the Bible How did they detail it They wrote it in the Bible That is why I made Bible references Which scholar can I quote How about John the Apostle who wrote Revelation Is one of the founders of Christianity an acceptable source on the subject

I find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing Christians believe Jesus came back from the dead as detailed in various places including the gospels and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting Bible passages and asking which Christians believe that 

3 You said This includes Jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse Revelation 1922  although it does reference The Bible if left alone it sounds rather confusing It also does not specifically reference a line from Revelation nor does it reference which version of The Bible it quotes King James NIV etc which could mean a slight difference in the quote 

If you want many specific Bible quotes then Ill put those in and Ill list if its KJV or whatever But I dont think thats required as my broad citation of Rev 1922 does clearly explain exactly what Im talking about including a physical kingdom on earth a messianic age of righteousness and so on Just because I didnt dissect it and show a specific line for each point doesnt mean they arent there any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters

If I had written The story of Noahs Ark is in Genesis 69 would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague Just because I didnt give a synopsis with ten references doesnt mean its unworthy just look it up 

4 What bothers me most is how this whole thing started when I tried to correct incorrect data on your site the line that Christians dont believe in a physical resurrection That line had NO references So even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post dont they You cant delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all

5 Im sure youll disagree with me on this one but most of all I think that my contribution didnt need to cite ANYTHING as it is such common knowledge that Christians believe in Judgment Day an age of peace etc I feel like Im in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief 

Its almost as bad as someone posting Christians dont believe Jesus was tried executed and came back to life then I post that they do citing Luke 2024 then you saying that it is too vague etc It was pure courtesy to give the citation its such common knowledge that Christians believe these things

But whatever Ill repost with a several morespecific quotes And BTW you may think Whoa this guy care WAY too much about Wikipedia and Im a mod but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented And I hate inconsistency
