Yes it does and so far the information I have seen states correctional facilities but it the act does extend to not only state run prisons and juvenile correctional facilities but to nursing homes and mental facilities  I think the stress is on the institutionalized person tag that is given  I am finishing stuff up for the class I was doing this project for but I will continue to work with this page and that is one of the areas that I need to add information to  The act looks at five specific staterun institutions and I hopefully will be able to add information to them down the line but there is not much information out there  Most of what I can find is focused on juvenile facilities  Thank you for pointing this out to me though  Stephen Jones
