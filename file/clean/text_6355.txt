This is such a fun entry   Devotchka

I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldnt she tell the difference between USAEnglish and British English she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages  Kind of keeps things in perspective eh 
Not suprising While I can easily tell the difference between French German Italian Spanish Dutch etc put me in a room with a Chinese Japanese Korean Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldnt tell the difference If I saw it written Id probably have somewhat more luck though  SJK

Vietnamese has more syllablefinal consonants than Japanese I think you can tell them apart that way maybe Is this right  Juuitchan

Someone suggested Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg as a vocabulary difference  Its certainly an interesting parallel but I dont think it really belongs here  They were both artists with their own style and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested  At any rate they cant quite be considered translations because as an adjective Rube Goldberg is more specific describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions Heath Robinson in contrast is more surrealistic or fantasyoriented  LDC

As an American I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt a flat is an apartment and rubbish certainly is trash Granted I agree that a fag is not a cigarette and underground is not a subway I may do some actual research and come back and fiddle with that list  Eean

I think Americans certainly understand the use of bum for butt rubbish for trash and to a lesser degree flat for apartment  But we dont use those terms much  Point to a container for discarded things and an American will say thats a trash can a Brit will say thats a rubbish bin  Americans are more likely to use rubbish in the sense of bullshit LDC

I deleted the following pair limited Ltd and incorporated since they actually mean different things Incorporated means a corporation limited means a limited liability corporation you can also have unlimited liability corporations and no liability corporations British and Australian also Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC  SJK

I would say torch was much more common than pocket lamp which sounds quite oldfashioned Flashlight would be more easily recognised than the latter

Yes Id call it a torch and it would probably be labeled as a flashlight in its manufacturers packaging IMO torch is colloquial British English  The Anome

Oh so flashlight is correct British usage My dictionary said Am and the Oxford English Dictionary carried flashlight only in the meaning of photography Then Ill remove the entry again AxelBoldt
