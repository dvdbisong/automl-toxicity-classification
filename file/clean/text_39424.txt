 Spoilers 

I see there are some spoilers in the character section Might want to warn the readers about this  Preceding unsigned comment added by 8910038132   
Youre on an encyclopaedia Its Wikipedias job to explain things While we do try to limit spoilers theres usually not much we can to do and searching Wikipedia for something will tend to spoil it I read Star Trek XIs plot before watching it because I knew it would be on the site The problem is the same with any encyclopaedia in the world If you can spot a really major spoiler then by all means point it out and well see if we can fix it Otherwise leave it as is Besides after a game or a film or whatever is out for a certain period of time noone cares about spoilers Ive seen people complain about The Phantom Menace spoilers but thats been out for years BioShock spoilers are also a bit nonspoilerific nowadays Sing your songThe birds seeds
