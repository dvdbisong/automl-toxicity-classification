I believe there was a lengthy study done by the US Office of Surface Mining Reclamation  Enforcement Pittsburgh office and the State of Pennsylvania in the early 1980s which determined 1 extinguishing the fires was probably not technically feasible and 2 it would cost more to try and extinguish the fires than it would to purchase all properties in the town Hence Congressional relocation funding So the bottom line was money and questionnable technical feasibility The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia too deep to strip mine from the surface too many surface openings to plug and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things Thats why people needed to be relocated living in Centralia is hazardous to ones health And when coal is burned it loses 90 of its mass so the ground above often subsides opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires There have long been reports of more people living there than should be possibly including some who were paid to leave Most of them are probably related to folks in the old cemetaries who dont know and cant imagine any other home 74754313
