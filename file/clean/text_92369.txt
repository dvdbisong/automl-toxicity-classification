Hi Bbb23

I need your help and some advice about possible sockpuppetry I am also going to ping UserPBS  PBS so that he may have advice as well or if you are really busy just now

There has been ongoing disputes edit warring blatant blp issues NPAs up to like 3 now from one certain editorin and around the article for a pianist here at en wikipedia as well as the blp board edit warring boards reports by two  different editors about the same James Rhodes pianist  article page protection board where CambridgeBayWeather saw all the blp issuesthat were going on at the time she judged the need for protection there at the pianist article UserCambridgeBayWeather in her admin role semiprotected the article for one week then there were three WPNPA violations against him which I warned the editor on his talk page on two occasions

 Since then the editor has struck up a whole band of possible sock monkeys to help defend him and also some of the ones have made personal attacks againt me as well in the ani the editor filed  I have been trying to state what has actually happened over this while but there is so much disruption attacking and lacking good faith by him and some others there

I just got to thinking this is so weird All the possible soccy editors seemed to be acting in concert in how the flow of things went there so far  I just kept my thoughts about all this to myself until now but it occurred to me to check the block log of this editor to see if he had ever had any trouble with issues that he may have been blocked for  I  asked him about the two blocks listed in the report One block was for 72 hours and the next block was an INdeffinent block I noticed the offenses listed was sock puppeting and abusing multiple accounts 

When I asked him about the sockpuppetry charge in the ani he said something to the effect that he was testing wikipedias security by setting up some vandalism only accounts to test security You could read his exact storyline that he posted on there Are editors allowed to test security by making up sockpuppets to vandalize editors articles and such Is he really working for you as a clerk or something

To paraphrase he said at ani it was just a couple of accounts maybe 2 just to test with I took his word on that for awhile but then I took a break from making new articles to just try typing his editor name and sockpuppet in wp search This is what I found it had your name on it so I thought you would be the perfect person to explain to me how this works exactly titleWikipediaSockpuppet_investigationsGabucho181Archiveoldid663847791

Maybe I am not reading the pages and archives correctly since I do not follow the spi reports very often  I see people speak of a duck rule and or diffs of evidence is needed to request an investigation I do not know myself is all this meets the duck rule or if there is any real evidence that this user may be continuing to abuse multi accounts or not  But I was stunned to se reports on his  archive go back to januaey and the latest one was around may 18 Could you read this over if you have time to see if it warrants asking for all this to be checked on I do not know how to do a spi report I am not sure if it can be added on to the ongoing list that goes back several months Please look it over and let me know something I am going to work offline on my new article sets tonight and upload them tomorrow or the next day I have been doing a series of articles about different writers around the world and then I make a few stubs from red links in the one about the writer 

This is all very discouraging   
Thank you

Cheers
