Id like to do this but Im currently trying to bring some articles in particular up to GA status after doing complete rewrites for them Valkyrie Einherjar and Yggdrasil Ill bring them up to GA status once I am done with these and I have more of my books again I only have a few of them with for a few more days Messy perhaps but I think a fair warning is important and the tags do exist after all I wont revert your removal of them but at least you know why I use them
