I am the author of the article Syedna Taher Saifuddin I am sorry to hurt your feelings I have explained the issue in short in the remarks itself I thank you for your efforts and again for approaching me But seeing your edit it is very difficult to say that it is a good faith edit The way you have blanked out content changed the structure and also changed the meanings of content I know that you are very experienced and have been on Wikipedia for a long time i am new here If i am making a mistake you should guide me in that regard such that i learn how not to make such mistakes Your edits have totally floored me I can just not understand your contention regarding the article If you can discuss the same in talk page i will be greatly obliged It will also help me when i write more articles Thank you again for your time and efforts
