had ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT to cite it as spamvanity I do not own am employed shop or even live near Mouse Surplus You couldve tagged it so someone would rewrite as SENSIBLE users have done but its a young article about a company Why dont you go ahead to List of United States companies and pick off companies at your leisure It would be a shame if what YOU were doing was Vandalism Know what Im going to rebuild Mouse Surplus better than what I had it before And Im going to save it on my hard disk by TLU  

 possible AfD 

Hi I can see that you know more than a little bit about deletions so I want to get your opinion on something The article Tony Grove is a single sentence which I think fails to assert notability per WPBIO and it seems doubtful the article could reasonably be expanded Do you think this is an appropriate candidate for AfD If so should it get a Prod or just get nomd for AfD Thanks in advance for taking the time to educate this newcomer PS  I noticed you are currently located in Milwaukee WI You have my heartfelt condolences  Also you can respond here when convenient Ive got you on my watchlist   
Hey I like Milwaukee 
First Id do some quick google research on the guy and if nothing came up then give it a prod tag If someone deprods it and you still think hes NN then go with AfD Cheers  talk 

Thanks Fang Ill follow your advice I just had to tease you a little because I spent many years in WI and I hate snow  Milwaukee can be fun though especially The Safe House  

Yes The Safe House is way cool I dont like winter either but heck its home  talk 

If it feels like home to you then it must beHome I had already done the Google search as the first step out of the first 50 hits I previewed only one mentioned the guy and that was our article  It seems like its time for a prod Very exciting Ive never done this before so umerwhat do I do 

In the article add prodWhy you think it should be deleted at the top  talk 

I got the Prod in place per your directions Thanks for taking so much time to help a newcomer    
Anytime  talk 

 Deletion TheListUpdater 

I apologize that I exploded over Mouse Surplus but I would like the original content back so I can hopefully rebuild and rewrite it in the next coming months
