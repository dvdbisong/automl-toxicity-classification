Speaking without knowing what Im talking about OK how bout this the original comment I made about Everlasts entry constantly being vandalized by Eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site The feud started with the Dilated Peoples track Thats why I believed that the verse Everlast contributed should be in there and still do The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem And THAT came off an Eminem fan site
