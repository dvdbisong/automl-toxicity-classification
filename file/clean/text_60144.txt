Sarsaparilla 

In brief heres his history
 He was involved in proposing with Abd something called Delegable Proxy  I wasnt involved in that but I gather that his contributions were perceived as disruptive and he was blocked indefinitely
 He used sockpuppets to evade this block
 Eventually his block was lifted and he resumed editing openly as UserObuibo Mbstpo
 Many of his edits with this account were perceived as very annoying  he opposed all deletion for example and would make significant changes to policy pages without advance discussion citing WPBOLD and WPBRD  He also proposed new policies that could only be described as bizarre for example allowing people to treat Wikipedia like Myspace if they agreed to put Google ads on their user pages  Some people wanted to reblock him for this I continually argued against doing so
 He created Obuibo Mbstpo a hoax article about a fictitious Nigerian parliamentarian  When confronted about this he fabricated a source to defend the article  He was blocked again
 He used sockpuppets to evade this ban
 He eventually took responsibility for the hoax article and fabricating the source  Once he did this I advocated  eventually successfully  for his unblock
 Once unblocked he created an article on the Easter bunny hotline a phone number which while existent was clearly nonnotable  He was blocked again as a result  I stated that I considered this block unjustified but that I wasnt going to exert any energy to get him unblocked since I was pretty sure hed created the Easter bunny article in bad faith
 He used socks to evade his blocks
 He expressed an interest in appealing his case to Arb Comm  I told him that if he agreed to edit only the arbitration pages I would unblock him to do so  Moreover I stated that I would advocate for a partial unbanning under those circumstances  He responded to this by declining my offer and continuing to sockpuppet
Its true that hes never actually been disruptive in parliamentary procedure articles at least to my knowledge  I dont care hes clearly here primarily to disrupt and the project needs him gone
