Neanderthal wikipedia entry 

Scott I agree the source provided for the Aborigine origins with Neanderthal man was not conclusive enough so I added more data including DNA evidence which is pretty hard to argue with in the Neanderthal discussion page Hope this clears that issue up for you I look forward to reading your comments in the Neanderthal entry  JettaMann
