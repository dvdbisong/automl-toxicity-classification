Unfair block 

I hope whoever blocked me is watching my talk page It was unfair I was blocked for a personal attack which was simply stating my POV on a users talk page I didnt cuss swear curse use profanity or do the above under any different name I simply said From what I can see of your user page you hardly qualify as a devout Catholic I would like there for to be unblocked immediately and as an aside Ive had worse things said to me  Including Caltons Elton John is coming to destroy your marraige above This is unacceptable
