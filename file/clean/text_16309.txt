Incorrect info

 Following the move the college began to offer a number of Theology and Education
 degrees which were validated by the Council for National Academic Awards the CNAA
 When this was scrapped following the 1992 Education Act the college entered an 
 academic partnership with the University of Oxford allowing Westminster students to 
 read for degrees of the University 

NOTE This is not correct Degrees were those of the University of Oxford until in what many people felt was a singularly illjudged action Westminster parted from the University of Oxford After that the degrees were validated by the CNAA until the union with Oxford Brookes Further academic subjects while linked with Oxford University were far wider than simply Theology and Education 2202552100
