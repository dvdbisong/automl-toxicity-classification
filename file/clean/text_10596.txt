Oppose Woolwich attack is clearly the WPCOMMONAME for this incident In addition any reader who wouldnt recognise 2013 Woolwich attack as referring to this incident is clearly not going to know that DeathMurder of Lee Rigby refers to it either so it offers no advantage on that score Quite the opposite infact  to the uninitiated DeathMurder of Lee Rigby could refer to any number of incidentsmotivesplaces whereas most reasonable people would assume 2013 Woolwich attack refers to some kind of attack in a place called Woolwich that occurred in 2013 which is good enough as a starting point I dont recognise any of the other articles listed above as being about this sort of incident so its hard to put any weight on that argument at all
