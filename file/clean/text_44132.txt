Air cooled radials 

A recent addition uses this source  to claim that the Heron head was invented by Gibson  Heron at the RAE in 1918 Now Heron is an uncommon name Id expect there to be some involvement whether now or later However Im unconvinced that this GibsonHeron head is at all related to the Heron head

The GibsonHeron head is a design for sealing the head of an aircooled radial engine so as to give good thermal transfer and thus avoid valve overheating

The Heron head as used by Jaguar is a design for combustion chambers

Is there really any overlap
