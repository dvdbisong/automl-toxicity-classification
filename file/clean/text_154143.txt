Wiki Code  

It certainly would be a large effort but would it be appropriate to try to place the United States Code into the Wikipedia
Wikipedia would likely be able to keep the United States Code up to date more than the LRC can once it was in place
On the other hand between the LRC site and Thomas its not too difficult to make certain one has the current law and including the US Code would likely consume at least a gigabyte of storage 2101 10 Apr 2005 UTC
