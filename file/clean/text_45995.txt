i agree its a killer poem  i really like both the rhythm of the poem too  the poem can be interpreted in so many different ways  thats how you can tell how great a poem is when there is no one simple clear interpretation  the lay of shallot is totally one of them

there are a tonne of awesome preraphaelite paintings that are entirely based on the lay of shallot poem by alfred tennyson  there are at least four of them by john williman waterhouse and another by william holman hunt which is also excellent  you should take a look at them
