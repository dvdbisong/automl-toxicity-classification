Thats not really long and irrelevant I mean I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things Once he told me a story about myself Im not sure why Id never been told it before by my family but there you go thats families for you  not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family they were quite nice only youd think that theyd tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me

Anyway this story went as follows of course it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead I wont get it absolutely 100 word perfect but Ill get the plot details correct which is all that matters in the long run and in the short run too probably

Once I went to tea with a girl called Sophie to fully appreciate this amusing and I may add most relevant anecdote you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie in fact we were both only four or five at the time these ages are you will no doubt agree far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place Anyway for reasons General McCully couldnt quite remember I was at least ten at the time and being a fairly old man General McCully didnt have a fantastic memory this girl Sophie you may remember  she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions put her spoon in my hair Now at this point in the story you may well be saying to yourself So what But the problem was the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it

So this was as youll no doubt appreciate quite a difficult situation and in the confusion I couldnt help noticing the slightly random and Ill have to admit irrelevant fact that the screws on which Sophies mothers pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead rather than a Phillips screwdriver when I say flathead do not use this term in its most obvious literal definition but as the DIY term in fairly common use

Anyway there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face examining the screws on my hostess mothers pictures and casting dark aspersions and eventually I just walked out and went home all on my own

Now when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General he may not actually be a General the British Army the army in which he had served had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre random and irrelevant term General including MajorGeneral and I dont know if he was simply one of these since theyre usually addressed simply as General as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully

Come to think of it there even used to be a BrigadierGeneral rank and even a weirdsounding CaptainGeneral rank in the British army though I believe the rank of BrigadierGeneral still lives on in the United States Army existing under some obscure weird bizarre random and irrelevant star rating too such as threestar general though this almost certainly speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability isnt the right term for the rank of BrigadierGeneral

Anyway being a busy person I cant waste any more of my valuble time on this unfortunately
