The tank losses extremely biased

The Indian tank losses are exaggerated at atleast 175 tanks this means some Pakistani wants to believe that even more than 200 Indian tanks were destroyed And the Pakistani tanks losses are put at minimal 200 tanks The original source is US library which i dont consider as neutral at all considering the fact that US was a supporter of Pakistan The losses dont reflect the fact that Pakistan lost almost all major battles of Khem Karan PhilloraBurki and even at Chawinda according to pakistan general himself pakistan lost 34 tanksindia claim 57tanks on the other hand Pakistan exaggerate its claim to 120 tanksIndia accept only 29 tanks more importantly at Khem Karan and Phillora Indian army put on display some 100 tanks at khem karan and 58 tanks at phillora then how is it that pakistan losses are mere 200 and Indian losses Atleast 175 a complete lie 

Spencer C Tucker one of the most renowned military historian puts pakistan losses at 300 tanksIndian claimed 494 tanks and Indian losses at 150 tanksPakistan claimed 290tanks

All the Indian editors plz focus on this the neutral losses are represnted by US figures which i think are biased and further Spencer C Tucker is also one of the most renowned historian  even Stanley Wolpart and Jeremy Black made it clear that at the end of war Indian Army has Twice the number of tanksPakistan started with more tanks when war started

All the Indian editors must raise this issue as some pakistani editors think that by peddling lies they will win the 1965 war
