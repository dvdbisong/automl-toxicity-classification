Soviet War Memorial Treptower Park 

Hi there in regards to Soviet War Memorial Treptower Park please do not reinsert that information into the article as it fails verification The source which was used states

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police The victims themselves were permanently traumatised women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist

It does not state WHICH memorial and the inclusion in this article represents original research As a Berliner you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material and reinsert it into the article I will present evidence which proves that 1 they have not read the material at all or 2 have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it This has been raised on the talk page and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources this is egregious original research and given the nature of the information inserted it can be seen as a blatant breach of WPDIGWUREN I would suggest that you not reinsert as you will not want to get caught up in this The next person to reinsert it will be reported to WPAE  Dialogue
