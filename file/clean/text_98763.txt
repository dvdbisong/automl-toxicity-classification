Care to google for at least 5 minutes before throwing tags Within 3 minutes I found the citation is quoted from 
I Nistor Basarabia 101990 p159 
Ion Nistor was a chief ideologue of Greater Romanian nationalism in the early 20th century and in the interbellum and a fierce Ukrainophobe You can read more on him in the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine as well as here in Chernivtsi University and Rumanization articles The info in the statement is indeed dubious but the quote itself is taken from a historians work Please stop abusing tags Nistor while biased in interpretations is an academic sholar and can be reasonably trusted on facts themselves This is a too easy and lazy approach At least care to look for the info before disrupting the articles and the other peoples work with your tags
