Spelling 

Hi Richard Great to see you helping to correct spelling mistakes However you should be aware of WikipediaManual of StyleNational varieties of English An article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular Englishspeaking nation should use the English of that nation This includes differences in spelling between US English and other varieties of English ie US center Brit centre US organization Brit organisation etc A comprehensive list of differences can be found at American and British English spelling differences Note that Australian and New Zealand articles largely follow British English spelling too Cheers
