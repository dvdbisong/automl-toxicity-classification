Speculation about what hasnt been shown on TV before  I assume you mean brushing his teeth on ESPN  This is entirely true  It aired on one of the 2003 WSOP broadcasts  Here is a link so some vidcaps of the segment httpimagesgooglecomimgresimgurlhttpwwwpokerplayerseimagesphiljpgimgrefurlhttpwwwpokerplayerseidolbilderhtmh240w352sz69tbnidh2RiDQfTIXcJtbnh79tbnw116hlenstart90previmages3Fq3Dphil2Bhellmuth2B26start3D8026svnum3D1026hl3Den26lr3D26sa3DN

I am saddened that you people insist on censoring objective truth  Its downright disgusting  If you insist on removing my edit simply because you do not have a full recollection of what has and what has not appeared on TV then be ready for an all out war  I declare war on censor  You are either with us or youre against us
