Thanks for the input I will correct the URLs and the terminology tomorrow I was under the impression Solus Operating System was a Linux distro and not to be confused with what has a page on here called SolusOS  are you that same project If not which I think is the case I can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article blanking this one called Solus Operating System so long as that is available If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article Ill gladly comply with your wish Some organizations don t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons Anyway I am enjoying your OS If you get around to it could explain to me what makes Solus its own OS rather than a Linux distro Also I understood that although you use Budgie Gnome is behind it When I look at details in Solus it says Gnome 3xx     Also my name is being changed to SpiffyAnarchist fyi
