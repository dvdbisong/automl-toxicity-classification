Addressing
Id just call this section Opinion or Decision and toss of the court JMO I wont kick if you want to keep it  
 per WPSCOTUSSG  Boomer  
Photos of Souter and Rehnquist are sandwiching the text which I hear is the worst wikicrime you can possibly commit  snark  Maybe right justify Souter and bump Rehnquist down to the dissent section and leftjustify his image
 per WPSCOTUSSG  Boomer  
and you should expand the dissent a bit too its sketchy  
Im going to read the actual decision before I comment further on this section but while you are doing a copyedit remember to either expand or merge your onesentence paragraphs  
But until then IMHO consider that the GA should perhaps be longer than the syllabus of the case itself    Just saying   
Consider expanding the Subsequent developments subsection into a full section and discuss the impact of the case
