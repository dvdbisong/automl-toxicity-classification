Going by the chart at WPCANVASS I limited the scale to those users who had already contributed to that thread phrased the notice as neutrally as my wordsmithing abilities would allow and left a comment at the primary discussion that I had done so Craftyminion left a comment at that thread at 0150 20091110 server time If I omitted anyone please let me know or notify them yourself
