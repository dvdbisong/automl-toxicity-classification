Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings

I would like to mention that I added 0 of the OR tags and thus am innocent I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise it is easier to blame both sides for a conflict However on closer inspection I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wikipolicies and outside sources while JJB is using scorchedEarth tactics Please consider this example

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move for compliances sake in some other polite way First the vote remains 64 by my count no consensus Second your unsourced statement of thousands of longevity myths cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs 91 Third this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of myth mirrors stem from Ryoungs wholly unsourced 2005 insertions The UserShiiHoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing See User talkShiiHoaxesLongevity ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions

            Yet another FALSE accusation There is no hoaxing here at all nor has there been any attempt at hoaxing I am not responsible for thirdparty sites but if they choose to copy my work might it be because they consider it a reliable sourceRyoung122 

                Comment Looking closer we see that it was JJB that listed this as a hoax

Citation of ones own accusation is a circular argument and thus invalid

In other words JJBulten first adds material to Shis page then cites his own add as proof of hoaxing Actually its only proof of his fanaticism of hitting below the belt in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image
