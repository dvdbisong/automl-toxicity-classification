How could it be affirmed that the majority of the public know the names from the Funimation broadcast Is there any source stating that Even if that were true Dragon Ball is known in almost all the Englishspeaking world not only in the US And thats not including the rest of the world More importantly the manga is the primary work and normally the main source for most information regarding a work of fiction its the printed work like most American comicbook characters like Superman Batman Wolverine etc
These are the key phrases to decide what names to use
WPENGLISH
Use the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject as the title of the article as you would find it in verifiable reliable sources for example other encyclopedias and reference works I honestly dont think that reliable sources will be found about this topic at least not like encyclopedias and reference works which leaves us with the following policy
WPMOSAM
Characters should be identified by the names used in the official English releases of the series If there are multiple English releases such as both a manga and anime use the one that is best known and that has contributed most to the works becoming known in the Englishspeaking world usually the primary work This is the key one We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the Englishspeaking world In my opinion it was the manga since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it and in the US the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying But again this is not definitive We need the opinions of people from other Englishspeaking countries in order to have a more accurate perception
If we want accuracy which is also desirable by other Wikipedia policies we should use the romanizations given by the author Toriyama in his Japanese works and then include the alternatives as stated in WPENGLISH After all most guidelines arent meant to be a strict rule But for the moment first we have to define which one manga or anime helped more in making Dragon Ball known in the Englishspeaking world And remember US TV is not the whole Englishspeaking world And if we go by the primary work its manga
