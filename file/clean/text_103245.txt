Irredentist edits in Wikipedia pages 

I found several innovations and new WIKI rules applied by some users that violates the normal comportament of editors 
These estonishing edits were made by some editors who managed to block all oponents using gang tactics and misinformation of administrators

All these edits show the real character of the editor named Borsoka He is considered as an irredentist editor by Romanians Ukrainian and Serb editors

Amazing reasons to erase Romanian references and Romanian historians text
1 Book before WW 2   
2 Non English reference    
3 Scholars view  and not scholars argumentation here original research of Borsoka
4 There is no need to add scholars POV of their opponents but in his Hungarian history pages there are a lot of such opinions
5 Stupid approach   new original research of Borsoka about Romanian references
6 Specialists are not Hungarians 

Also the user Fakirbakir erased several Romanian references because he considered 
that he personally disagree the opinions of the Romanian author and if he disagrees an author here about Georgescu a historian he erases it from WIKI pages

httpsenwikipediaorgwikiTalkOrigin_of_the_Romanians  section Georgescus statement
I have to disagree with Georgescus statement

There is a simple explanation of these amazing innovations and new Wikipedia rules
The two editors Borsoka and Fakirbakir act as a gang against editors from neighboring countries and act alternatively to avoid the 3RR rule and to eliminate
single editors Their scope to emphasize the priority in history of Hungarians this is a part of the definition of IRREDENTISM to show the priority in history against neigbouring countries

All these reasons made the mentioned history article to be of very bad quality due to irredentist edits Some Romanian journals wrote about these activities in the Wikipedia pages and so Wikipedia is considered as an unreliable source for history due to these amazing edits Unfortunately no administrator acted against these tactics
I mentioned you the vandalism in the mentioned pages but no result
