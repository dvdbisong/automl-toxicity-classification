Ethnicnationality descent categories
Hi Mayumashu In the past I know you did a tremendous amount of work on the subcategories of  As you probably know Ive been proposing renames for a bunch of these to conform to the FOOian people standard Now Im not sure how you feel about these changes but I was wondering  If I come across one of these categories that are named FOOs of GOOian descent and I see that you are the creator and sole author would I have your permission to speedily rename these to FOOian people of GOOian descent It would save me having to do a formal discussion for them and would help us regain consistency faster If you disagree with these changesIm sorry and you dont have to say yes  talk 
No no that s fine  go for it GoodOlfactory  And for the ones where I haven t been sole author I ll gladly support each of your noms  All the best
