UnblockIll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine

1 Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the IPeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing

2 For exampleand this is yep maybe you guessed it question 2 Why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name like say escape orbit to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because Im just a lowly IPeditor Specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebaY logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because I wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid

3 Heres another one Why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when I say their reversions are vandalism I get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because Im an IPonly editor

4 Ready for one more Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IPeditors a warning template but when I as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl I get dinged with Oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or Oh thats bad because thats harassment 

5 Oh yeah heres one more Remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking 3RR that says that  but I was right so I was not editwarring is no defense Well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give herhim a pass anyway but when I an IPonly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingrightmatchingconsensusisnodefense rule
