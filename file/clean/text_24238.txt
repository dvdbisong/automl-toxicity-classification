Can we get a final answer on aquatic creatures 

Ok I though all of the spore creatures were terrestrial but I saw what I believe to be a recent demo where the player was playing the creature phase underwater His creature had fins and could swim pretty fast then gave his creature 3 legs and walked out onto the land  The demo then went on to discuss the remaining phases of the game  The video was about 30 minutes long and I believe it was secretly leaked from a an apple store  Other highlights including the creatures jumping up and down with excitement whenever an item was purchased in the tribal stage and the player losing a war in the civilization stage but still skipping ahead to space 20810610440
