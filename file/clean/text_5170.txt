Any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism For example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism  its just not helpful and should be removed or restated Not all vandalism is obvious nor are all massive or controversial changes vandalism Careful attention needs to be given to whether changes made are beneficial detrimental but well intended or outright vandalism
