I feel no strong urge to make a change The source does say bug and not insect Technically I see nothing wrong with saying insect because a bug is a type of insect Both would be factually accurate according to the source I do imagine your suspicion is correct but neither you or I were there and it very well could have been a bug even if an insect is a more likely situation to have happened I think this is a case where the saying wikipedia is not interested in what is true but what is verifiably true I think bug is more shocking in a hook to my ears which makes it preferable in a hook Best
