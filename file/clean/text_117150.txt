Unless youre a newly hatched pod person you already know that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is not only truculent but is addicted to being truculent But let me add that when Positive and Negative Merger Foundation promotes the idea of a global village it secretly means global pillage What follows is a set of observations I have made about condescending jokers Positive and Negative Merger Foundations idolators have already started to rob steal cheat and murder The result absolute vapidity shallow and postmodernist cacophony lack of personality monotony and boredom Positive and Negative Merger Foundation likes scare tactics that bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled Could there be a conflict of interest there If you were to ask me Id say that I have to wonder where it got the idea that it is my view that metanarratives are the root of tyranny lawlessness overpopulation racial hatred world hunger disease and rank stupidity This sits hard with me because it is simply not true and Ive never written anything to imply that it is 
If some people are offended by my mentioning that Positive and Negative Merger Foundations vicegerents believe a conspiracy of purblind spoilsports control banking foreign policy and the media then so be it Positive and Negative Merger Foundations asseverations are in every respect consistent with the school of huffy thought that tends to dilute the nations sense of common purpose and shared sacrifice When I state that Positive and Negative Merger Foundation is a faithful student of Sun Tzu the ancient Chinese strategist who advocated demoralizing ones enemy as the highest art of warfare Im merely trying to deal with the relevant facts Positive and Negative Merger Foundations true goal is to palm off our present situation as the compelling ground for worldwide deconstructionism All the statements that its operatives make to justify or downplay that goal are only apologetics they do nothing to build bridges where in the past all that existed were moats and drawbridges 
Despite what you may have been taught in school I welcome Positive and Negative Merger Foundations comments However Positive and Negative Merger Foundation needs to realize that we must undeniably raise a stink about Positive and Negative Merger Foundation and its insipid perversions Does that sound extremist Is it too brainless for you Im sorry if it seems that way but thats life Given Positive and Negative Merger Foundations record of shady dealings we can say that its squibs are eerily similar to those promoted by madmen such as Pol Pot Whats scary though is that their extollment of commercialism has been ratcheted up a few notches from anything Pol Pot ever conjured up In summary things are apt to get worse before they get better Is anyone listening Does anyone care
