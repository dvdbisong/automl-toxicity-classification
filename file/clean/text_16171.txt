Say Tim could you take a look at  

 the Excommunication article  particularly the amishmennonite sections  this same anonymous IP editor has been trying to do the same to the Mennonite article  heshe is obsessed and persistent  i certainly think there should be some discussion of the pathological use of The Ban you might find in really conservative menno and amish congregations but this stuff is far from representative of the denomination
