If you want to claim POV good faith obliges you to specify your claims on the discussion pages for the article Im afraid you arent going to substantiate these changes by claiming that ADL and Lipstadt are inherently POV nor are you going to succeed in claiming that it is inherently POV to say Irving was discredited You have contributed nothing to the discussion on the article and cannot expect a great deal of credibility without making arguments on the discussion pages to back edits that are contrary to evident consensus apparent on the discussion pages
