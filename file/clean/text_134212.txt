I am completely convinced now You are most certainly a paid propagandist whos sole goal on wikipedia is the integral protection of Yugoslavs and Yugoslav historiography Hilariously enough one needs to spend years studying the complexity of NDH in order to get the correct picture  what you do not have and will never have because of your balkan irrationality and politically fueled interest in such a topic and the surrounding topics I really do wish I had the time and energy to flip this all around site sources  and become more familiar with wikipedia itself  but I do not I have trumped you in almost every single section of argument  point for point But you still continue and you have even removed things that I have written on discussion pages within long periods of time where I am not visibly present I would probably do the same if someone like myself was embarrassing me intellectually in the way that I embarrass you Stipe Mesic used NDH rhetoric several times in several countries to benefit his and the HDZs political platform If you are going to sit here and say that the memory of NDH had nothing to do with the creation of the modern Croatian state  well then youre lying to yourself and everyone else The entire political emigration was founded upon the tradition of NDH The modern wave of Croatian nationalism was the idea of national reconciliation between sons of Ustase and Partizani Thats in HDZs original political platform Tudman had to appeal to all Croatians  thats why you Tito lovers got to parade around with the false idea of antifascism at a time when the Croatian lobby couldnt combat 60 years of communist propaganda and the Serb wartime propaganda machine that was screaming  Tudman  Pavelic look at the flag look at the currency I personally witnessed Stipe Mesic playing the NDH card He is an opportunist He was even caught singing Jure i Boban Coincidence   Of course not It was to his political benefit He also left Tudmans side to shake hands with Croatias political right in their smear campaign against Tudman himself Thats right Stipe Mesic at HSP rallies years before Anto Djapic and the HSP denounced the Ustasa Movement or Dr Pavelic Look at Djapic now Theres another great example 15 years ago he was Ustasa number one In recent years European pressure has made it unfavorable  so now he sings a different tune Thats the best part All these people are the biggest balkan chameleons who use these catch themes to fool all the little balkanites into ignoring real problems in the country That is how NDH is relevant However your side has done so well in the creation of this socalled antifascism that proNDHers if you will can only fight back by pointing out communist crimes Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg isnt really Jasenovac Vs Bleiburg its Ustasa historiography Vs Partizan historiography Most people in Croatia sympathize with one side or the other  you know that and I know that You can sit here and throw out fallacies fact is fact Stipe Mesic at one point in time glorified the tenth of April and sang Ustasa songs That is a fact Dr Pavelic was allied with the Axis that is a fact He later in his emigre days distanced himself and his movement from the Nazis and formed a Croatian Democratic movement HOP Theyre politicians
