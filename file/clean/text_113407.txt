This page is majorly biased 
This page has a negative bias toward Stormfont For example it labels the website as a hate site and neonazi forum Although it is possible that some Stormfront members would characterized their views as hate and neoNazi it is doubtful that many or most would do so It is not appropriate to cite sources like the SPLC or ADL in the article since they are not neutral sources It makes just as much sense to use the  ADL as a source in the Stormfront article as it does to use Stormfront as a source in the Holocaust article Having a controversy section is not appropriate in this or any other article It is not encyclopedic Wikipedia should stick to reporting the facts not other organizations opinions or suppositions
