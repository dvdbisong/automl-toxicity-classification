Thanks you for the comment I have missed that other link and will now go and remove that one too Wikipedia is not a mere list of links and external links should ideally be tied into relevant mentions within the text see WPNOT If you feel that the language school link is justified then why not add a short section mentioning Chesters growing role as a center where NnonEngloish speaking students can learn English The link might be justifiable then but realise that favouring one language school over another would not be a good idea Â talk
