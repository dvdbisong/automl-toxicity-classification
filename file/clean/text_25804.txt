Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea
I note that you began this article However the SC of PNG is not actually a separately constituted court like the Full Courts of the Supreme Courts the Australian States and formerly of the Supreme Courts of the Canadian Provinces before the creation of the provincial Courts of Appeal early in the 20th century it is an ad hoc tribunal consisting of judges of the National Court who are empanelled from time to time to hear specific appeals and references The Chief Justice and the Registrar are of the Supreme and National Courts the puisne justices are not actually referred to as justices of the Supreme Court This article should really be renamed Supreme and National Courts of Papua New Guinea since discussion of the work of the SC in an article of its own is somewhat artificial given that it is actually an appellate committee I alas dont know how to do this Can you manage it
