 Transactional and transformational leadership 

Dear Synchronism I would be happier if next time you research a little bit more on the notability of the articles youre proposing to delete before tagging them Both theories are widely known among the leadership scholars and a google or google scholar search would sufice Also it helps if you check the history page There was some indication that some sort of bibliography existed before in transformational leadership as the years were cited after the authors In a couple of clicks you could have discovered the bibliography that was deleted by some editor in the past Happy edits   

A google hit count is not the same as a corpus token count Anyway ghits and corpus tokens dont equate notability  I clearly have different opinions on this subject than you so Id appreciate it if you wouldnt conflate those differences with any complaints you have about my editting activity  You responded to my proposed deletions sufficiently and then some And for the record I do look at page histories

Budgie TV series
Are you a lawyer by any chance Having tidied up some appallingly written text in the article Budgie TV series it seems you have reverted it back on some minor technicality If you arent a lawyer I suggest you contact the Department of Justice as they are looking for people just like you  Preceding unsigned comment added by 9286813   

You removed referenced text from the article without explanation  Ill happily restore your reversions partially but do not remove substantial text without explanation  

 Parapsychology is a pseudoscience and you guys are promoting it as science 

Cluebot reverted my edits removing unreliable sourcing on that article Now when I try to point out it is a pseudoscience you revert my edits again All you are are a bunch of frauds who want to promote ignorance and superstition Why else would you revert edits which call a pseudoscience for what it is  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs   TemplateUnsigned  
Having not ever read the article I wouldnt know if its promoting anything I reverted your edits because you removed the bulk of the articles text and replaced it with a comment that would have been more useful on the articles talk page As far as the bots actions are concerned I support it The references obviously dont by themselves make anything true but it least we know where its coming from You could always just undo the bots edits
