Help me identify a vandal 

On your RfA page I see that you are interested in blocking vandals On that same page on March 17 you forgot to log in once and corrected yourself Your IP address from this mistake was revealed to be 691824834 On March 28 someone from that IP address added a note on User_talk691824834 saying that it is registered to Canterbury High School Connecticut and is shared by multiple users The note was added because this address was guilty of previous vandalisms This information is confirmed by a dnsstuffcom lookup Canterbury High School is a private boarding school with about 220 students boarding there My problem is this on February 12 someone from that IP address entered the new email address for WikipediaWatchorg on numerous ecommerce lists so that the box would be flooded with spam I believe that if this person was not you then you at least know who did it Out of 220 students how many hang out on Wikipedia Im asking you to identify this vandal What this vandal did is technically a felony As far as I know Wikimedia Foundation does not condone felonies
