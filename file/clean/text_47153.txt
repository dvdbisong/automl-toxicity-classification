PrinceDuchess of Cambridge 

Because the child is a boy and because the Duke of Cambridges second title is the Earl of Strathearn we now know that the new baby is HRH The Earl of Strathearn since he takes his fathers next title by courtesy just as other heirs to British Dukes do so the title of the article should be HRH The Earl of Strathearn and it should also be noted in the section about his Title and Style 31109139238  
Dukes heir uses a courtesy title only if he have no title by own right Now he is Prince george of Cambridge he dont need a courtesy title If Prince William predesease his father the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc
eg George V s third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry The Duke of Gloucester Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden his heirsfirst Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster But Present Duke prince Richards children dont have princely titls because they are kings great grand childrenOnly Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden  

When the child has been born assuming we dont know the given name immediately should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news so we should probably be prepared for that I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine Duchess of CambridgePregnancy I have just edited them to redirect here instead Online 
No that would not be right The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge ie that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Princess X of Cambridge It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named the present title certainly wont become less accurate or less precise once the childis born   

The child will be officially entitled Prince Name of Cambridge or Princess Name of Cambridge So probably not  Want to have a chat 
Princess NN of Cambridge would be the best answer but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway theres no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name In other cases ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium the article Princess NN of SwedenBelgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced But this article is already in place so moving it only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless   
Personally I think Norman is a great name for a Prince although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it  
I agree with Morhange Additionally we might not be certain as to the childs precise style until one is used styles have broken precedent before remember so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG BD 

The style of the boy is given as His Royal Highness Prince name of Cambridge on the official webpages of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge  so speculation about that can now end wwwdukeandduchessofcambridgeorgnewsanddiarytheduchessofcambridgehasbeendeliveredofson
