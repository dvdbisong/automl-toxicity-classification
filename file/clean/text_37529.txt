FYI about what RAID stands for 

Welcome to Wikipedia I noticed your recent edit to RAID in which you changed the definition of the term from Inexpensive to Independent Please be aware that this has been the source of an edit war not too long ago There is a  talk page thread concerning this very thing and there is another thread explaining why Independent does not describe RAID at all The use of the word Inexpensive is backed up by reliable sources so please do not change it again Thank you
