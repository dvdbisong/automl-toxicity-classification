I just wanted to ask why doesnt this say anything about the arrest or abuse that took place at WMA  Several arrest were made amongst those in the adminstration of this school  People ended up in the witness protection program as a result of some of the crimes that took place at this school  How is there nothing mentioning the drug trafficing solicitation of prostitution and physical abuse and neglect that took place at this school  I wish scars were a resource because I still have those left over from Wentworth even though it is seven years later
