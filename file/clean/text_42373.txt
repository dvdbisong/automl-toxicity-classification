The wording of the most recent edit is needs tweaking Reading the source provided Hunter wrote in opposition of a complete withdrawal of US forces an unreliable Afghan Leadership concerns regarding roadside bombs and what he saw as Obama administrations other shortcomings which he termed mixed messages to American service members and the world And as stated by the Administration in 2012 there are were no plans for a complete withdraw which had changed as recently as recently as this month to possible withdrawal after 2014 Therefore upon closer review the summarization of the source is wrong
As for the second part I would say the best way to word it would be something like

So in the end I am proposing the following wording
