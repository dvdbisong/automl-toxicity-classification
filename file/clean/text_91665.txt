OneactFulllength 

A previous editor contended that a oneact play could not be fulllength  This is a confusion of the two very different terms  Being presented in one act only means that the play has no internal act breaks and is presented without an intermission  A oneact play could be a shorter work and often is but in the case of Vogels play this is not the case  Christmas Ride is also a fulllength work running about 140   Christmas Ride is thus both fulllength AND oneact much like say Irwin Shaws Bury the Dead another elegiac oneact fulllength play  Preserving this distinction is important
