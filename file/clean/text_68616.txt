I understand your point but this isnt a local anomaly Were talking about the cut and dry first cotton mill in America If this was the first Ma and Pops Hoagie shop well then yes that would be in a local context but this is a national to international matter of relevance This is not a regional interest topic The BCM is extremely notable and worth mentioning in this article If you want to subdivide the article into pieces based on regionality then lets create a Cotton Mills in America article and put the BCM at the top of the list

As far as Slaters history is concerned there was a progression between animal and water powered production I dont have the information on any other animal powered production facilities but you mention that you found two or three references to animal power in 1400 Why not add them Theyre part of history Perhaps the framework of your date titling system in Cotton Mill is rubbish and needs to be changed because no matter what stance we take here the article is clearly missing information that could be incorporated Providing only the information there allows people to make incorrect inferences

In the context of Cotton Mill are we to add an animalpowered category or are we going to omit that from history The Water powered section is nice but we should show a greater view of earlier mills both in America and across the seas Dont hold back now you appear to have more information about other mills Add that information please
