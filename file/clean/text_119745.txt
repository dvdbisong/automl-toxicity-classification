Inappropriate block 
For anyone reading this page who is curious about the situation
 I have been blocked unfairly and indefinitely for not being here to create an encyclopedia despite the fact that I have created dozens of articles and been a civil and constructive Wikipedian with over a thousand edits
 I have been making good faith efforts to work through the Wikipedia dispute resolution process without result
 I have been called names I have been accused of perpetrating a scam I have been accused of lying and I have been accused of not being who I say I am  I have therefore created a webpage which will hopefully clarify this matter which can be seen here  httpwwwelonkacomwikipedia
 There is a discussion about the matter going on at the Admin noticeboard  Interested parties are invited to comment I would also appreciate if someone could please post my new URL there Thank you
