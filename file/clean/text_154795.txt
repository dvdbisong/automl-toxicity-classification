An apology 

In the heat of the moment last night while doing my best to educate some wilfully ignorant vexatious POV pushers I inadvertently deleted an entry about me from ANI That was completely unintentional and I apologise I actually realised my mistake within seconds but couldnt fix it because I had been blocked by what must be one of Wikipedias most trigger happy Admins I note this is given as part of the reason for my block Its an unreasonable part I made a mistake and wasnt given time to fix it 

This isnt an appeal to have my block lifted Just a hope that some sanity will prevail and the reason for my block will be changed Right now I have little interest in being part of a community that encourages wilful ignorance POV pushing edit warring and harassment by blocking someone trying to discourage such behaviour
