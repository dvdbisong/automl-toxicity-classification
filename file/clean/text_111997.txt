Hi Jerzy  I looked at TalkIsaac Fanous and I thought what if some newbie comes along and wants to start editing the article and writing notes on the talk page  He might be confused by the Please do not edit this page warning

As far as policy goes see the deletion process section Votes for Deletion page step 5b  But I guess you already know about that as you edited that page last August before I had even heard of VfD

It isnt something I feel strongly about if I was overly bold sorry    talk 1435 9 Feb 2005 UTC
