I dont think so itll revert back

I see it has been reverted back and then back again whie I was blocked citing sockpuppetry a little bit hard since I was blocked lol He haqs not even discussed his changes here so rather than just enter a pointless edit war ill drop a line by an admin and see if we can get this sorted out  is obviously trying to make a WPPOINT however he has already been warned about this dispute
