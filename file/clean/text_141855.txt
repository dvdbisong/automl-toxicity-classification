Hey  I really appreciate the excellent work you have done expanding Cuisine of Cambodia The article looks much better now than it did a couple of weeks ago I just wanted to tell you a couple of things The beautiful image of num bachok that you have been trying to add to the article is taken from this site  If you look at the bottom of that page you can see the the website is copyright This means that Wikipedia cannot use the image in the Encyclopedia without getting in trouble If you have a picture of num bachok that you have taken and would like to allow Wikipedia to use freely you can upload it here  Then see WikipediaPicture tutorial for instructions on how to add your image to the article

The second thing is that Ive edited out two lines from the article about people in Phnom Penh your text said
Many of the Khmers who knew how to cook authentic Khmer cuisine before the civil war were killed during the Khmer Rouge Regime Very few Cambodians know how to cook real Khmer cuisine If you visit Phnom Penh today the Khmer food now tastes more like Thai because the people of Phnom Penh came from refugee camps so did not know the real features of authentic of Khmer cuisine

The first part maybe true  because so many people were killed during the KR regime However the next two lines are only an opinion and probably not true so I have removed them If you can find a reliable source that says those things then you should add the text back to the article with a reference to the source

Thanks again for expanding the article with so much good information about tasty Khmer food  I love it too
