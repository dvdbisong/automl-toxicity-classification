Hello  Wow you have done alot of work here  Goodstuff  As you can see for some reason this ATRIAN has been following me from article to article vadalizing them and just beeing an all around pain in the bum  I dont mean to break the rules in anyway and ill be more careful next time  However i would appreciate if this ATRAIN would find himself someone also to follow around and bother  Ive only been a WIKI member for 4 days and already this doosh bag has some kind of beef with me  I DONT APPRECIATE him using my NAME on his post  The topic of the article would have done just fine  But you can see what im talkin about when i say doosh bag  The man thinks hes got the right to go around and pick on people  
PS  ATRIAN  Please STOP useing my NAME in your comments  And stop following me around  Sure ill make mistakes im not a pro writer  But if Atrian likes to hear himself talk so much he should find someone who cares about what hes saying  I hope im not offending you  But like i said ive been a memeber for 34 days and this guy is been leaving me nasty comments since the first article i posted  Thanks  I also wonder how Atrian knows that i didnt have promision to use that text   Wouldnt it be possible that i know the webmaster that wrote it for the goverment page that i copied it from  WHat reasearch has he done into this  The man is a panzy  And he was the first to send me a nasty comment  I belive i have the right to defend my self   Thank you
