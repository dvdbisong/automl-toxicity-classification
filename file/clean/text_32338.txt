Providencereligious movement 

Hi Stephen
This is Gios sorry to bug you again Just had a short question in regards to the Providencereligious movement page Btw thank you for your help in recent months several of the authors of the page have been helpful and engaging in meaningful discussions

Short question I know that we are supposed to use care when dealing with primary sources in the case of this article the subject has published several books himself that detail some of his spiritual teachings I was wondering if we can use these and if you have any advice for doing so in a way that remains unbiased and neutral 

Again thank you
