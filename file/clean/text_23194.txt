Hope the picture is clearer This page currently focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good although I prefer Islamic slave trade  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa  The first is an invention theres no books about the African slave trade Davidsons book of that title is about the Atlantic Slave Trade and probably a POV title This is not to deny an indigenous practice or trade in slaves for much of history but simply that the focus on African slave trade is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic Much of its content has long standing tags some very problematic sources and POV writing style  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions but needs some heft and a title change  In terms of content overlap there is some significant content overlap between African slave trade with both Slavery in Africa and Atlantic slave trade largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered  Most of the other pages refer to each other but content does not appear to overlap Idea for reorganization Ill expand this to more editors but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first 1 African slave trade page gets merged into Slavery in Africa or other pages as appropriate 2 Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa as more appropriate 3 Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic that stays with the slave trade pages themselves 4 A new article on Emancipation movements in Africa or something needs to be created It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended but then glossed over entirely by other pages Any thoughts on this organization
