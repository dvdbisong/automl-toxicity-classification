Great discussion point Jimbo although I dont think discussion is actually required the foundation should be able to just do this without the support of the users that are disputing the edits In really difficult disputed issues I agree the wikimedia Foundation could hire experienced editors although I wouldnt support any wikipedia connected interviewers use and pay someone totally independent  independent notable reporters to interview and report on the problematic content issue and report that in a wprs source thus giving full independent closure to the dispute
