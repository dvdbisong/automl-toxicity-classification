OK thats promising  I cant find anything online but if you have sources for it having had a market and a fair they can go in the Liphook article and we then have some evidence for Liphook being a town  Whether or not one page on Hampshire County Councils website calls Liphook a town is irrelevant its unsourced and plenty of other pages on their site refer to it as a village  If you have some specific places in mind on this list which dont fit the criteria then by all means lets look at them but Basingstoke Milton Keynes and Eastleigh fall into the generally referred to as a town category so should be included under current guidelines  talk
