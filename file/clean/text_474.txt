Thanks 

Thanks for the thanks I just leave them in my watchlist after I found an archive full of vandalism a while back Given that it was slashdotted I suspect we will see a bit more of it I might get someone else to fully protect it if it continues I cant do it because of COI I would also like to thank you for keeping an open mind Changing votes is an encouraging sign of Good Faith Regards
