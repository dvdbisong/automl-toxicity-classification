I added rows to the popular vote table to reflect the estimate that 173368 of Michigans uncommitted voters favored Obama according to the exit polls  Thats just under 73  The source is cited but Im just using a source already cited previously in the article  I think this number is especially important as its the most accurate guess we have about how many of those who voted uncommitted in Michigan would have voted for Obama if his name had been on the ticket  It helps answer the question Of all those who actually voted who did they mean to vote for Sorry I forgot to login before making the change
