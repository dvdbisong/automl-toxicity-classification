Hello I understand you do your best to follow Wikipedia policies while editing this article and several of your edits are useful but I would still encourage you to be more careful in your editing and maybe stop editing the article and rather make suggestions at the articles talk page Your edits about the reform may be a bit too detailed and also a bit too nice English Wikipedia generally discourages people from editing articles on subjects they are closely related to and in particular paid editing like editing from your employee If you edit the article too much you are at risk that the article may be tagged for Conflict of Interest editing which is not good for publicity I understand you have good intentions of editing within policies and Wikipedias policy regarding Conflict of Interest editing gives a bit mixed signals but the safest thing is not too edit the articles the second safest is to only add very basic information change in personel etc Best regards
