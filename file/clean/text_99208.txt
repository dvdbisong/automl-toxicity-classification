Sorry I removed it again before seeing the above The problem is the source doesnt actually make any sense This sort of thing usually comes via a mayors office or some similar representative body That the source which seems pretty poor anyway ascribes it to the residents of the place is crap journalism Did each resident write one letter in the document or what Were the residents even consulted by whoever actually wrote it It is maudlin BS at present sorry
