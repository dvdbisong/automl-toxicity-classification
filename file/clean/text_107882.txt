I asked you for a rationale not a url link Im very aware that there are a lot of idiots or militants around on the internet and they probably dont know that the laicit√© concept has since its beginning been openly directed against the catholic church which was thought to be way too much powerful at that time 1905 The law about religious symbols in school although badly written the proposal was to ban all religious symbols in primary and secondary schools is a direct application of this one centuryold philosophy as written in the constitution so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it This law that you call the French Hijab ban neither concerns only the Hijab nor is a ban of the Hijab in general I see Hijab every day when I go back to France Also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false or very rare

So its law on secularism and an alleged example of islamophobia for some islamic militantsmultcularism proponents in the USUK and does absolutely not match the sentance above  Islamophobic incidences are a fact just like antisemitic acts

For the point 2 and 3 I appreciate your POV but its only that
