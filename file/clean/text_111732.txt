Alawis 
hello im new to this and dont quite no how i would send you a message through this 
but how would we be able to discuss the Alawi page 
i found some things that you were tryin to explain be incorrect Every Alawi person i no Woships the Imam Ali in the Shia way and worship all of the Prophet Mohammads family and the we worship both the Prophet Mohammad and the Imam Ali and follow both their teaching we do not just follow the Imam Ali teachings we follow the Prophets as well Alawi int he past 50 years have become closer to Shia and do not celebrate Christmas Or any other Christian Eids I know from me and my family we celebrate all Shia Eids and for Ramadan nearly every year we choose to fast And yes our teachings are kept private not secrete Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs   
Well we should probably discuss this on the talk page on the Alawi article but anyway I believe the Alawite beliefs vary quite a bit my family do for example celebrate Christmas and other Christian festivals but they are Lebanese so they may have retained more of the original Alawite beliefs than the ones in Syria who try harder to be accepted as true Muslims so that the validity of Bashar Assads presidency isnt questioned    

My family is Alawi and we celebrate the Shia Eids We dont celebrate Christmas how can we when we dont believe the story of the 3 wise men ad we dont believe in Joseph to Muslims Marry wasnt married and God had sent Zacaria to guard heret c 
The part about How we Worship the Imam Al to Alawi we follow both Teachings of the Imam Ali and the Prophet Mohammad None of them come first in your case your kinda saying that Ali comes first before the prophet Alawi only have the Quran and their own scriputres as Islamic text And iv read from other websites that Aparantly Alawi worship the Imam ALi like a God when we dont When you are trying to Explain the Trinity thing your as basicly saying that we belive Ali is God in 3 forms which complely contridicts the point of us being Muslim That there is no one but Allah and there is only One god and he has no sons etc And we believe in Rencarnation as is And your should say that when the boys study the Alawi text you should say after 1516 boys can choose to go deeper into the relgion and study more or choose not to study more i no from my grandfather he went deep into the relgion and spent his whole life studying it Where as my dad stoped when he got married and had kids so around 22 
Well I didnt write the article and Im not sure who added the trinity stuff but if it isnt sourced it probably shouldnt be there As for beliefs well as I mentioned before the Alawites in Syria have changed their beliefs to become more like mainstream Muslims so many of the older traditions might not be practiced there Its different in Lebanon though where the Syrian government is unable to regulate the sects like in Syria
