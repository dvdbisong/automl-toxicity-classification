Porn email 

I was wondering why you sent me all that porn via email I dont appriciate that kind of behavior and it has been reported to your ISP Which is DFWFIOSVerizon by the way I found that material insane and offensive and would appriciate it if you never send me that material again Thank you goodbye

 

I have never sent anyone such email and so I feel offended by your accusation I have checked my sent email and have found no such email Also I do not know your email address and I find it suspicious that your first edit is to my talk page Please reply here Thanks  Ð¿  

Please do not remove relevent discussions from your talk page I have proof of the emails and have forwarded them to an administrator Also I found it funny as well that the second i make my account and confirm my email I get some emails from you containing porn I live an an area where viewing that kind of material can get your internet service ended What I am curious about is why is it that you decided to do something like this in the first place Please reply back on YOUR talk page Thank you
