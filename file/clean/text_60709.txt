Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical Even now Jeffro77 and you are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him from the Existence of God Talk page The Deutsch citation is entirely correct and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial But as anyone who is literate can see his citation is incorrect Chapter 14 The Ends of the Universe with additional comments by Frank J Tipler also available here

 Chapter 14 of what book By whom

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully Thats a false claim by you You therein protest too much cf Hamlet Act III Scene II line 240

 As well I dont merely make charges I prove what I state Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves Gods existence which was all it took to rile them up While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance

 Thats the current state of this matter Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial and indeed illogical edit showing

 Regarding the illogic of the edit Jeffro77s excuse in his edit summary doesnt even make sense as it doesnt explain why he deleted mention of Prof Deutschs endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an eminent physicist in his own edit ie that statement wasnt there before of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe Further Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof Wolfhart Pannenberg who is one of the leading theologians in the world has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tiplers position that the Omega Point is consistent with the JudeoChristian God

 So by Jeffro77s own words he must consider Deutschs endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God Moreover in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian Prof Wolfhart Pannenberg who is one of the worlds leading theologians has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory

 Jeffro77s edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that its a sick joke744222208
