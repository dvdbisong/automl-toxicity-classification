Controversy 
I added controversy with the full text of the Per Curiam S C decision to balance the very short article since bios of justices must contain sections of controversies if supported by verifiable sources The mere fact that the Justice was cleared still the fact remains that he was accused by the lawyer of bribery Hence it remains a controversy which must be added to make the bio neutral and not just onesided
