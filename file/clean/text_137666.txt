I apologize if you were offended by the warning You are free to remove content from Wikipedia with a valid explanation in the edit summary Vandals will often remove content from Wikipedia maliciously and therefore it is standard practice for Wikipedians to revert unexplained removal of content You are free to redo the removal but next time please leave your explanation in the edit summary so that editors will be aware of your good faith intentions Please also leave the appropriate warning on the talk page of the user whose comment you are removing I would say that substUwsocialnetwork would be best Thank you 6915512840
