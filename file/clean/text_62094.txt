Retirees 

Just a word in defence of retirees  I retired because I couldnt find the time to research and source my contributions to the standard required  And I dont think there are many people whoe seek acknowledgement in what is after all a voluntary endeavour  Any voluntary activity isnt really binary youre not either in or out  If a casual browser can add something then maybe they should be allowed out of retirement now and again   Having said all that I cant stand people who flounce out  If you want recognition go on TV 86121292
