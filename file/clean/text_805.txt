DECT isnt really a new technology Its a newer standard but TDMTDMAFDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT DECT is itself a successor to CT2 Japans PHS is very similar and of course GSM DAMPS and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces both during transmissions and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isnt transmitting continuously

As I believe Ive said before there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of lowpower radio technology and there being a link in the See also section of this article to it That article of course should look nothing like the section I yanked There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECTs dangers especially when  new technology or otherwise  there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue
