I really wanted to keep myself out of this for the majority but now I have to comment again WT101 has been piling me up with a lot of emails regarding unblocking and admin support now I see this hideously embarassing log in front of me I should have know better not to talk about this in the first place WT101 shouldnt make other users suffer like me to do his dirty work Ive recieved a grad total of 88 emails following his unblock some of which kept me up at night The incredible stress he has given me is unimaginable brining him to the IRC was stupid of me to do in the first place I only wanted a proper talk with him rather than flooding me with relentless emails I cannot apologize but admit that I was a complete idiot at the time I would like to know when that conversation took place but I am of the firm belief that it was the middle of July With all the emails I was getting in the middle of night at work eating lunch trying to take a break makes it impossible for me to live my life being pushed to the brink of insanity Akmeemana
