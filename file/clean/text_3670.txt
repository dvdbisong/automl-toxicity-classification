Sorry I didnt reply before  Queens picture I tagged  The fair use image sadly probably needs a source too  Though the image is so old makes me feel like a ass sometimes to want to tag them  The big issue is the source for fair image means we know who holds the copyright  Else theres no proof its a promo image for example  2350 7
