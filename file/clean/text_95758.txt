Use of Previous Denomination Roman Catholic in the information box on the subject of Lincoln Cathedral 

I noticed despite a lengthy and flawlessly argued case on my part that the reference to Lincoln Cathedrals Previous Denomination had recently been removed The comment made by the editor was that they dont think this is key information Thankfully the editors of all the wiki articles on preReformation English cathedrals and churches would seem to think otherwise  examples include York Minster Canterbury and Gloucester Cathedrals I do not want to get in to an edit war with anyone but this information has been deemed to be key by the majority of wiki community of contributors and editors  I believe it should therefore be respected and retained as such Thank you
