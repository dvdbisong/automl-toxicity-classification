To get away from the personal attacks above maybe a separate section about the Introduction is required The only issue I have is with the use of the word hard in the opening sentence Sculpture is a three dimensional art but the materials do not need to be hard Take Claes Oldenburg as a very prominent prime example
And the final sentence of the opening paragraph  how is text an established form of sculpture As a surface decoration
