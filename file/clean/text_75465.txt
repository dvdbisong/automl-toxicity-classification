Unfortunatly there are some people in Tasmania who will use this proxy server to vandalize Wikipedia I am sure that the government find this of extreme importance and a simple notifier of the time as long as the vandalism of an extreme nature should be reported to show who has been vandalizing this valuable page Im not sure the schools could handle a ban though
