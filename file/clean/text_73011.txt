The Polish and Czech names were rarely used before 1945 since the mountain range was almost entirely inhabited by Germans
Source or is this another OR  And please no interwar era German history books that claim Poles never lived in Germanised territories Its really also nonscholary to talk about Germans since it was rather XIX century creation
And the name of course should be established one Fortunetely Czech locations do not fall into enforced Gda≈Ñsk votewhich ignored several issues and votes against so there will be no problem with using Czech names as this is largely the area of Czech history
