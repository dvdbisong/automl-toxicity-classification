Youre quite right There can be enclisis without any contraction What I was thinking was that in Portuguese there are interesting contractions between verb forms and enclicitc pronouns in some cases Eg amar  la  amála This happens in Spanish too though less extensively dar  le  lo  dárselo Im not sure if this is worth mentioning
