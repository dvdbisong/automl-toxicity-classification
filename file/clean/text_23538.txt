Take a chill pill 
 May I inquire as to the reason for deleting the Take a chill pill page which was a soft redirect to Wictionary legal under WikiPolicy as I understand The only comment in the deletion that I can actually read as a nonadmin is stating what the content was and I couldnt find anything in CSD to justify a speedy deletion Im probably missing some arcane policy phrase somewhere but thought perhaps the best and quickest way to figure it out would be to simply ask Thanks for your time        0931 UTC  19 Mar 08
