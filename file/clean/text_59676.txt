Yes delete red links for nonnotable students 

Today eight red links were removed from the list of doctoral students in the infobox by one editor and then restored by another WPRedlink says in the 3rd paragraph that Articles should not have red links to topics that are not likely to have an article so I think the question we should consider is whether all these students are notable enough to have their own articles in the foreseeable future The fact that someone studied under Heisenberg is not sufficient for notability unless heshe discovered something important either during their doctorate or later My preference would be to remove 7 of these 8 red links until some editor explains perhaps on the talk page why each student is notable The only one I would retain is Şerban Ţiţeica because the infobox shows that we do have articles on him in 3 other languages which can be translated
