Genres 

 I can see this is becoming an issue on a number of other pages  Its not enough simply to have a source when adding genres to an infobox
 The genre field should be limited to genres that describe the album or group or whatever in general and not every genre that has been incorprated into it  Imagine what the Beatles infobox would look like otherwise
 The sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres youre adding for instance Earles says Side B is  protoSabbath sludge metal or protonoise rock depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since  etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power and thrashmetal movements   it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that My War is a sludge metal album
 Genre is the kind of thing Wikipedians often come close to slitting each others jugulars over see WPGENREWARRIOR  If you want to stay on good terms with your fellow editors youd best discuss changes to the genre field on the talk page
