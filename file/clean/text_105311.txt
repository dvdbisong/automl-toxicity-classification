Problem user page 

Hello a hitherto unknown user named UserNiceGuy removed your complaint
against UserSzopen from WikipediaProblem users  Given that this
account has only been used to make changes to Problem users and given that the
user crudely tried to cover hisher tracks by making a formatting edit and
marking it Minor afterwards it seemed suspicious and I reverted the deletion
Since this complaint doesnt seem to be prospering perhaps the best thing would
be for you to remove the listing yourself  I will ask the same of Szopen   1709 4 Nov 2003 UTC
