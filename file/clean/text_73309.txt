Well Alan the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of onehitters to the latter issue remains important
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe tobacco is allowed to run on for over 23000 bytes all drawn from only 3 notes 3 references 5 external links with 11 pictures compared to Onehitter smoking with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures  Factbase I should google this first but I think I saw an article stating that only 1 of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe compared with 5 cigar and 94 cigarettes if 110 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10 of cannabis users used a onehitter on that basis alone besides there being ethnic onehitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length
I think the value of the article depends partly on some information particularly history which is conveniently presented in picture captions so how about I look into using the gallery approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable
