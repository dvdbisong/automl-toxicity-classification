The map is not needed interpretation of maps is OR But I found a Russian source on Abdallar  Its Russian toponimical dictionary It says that until 1923 Lachin was a village by the name of Abdallar after the Turkic tribe of abdaly that lived there In 1923 it was made a town and in 1926 renamed to Lachin So if no one objects this source can be used in the article as a reference
