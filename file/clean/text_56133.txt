Ok thats valid Ive always looked at the see also section as an area where you put stuff that people who hit the page might also be interested in seeing I think I may have a fundamentally different understanding of that section than you guys do or than the community at large might I personally found List of cetaceans to be handy in the past Its seems like to me that people doing research would be able to do it more easily if they have access to more information in the form of more obvious suggested links that will help people hop from page to page
  
I dont think that people are going to be approaching these animals en mass usually They will look at one animal and if there is a link there like List of cetaceans or Cetacean Conservation Center they will have a very easy RECOMMENDED in to do more research and learn about what amazing creatures these are Clicking these links in a see also section really helped me personally to have access to information which lead me to love these particular marine mammals and I want other people to have more opportunities to get more information

I think List of cetaceans should be included because cetaceans links to a different page I would like to see Cetacean Conservation Center go in but I understand if my fellow wikipedians find that to be redundant I can see why Dolphin Research Center is redundant after a while I think these two links would be helpful for a person looking at only one animal but I can see why they might be redundant if people are looking at many dolphins Should these be included What about Marine Biology could that be included

There are things link linking The Cove film to dolphins that exist in the costal waters of Japan that I really think should be included because is discusses an issue critical to the preservation of the species There is a big difference between Critically Endangered and Extinct which needs to be appreciated when presenting facts discussed in any context about a species or ecosystem
