What exactly is your point   Is it not correct to label a former terrorist such when it is obviously correct according to the available sources Is it not good enough that the High Court in Gibraltar amongst others have stated so Just exactly when is a terrorist a terrorist according to your warped logic or are you being politically correct for the sake of pandering to the minority as I have observed others state   
As a relatively new user I fail to see your logic  WPTerrorist clearly states that the term terrorist can be used where there is unequivocal support for such which by the way is the case here McGuinness was a terrorist and further more a terrorist leader and the commander of the PIRA in Londonderry for many years this is verifiable fact It is therefore quite correct for this information to be attributed to McGuinnessif editors dont like the term then that is a matter for them Martin McGuinness was a terrorist
