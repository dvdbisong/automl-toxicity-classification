There seems to be some general confusion about the pronunciation of the Roosevelts name even within the FDR article  Ive tried to find a few reliable sources for this info

MW gives
Main Entry
    Roosevelt
Pronunciation
    ˈrōzəvəlt Roosevelts usual pron ˌvelt also ˈrü
Dictionarycom gives
Roosevelt  ˈroʊzəˌvɛlt vəlt ˈroʊzvɛlt vəlt spelling pron ˈruzəˌvɛlt
Inogolo gives this about Teddys name
Name Roosevelt  Phonetic Pronunciation ROAZuhvelt
Notes There has been much debate about the correct pronunciation of Roosevelts last name however in several letters Theodore Roosevelt himself specifies the correct pronunciation In a letter to the Rev William W Moir dated October 10 1898 he writes
As for my name it is pronounced as if it was spelled Rosavelt That is in three syllables The first syllable as if it was Rose
Note that none of these sources make a distinction between Teddy and FDR despite the claims of some that they preferred different pronunciations  At the very least each article should be internally consistent  For Teddy it seems to be clear that its ˈɹoʊzəvɛlt  His statement above makes that pretty clear  FDRs case doesnt seem to be as unequivocal but the same pronunciation seems to be the preferred one in most media  The most common variant seems to be the barely noticeably different ˈɹoʊzəvəlt  Most seem to cite the preferred pronunciation of the name being three syllables not two
