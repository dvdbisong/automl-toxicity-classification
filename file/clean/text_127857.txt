The CIA and the US government historically have admitted that Mexicans are white when they do the census I 
 I am curious the CIA fact book states that the USA is 817 white 129 black 42 Asian and 2 others This adds up to about 100 what happened to all the Mexicans and Hispanics Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white that makes no sense At what percentage does a mestizo become white 50 75 or 90 According to the US census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the US Census he or she will be classified as white This leads to my final question shouldnt then most Mexicans be classified white according to the CIA Finally I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians French and middle eastern which are classified as white everywhere A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture doesnt that make them Mestizos Any ways we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken I agree with having a predominate 3545 if you look at the Argentina demographics it states that 57 of the population has Amerindian ancestry but 8597 of the population states that they are white I am from Jalisco I would have to say that most people I have seen look whiter than Italians or Middle Easterns in the US
