Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom 

I anyone tries to add this back heres the story Back in 2005 or so my roomate Jonathan Blanchard or as we call him Jo had pretty long hair and his then girlfriend called him Jorlando Bloom as a general funnyderogatory insult It pissed him off and we started to call him that for a while Apparently one of us got on Wikipedia and vandalised the page  About two days ago he found out and thought I recently vandalized the page but we checked the history and it turned out to date from March 2005 Thats nearly 4 years ago Then  added a reference for this  probably in good faith but for the various biographical details date of birth etc 

So now you have a ton of mirrors and sources that based themselves on this Wikipedia article saying that Orlando Blooms full name is Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom Hell even the disambiguation page was affected  again probably in good faith and then reverted a few days ago by my roomate 

So dont let anyone add this back ταλκκοντριβς  WP Physics
