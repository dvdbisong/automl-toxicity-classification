the BBC retraction was not a small ordinary retraction it involved many many BBC stories stretching acrosst several of their programs Wikipedia cannot be a credible encyclopedia if it leaves things like this out I dont care if it is just a single sentence or two sentences but it has to be in the article otherwise i is a sham of an encyclopedia i didnt repeatedly add stuff in there i actually removed a bunch of my writing and then modified the writing of someone else who had added similar stuff to what i had added previously please check the history   
I disagree and as Ive already explained to you several times both on the article talk page and on your user page the BBC has retracted many many claims and stories and this one is no different nor is it notable in any way
