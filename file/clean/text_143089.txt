Avi I know you are well intentioned but I am not following the logic   Should it not count as a human rights issue because it is only 70 people  How many people is it acceptable to lock away for profit in mental hospitals But more to the point according to the sources I have found it is considered relevant to Human Rights in Israel   The number of people mistreated in other countries doesnt really nullify mistreatment in Israel  Nor do our own viewpoints on this as we are documenting these points through verifiable sources
