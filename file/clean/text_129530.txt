Yup 

You tagged this under CSDA7 that states article about a real person etc that does not indicate why its subject is important or significant Cleary the article indicates that he is important with 33 films directed and one entered into the Cannes Film Festival I think another editor has removed the tag Thanks

Clearly You have a foul attitude Alter it before you ever contact me again
