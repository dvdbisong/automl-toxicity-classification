baiting Paul 

I dont think its entirely fair the way you are searching about for paul to call you a name in order to use it against him He is clearly uncertain of what label to give you and any lable he did use is apt to be offensive jew commie wanker etc  IMO paul is a salvagable nutter who is a resource to the wikipedia on the pages where he makes his home Yes he is unpleasent but wikipunishments for wikicrimes only work on sane wikis who dont have aol Paul appears to have aol and besides crazy wikis can use httpanonymizationnet or whatever to inflict us with their wackiness Paul has shown me that he is able to compromise and is at least vaguely interested in producing a quality article This combined with his extensive hate group wisdom tells me that he should be worked with or around but never provoked The last thing we need is to turn him into a bona fide troll which he is not btw Thanks for your time Cheers  Spade 0252 16 Apr 2004 UTC
