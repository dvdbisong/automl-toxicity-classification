I would say that the communists being sent off to death camps by the nazis is enough to say that facism is not socialist  To respond to those that say that Hitler and the lot stopped trade for the gays jews gypsies communists and the hole lot neglect Hitlers views on these people  He did not take their stores and wealth away from them because he thought they were doing bad with it  He did so because he thought they were less than him or damaging his power  An anticapitalist fights for trade regulations because they believe the capitalists to be doing things immoral  A fascist does so because they dont like the people  For those of you who think my argument is weak I say it atleast beats Billy Egos argument above
