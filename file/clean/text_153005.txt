Marble Hill
Mifren

Somehow you and I seem to have developed an unproductive relationship I do think that your edits are good faith even though I disagree that the most recent ones should be included yet I cant often assume good faith with your talk page edits To accuse an editor of having ulterior motives dismissing arguments as simplistic opinion or accusing them of outright ignorance is generally regarded as disruptive and to accuse Peripitus one of the most levelheaded editors I have come across of the same things is completely unreasonable You clearly have considerable passion for Marble Hill but please remember what the purpose of Wikipedia is There are plenty of ways you can contribute positively to the article without resorting to unreliable sources for which you have a clear conflict of interest

I would appreciate it if you would selfrevert your most recent edit to the article
