Firstly I note that you posted a header disputing the neutrality of passages You gave one example and have been shown to be incorrect You were asked to provide examples of authoritative RCC teaching documents to prove your assertion that Adam and Eve were not individual people according to its teaching  you have failed to do so In the absence of reliable citations from you to support the warning headers it would appear you are expressing a POV and therefore the headers are not justified Finally could you please show me where I called you stupid with respect you seem to be making some very rash claims
