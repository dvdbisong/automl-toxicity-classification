Oregon Ducks football 

Hi Abdoozy sorry for not responding sooner Ive been in somewhat of a hiatus and didnt see your message until today when I went to update the Oregon Ducks track and field page with the recent womens indoor title I blazed through the article really quick and it looks much better Some of the eyesores have been eliminated and its in general much cleaner that it was before Ill take a look at it in more detail when I have the time Let me know if youre still interested in pushing it toward GA Nice work thus far
