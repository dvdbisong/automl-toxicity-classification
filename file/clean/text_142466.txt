I have looked over the history of the page and at some times vandalism accounts for over 70 of contributions So it isnt a case of might get vandalised but is getting vandalised all the time At this stage I dread to think how many names on there legally could sue the posters over their inclusion A quick glance spotted a couple Robbie Williams for example has just won a defamation case yet we still had him in as debated when legally it has been ruled that there is nothing debatable about his orientation Frankly given the legal complexities with listing people here Id go further and advocate that either the page be deleted as too much of a defamation risk or be kept semiprotected to stop the constant adding in of vandalistic edits by anonymous editors who edit no pages but this one It might be an idea to protect the page completely for a day while a couple of users sifted through all the names on it to make sure that there are no defamationary claims sitting there that werent spotted by those honorable editors like Bearcat who spent their time constantly stopping vandalism here But as vandalism is a constant reality not merely a theoretical possibility I think semiprotection is allowable here caint
