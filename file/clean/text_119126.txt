Readding information about your friend userVituzzu

As wrote userEnok when accused to be a sock of this Brunodam last May I want to repeat the same If this user is not of my own city it will be quite easy for administrators to confirm my uniqueness To judge only based on behavior is not right please If somebody wants my data Ill be more than happy to submit it  
I am astonished to see that I am accused of being a sockpuppet and blocked I am even outraged because I feel humiliated with this accusation An accusation of being user Brunodam without proof even if I offered to submit my personal data I demand justice I am going to complain to the Better Business Bureau of Florida and to the Police department of Fort Lauderdale following instructions from my attorney about this clear case of harassment  offense I will ask for damages Junior5  This is what I wrote last July 2013 on my defense  quickly erased by the italian wikipedia mafia leader Vituzzu on this archive about the accusation of being a vandal I AM NOT THAT PERSON and  I will show evidences and proofs of this to a judge MR my nicknameJuror5
