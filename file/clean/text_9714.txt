Belated answer about church population I daresay a large proportion of the US members who were blessed received international matchings For example American man and Japanese woman Also foreign couples as in two Asians might also have participated in that mass wedding So the number of couples isnt precisely indicative of US church membership at the time 

I can always ask Tyler Hendricks who served as vice president for personnel before he was selected US church president Hed have the old database All I know is that in 2003 we had around 5600 to 5800 adult first generation members on file at church HQ I know because Hendricks gave me the list then   0242 16 June 2009
