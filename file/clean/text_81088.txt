 I see some people are trying to politicize the protests as in which partyies stays behind it which is wrong There are people from various political and nonpolitical fractions who take part in the protests It is not right against left but new against old Yes some people probably protest again against high prices in their everyday lives but the greater part just wants a new political model and new faces not connected to the old ones who rule Bulgarian on a rotational principle for the last 2 decades  0810 14 July
