Keep at it You are doing good

Seriously and sincerely the sections you marked were weak I chopped one completely and I believe I beefed the others up You probably do not agree I improved them but I thank you

However I request that you mark the problems instead of chopping them out Of course I have no objection whatever to adjustments and I encourage you to scour the skeptical literature and add any important stuff that I overlooked
