By all means continue to suggest just try not to say anything about Flyer22 Collaborating with someone who you disagree with can be difficult especially when it comes to such wikipedia staples as templates and tags but in these low prioritylow traffic articles you have to deal with a small number of editors so you have to work with people you strongly disagree with Its not always easy trust me I know but keeping all comments focused on the article and off the contributors makes things much easier Finally if you get stuck rather than start bitching about Editor X you can file an article RfC or post your problem at WikipediaWikiProject Soap Operas niMate
