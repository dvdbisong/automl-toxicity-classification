Im fairly sure that almost all of the notable alumni are not ORthere were or possibly still are multiple editors who would occasionally come and add alumni and they got them from various online database sites that wikiprojects schools has found to be fairly accurate or I suspect that one of the editors was getting their information from the school itself
The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements but also have individuals personal information on them and Im strongly against linking to those as sources especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages but lets alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves
I had planned to go up the school at somepoint soon and use the library copies of old yearbooks and check and cite thoseI also think that the school does have alumni information Im just wrong about where it is kept
But from what I could find on Megan Follows didnt give me any reason to remove it that I didnt have for every other alumni who isnt cited
I also think that removing all alumni who are redlinked is a bad idea  A redlink is a tipoff that it should be looked into but redlinks are one of the ways that people know that something hasnt been written about and they do it
If someone wants to start working on sourcing things please go right ahead  It will probably take me some time to get tothis article is a harder article to source and very time consuming    Talk
