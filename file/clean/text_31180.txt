Your usual obfuscation There is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated naturalfree convection when forced convection the common type that happens in car radiators works just as well as illustration Choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy not heat can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there That means heat pumps dont really pump heat but rather energy Heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there cannot even be defined If you cant put a number on it you cant claim its real 

Temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this when energy of phase transitions is involved For example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to transfer energy by condensing somewhere else and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given transfer They are markets for direction of transfer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved Thats a clue that they arent fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically Physically it is potential energy being moved not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there It actually has nothing to do with heat in a thermodynamic sense 1846 14
