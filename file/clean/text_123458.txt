INCONSISTENCIES 

On the two narratives of the Creation Story Gen 1124a and 24b25 please notice the following inconsistencies
a In the first narrative man was created on the sixth day where man the last of Gods creation On the second narrative notice that man was first to be created
b In the first narrative all other creatures birds fishes animals plants etc created before the creation of man where man created at the same time both Adam and Eve while in the second narrative note that Adam was first to be created then followed by the garden in Eden and then by the animal creatures When none proved to be the suitable partner for man it was only then that Eve was created where Eve the last to be created
c In the second narrative the LORD GOD used the possessive pronoun I I will make a suitable partner for man while in the first narrative when GOD created man GOD said Let US create man
d Note that in the first narrative God created all things using His word Let there be while in the second narrative Lord God created all creatures including man out of the clay of the ground
e In the first narrative everyday of creation was always concluded with the phrase God saw his creation that it was good while on the second narrative the Lord God said IT IS NOT GOOD for man to be alone considering it is He himself who created the man that is alone Believe it or not it is was a mistake It then brings us to inquiring whether or not the creation of EVE in the original plan when the narrative suggests that had God did not mistakenly created man to be lonely Eve could not have been created Note further that the first choice of the Lord God to be the partner of man was animals Upon notice of mans loneliness God created different animals 219and the purpose of their creation is to present them to Adam for man to choose which of those animals he may like be his suitable partner Eve was actually the second choice after Adam rejected animals Hence the question again does God know what he was doing It seems the creation process a matter of TRIAL AND ERROR And true enough EVE is a product of ERROR
e Bible scholars are one in the agreement that the second narrative was written way ahead of the first narrative Gen 2 the second story of creation is therefore the original creation story But why was it written A POSTERIORI the first narrative Please consider the same parallel confusion of sequence in the first two books of the New Testament Mark is an older Gospel than Matthew but chronology seem to follow the same confusion between the two stories of creation in the book of Genesis 

 IRREGULARITIES 
a On the first day of creation God created LIGHT On the fourth day God separated the light that guides the day from the light that guides the night and all other stars and heavenly bodies Question is when did God created the SUN Was it on the first or the fourth day If its the latter what light did He create on the first day
b It is not correct to call the garden Eden The correct text states 28 LORD GOD planted a garden in Eden Eden is the place where the garden was planted and not the garden itself The narrative even mentioned the location of the garden being East of Eden
c Note that in the 25 it was stated the Lord God had not sent RAIN upon the earth Question when was rain created
d Please check the absurd narrative of Chapter 6 about the Nephilim SONS OF GOD marrying daughters of man and producing sons who were the heroes of the past and the popular men Huhhh
e It seems disenchanting to consider God a SUPREME ALL POWERFUL BEING but possesses the human frailty of REGRET 66 And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth and it grieved him to his heart
f NOTE GEN 1 the creator was GOD In GEN 2 and 3 it was the LORD GOD In 4 to 50 its the LORD
