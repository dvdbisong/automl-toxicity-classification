Is it good or bad being called a Soup Nazi Recently I invited a coworker to my house for lunch and we had Lentil Soup although a bit saltyit was not too bad but I apologized for the saltiness Besides the soup being salty I had other disaters with the lunch

On our way back to workI heard him say to himself but outloud  Soup Nazi  I was not only surprised but somewhat offended especially since he is a Russian Jew Is it a good or bad thing to be called a Soup Nazi Nanzucar
