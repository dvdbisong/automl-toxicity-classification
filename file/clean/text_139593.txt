I asked about this at wikisourceWikisourceScriptoriumPossible topical WikiProjects and got the we do things differently here responses visible there which seem to indicate that the lesssuccessful single work WikiProject model that has been used to date seems maybe less than likely to change anytime soon I could however get together a list of the extant indexes which do exist there which could maybe be added to the wikisourcePortalMilitary history and its extant offshoots and could try to get together lists of pages in Encyclopedia Britannica and other general reference sources that already exist there which maybe could be put on a page there or here
