Tone and style of article

Just a passerby and not a wikipedia editor per se However I felt compelled to leavea comment regarding the tone and style of the article it suffer from sounding very personal and has a tone of what one would expect a nonscholar explaining something in emphatic language the overabundance of quotation marks is one symptom but there are other such as the for the benefit of Europeans which takes away from the neutral tone an encyclopedic article Im not an expert on the subject in fact I know very little about it which is why I came here but even to me it would be better if the page instead sourced a number of published treatisesworks on the subject instead of going into a quasiemotional and ambiguous personal essaystyle on the subject It sounds to me like the article attempts to unite the various concepts and make it as culturally vague and generalized and acceptable as in lacking cultural ritual and mythical specifics that would make different versions more characterized as possible  and this makes the article sounds a little  dare I say  New Agey for lack of a better term I think more people would appreciate more specific mythic instances and rituals that specifically dealt with the Great SpiritMystery and also those that established important differences between various views on the subject as one would expect from proper research  if those are available  as opposed to the currently rather wateredout explanation 

As this is a very interesting subject Im looking forward to seeing how the article develops  Best of luck
