Cant help myself  
You may want to look into adding about the Poestenkill Gorge where the High Falls are and the legend of the Native American who kidnapped a white girl and married her and hid out in a cave there along with some history of the various mills You may want to talk about the gorge in the geography section There are so many beautiful dams that today create lakes and waterfalls of their own you may want pictures of them too Lake Ida behind the Stewarts at 2 and 66 with several very old dams along the Poesten kill within walking distance of there
It would be tresspassing technically but theres a great waterfall on par with the ones you have pictures of I think its called Freds Hole or something like that out past Tamarac schools on Route 2 driving east theres an old abandoned bridge on the left past where the falls are if you park there and walk over the bridge and follow the paths back the way you came youll reach after about a 2 or 3 minute walk the top of the falls I dont know if kids still go there and jump off the waterfall but I went there once when I was 17 all for a girl of course If you cant get there that way there should be an official looking townowned building before you get to the bridge it sits I believe roughly right before where the falls and there should be a path from it to the bottom of the falls
