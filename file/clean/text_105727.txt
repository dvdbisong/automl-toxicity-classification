George Burton Drake 

I noticed this evening that you took it upon yourself in December of 2008 to split my biography of George Burton Drake into two separate articles because you and your cohorts decided it was a description of two different people You were wrong  George Burton Drake the artist completely walked away from his God given talent to become a fulltime minister  I would appreciate it if you put my article back exactly the way it was originally and correctly written  As it is you have completely erased any historical background on the artist
