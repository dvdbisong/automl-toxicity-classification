Caspian blue  Appletrees 

I encountered problems with  along the lines of the usual JapaneseKorean psychoses I want to state clearly that I am not Asian myself and was merely attempting a clean up of contentious topics that divide the two nations I would say that I encourage fairly fierce gaming to deincentivize me from editing from the individual and others with similarly good grounds for prejudice and similarly poor discussion skills  or at least unwilling to discuss rather than edit war

Casually browsing the Wiki I discovered that Caspian blue was previously  and that similar JK issues has arisen under their previous account Looking at the account the history has been removed making this harder to gauge
 
I noticed that you had been dragged into before I am wondering about the ethics of erasing histories in this manner why did it happened and was it right Are they accessible somewhere else I do not know about The two accounts appear to have been used simultaneously but I am new to this so I am not sure
