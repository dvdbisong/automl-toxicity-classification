I understand that but what not is Most Germanic peoples are identifiable by their names but the language English is destroying that Do you get that Nothing will be restricted I know people like you who try to bring me down and blacking the way Im ready for that ancestry discussion with all the fools who try to steal or black out my history If necessary I will use DNA Its possible that this article will end up like that one for the Slavic peoples Why should we Germanic peoples not have the same rights If it happens I will revert your untruth anyway Have a nice day
