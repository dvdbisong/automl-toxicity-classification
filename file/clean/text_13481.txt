I think we need to change something in the following line in the Weapons section in regards to longbows with a draw weight typically around 620670 newtons 140150 lbf and possibly as high as 800 N 180 lbf I dont think theres any conclusive proof that the typical draw weight was 140150 lbs however it is possible So I would like to add a citation needed tag after that or change it to a broader range As far as I can tell its a contentious issue even amongst archeologists and there were almost certainly longbows of draw weights of 90  100 lbs See English_longbow for more info
