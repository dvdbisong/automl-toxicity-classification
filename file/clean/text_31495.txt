I dont see any major differences between Israel and Sri Lanka to allow Sri Lankas inclusion while excluding Israel A couple of users have stated that Boyle is not credible so lets move on from him The rest of the sources cited in the article are reporting claims made by fringe groups  the Tamil nationalists in the diaspora They are not Mainstream observers of world affairs and are very much of the fringe the UN and other have simply called the events in Sri Lanka war crimes and not genocide Thus there is no basis for inclusion on this page
