Recently you stated

WPBLP doesnt apply bc it is not a biographyyouve been through this all before and should have learned by now

When in fact it is you that evidently has not learned by now that WPBLP does not only apply to articles which are designated biographies

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page 
httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaBiographies_of_living_persons

You are by no means the only Wikipedia editor who seems to evade comprehension of that fact even when reminded of it and over and over again 

Have you ever actually seen what is on this page 
httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaBiographies_of_living_persons

or do you assume you know its contents without reading it
