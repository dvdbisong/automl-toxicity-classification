Move to Real Madrid CF
Hi as all articles of football clubs has their default names without the periods full stops in the initials of the words less representative of the full name I think the article should move to Real Madrid CF so Real Madrid CFs article name is the sole exception of all clubs in terms of nomenclature Ive seen so far I think the change should be done very carefully because Im sure that must be a lot of articles that refer to Real Madrid CF current name Its for this reason that I propose to make a bot for that when someone agrees to change the name the bot will change the link in all articles which refer to this article     0002 11 December 2010 CET
