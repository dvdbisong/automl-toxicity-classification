Yes the territorial evolution animation is very cool  Perhaps with the other suggested removals we could enlarge this animation somewhat since wed have more room in the History section with only two other images there  My suggestion of Toronto was just one idea of an image to put in the Demographics section  Im sure there are plenty of other possibilities
 
Very much agree with the removal of images I wanted to bring it up myself but was too lazy to do so  I agree with Jkelly and thirtysevens suggestions
