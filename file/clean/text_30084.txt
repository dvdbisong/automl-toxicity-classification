Lots of discussion but not the direction they are going  Might be a problem physically to fit the overheard wires without excavating the platforms deeper  Big debate now is how to connect the LRT to the existing Sheppard subway  Talk is it may be difficult to build a good transfer point at Don Mills Station with the centre platform and then bringing the LRT tracks out and then over the 404  so may be best to tunnel the LRT under the 404  or extend the subway one more stop east of the 404
