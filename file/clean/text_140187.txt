Plato not part of the Socratic entourage or inner circle
At the beginning of the Plato and Socrates section of the article someone had said Plato made himself seem as though he were part of the Socratic entourage but never says so explicitly    In the Apology Plato distances himself from the inner circle  I believe this involves a misunderstanding of how Plato represents himself in the Apology  I would not be prepared to say that Plato considered himself part of Socrates entourage or Socrates inner circle but thats only because its not clear what whoever wrote this part of the article means by entourage or inner circle  Is it made clear elsewhere in Platos dialogues who did belong to the inner circle  So far as I know Plato never mentions an inner circle  But he certainly portrays himself in the Apology as one of Socrates young devoted followers in quite explicit terms in fact  Given this fact I think its simply misleading to suggest that Plato somehow went out of his way to distance himself from Socrates or Socrates devoted followers  So Ive edited this part of the article accordingly including textual citations  Comment if you wish
