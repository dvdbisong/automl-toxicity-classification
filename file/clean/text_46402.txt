Thank you very much for trying Oda Mari I really appreciate it What would really help I think is if I could find Japanese adult industry awards Once in a while I find that some performer has won some adult award for example Yua Aida won the Japanese adult grand prix actress award for the year of 2005 and Sora Aoi won an award at this ceremony in 2003 but then I cant find anything about the history of the award who won in other years Who won other awards at the ceremony etc Also it appears to be a recent award so it wouldnt help with the articles on older performers I do find occasional mentions of awards given during the Nikkatsu roman porno days in the 70s which would be useful for articles on actresses and directors of that era but again nothing beyond just one mention Very frustrating Anyway thank you for trying to help and let me know if you come across any information Regards
