Nancy Reagan

I didnt want to revert your edit without asking why you thought that we shouldnt refer to Ron Reagan as the late This means the guy has dies which is true 

I think that we need to address a couple of issues there To begin with I understand your reasoning for not referring to a deceased person as the late soandso To begin with we arent the World Book Encyclopedia we are Wikipedia with a different Manual of Style I see nothing in there that directs us not to refer to the deceased as I have The very fact that you have had long arguments about this suggests that it is a matter of contention and not one that has been resolved with any finality That being said I did inquire with the Manual of Style folk regarding this matter If they come back with the determination that the late is not appropriate i will remove the reference in the article myself until then I am going to reinsert the comment as is 
As to the comments that most already know reagan is dead is not an entirely valid argument aas WP is not a collection of links We cite our work yes but each article should be able to stand on its own without assuming information There are people who dont know John McCartney was in a band before Wings or that Jimmy Carter was a former US President We assume nothing at Wikipedia As well we are not here to improve the print encyclopedias and I am not sure where you arrived at that assumption
As well I am curious as to why your user page says that you have retired from Wikipedia when you are still editing  

I can tell from the number of edits you have performed over this issue that you dont agree with my edit I think that if you wish to address Wikipedia policy you should do so in either MOS or at the Village Pump If you wish to discuss the matter then do so in the Discussion area for the article Please do not assume an editorial policy that is not in existence 
Again why does your User Page state that you are no longer contributing to Wikipedia 

 The late the late  thanks 

Referring to the recently deceased as the late belongs no where in Wikipedia  Thanks for taking notice of this overused and imprecise phrase and deleting it throughout Wikipedia   
Hi  I saw where you removed the late from Lane Stadium in reference to Frank Loria  In most cases the late isnt appropriate however there should be some designation here as his number was retired and displayed posthumously  

 More the late 

Do you search Wikipedia for the phrase somehow or just remove it where you find it  Im curious  PS your change to Hugo Street Fighter directed me here  

 WTF 
I nominated a few articles for deletion a few days ago I closed the discussion yesterday You went ahead for no reason and reopened it It was five days old therefore the discussion ends Tell me now why you put it back on  
Thats just the way Boo works6924342251
