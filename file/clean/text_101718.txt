While we havent used the Brighton Main Line SEML and Chatham Main Line did that one today as templates at each station which is what has been done on the ECML and WCML on the smaller lines like island line Ive put them on the page i think it hides code that is complex from new users and vandals people who want to edit can work out how to edit the template although a vde might be nice The only thing is that the template will only be sued by one page and there might be some anti orphan policy
