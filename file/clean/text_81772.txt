Perhaps you shopuld consider the possibility that your confrontational response to my edits coloured my response to you  Your violent outbursts to other editors seem to have the same effect  My previous comments stand   Μελ Ετητης 
Yes and perhaps you should apologise for your inconsiderate editing of pages that Ive put a lot of work into Your edit changed what I thought was a good format Yes I know about overlinking but whether something is truely overlinked or not is reasonably subjective You didnt leave any kind of decent explanation for me until after wed both reverted each others edits a number of times
My edit had 3 links in close proximity I had left them in the infobox for consistency of style ie dates in black teams in blue There was nothing overly offensive about it The article itself had no such overlinking
Your edit had a careless typo and some information removed I saw it as careless unnecessary and rude and so I reverted you You reverted me without correcting your mistakes and so I simply reverted you again as you were being continually rude 
I may have come across as confrontational but your continual No I am correct revisions came across to me as confrontational You started this You are still being rude with your refusal to take any blame As I read through your talk pages I see a lot of this arrogant I know best behaviour Sure you contribute a lot and probably do know the correct style better than the average contributor but can you not accept that your behaviour in this case was far from ideal I can accept that mine was but as I have pointed out a number of times already you started this and I felt the need to defend my position
