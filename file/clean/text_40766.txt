The deletion thing does not say you are unimportant It says that the article did not show that you were important Theres a difference Its the article thats being deleted not you Look at WPBAND and WPBIO  its usually BAND for any musicians even if they always play solo or if they rap  if you can get through either of those as a pass then look at WPRS which is about the reliable independent sources needed to prove it Then read WPCOI if you are the subject or are closely connected to the subject Then contact one of us at the bottom of our talkpage and well advise you on the state of play Not all people or bands get articles but it seems like every schoolboy group and every rapper tries Some like Bragod are not in the chartingpopular line but can still have notability They didnt write that article and no Im not one of them even though I do have a lyre and can play it I only found that youd been to my userpage by accident  I looked at my watchlist which I do on occasion Talkpages flash up a yellow banner so we know theres a message
