Some additional facts from the poll latest update
To confound some of the disinformation on the talk pages where my analysis is censored I have examined the entire list of preferences by nonBritish Irish editors of whom so far 21 have voted who selfidentify as such on their page 
Option D  20  
Option C  17  
Option B  16  
Option E  16  
Option A  14  
Option F  12  
Actually I keep this and several other facts analyzed on an ongoing basis I held this back while the RoI pushers made fools of themselves claiming that the data showed Irish editors actually favoured F The current poll is heading to impose again the British favoured pov the one  least favoured by Irish editors out of 6 options Analysis of the British votes another cay But we must keep this hidden in case it upsets the F Troops
  
F Troops Oh lordy thats a good one
