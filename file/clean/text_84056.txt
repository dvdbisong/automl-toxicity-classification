OSE 

 Regarding this editrevert dont you think thats the whole point of the  link so that we dont have four paragraphs of repeated material I think its important absolutely but this page is already long and encompassing I would think it would make sense to slim down a little where we can and the OSE concept does have its own page that not only begins with that text verbatim but goes into it much deeper
 Im not going to get into a revert war over it thatd be silly and I dont even want to think about 1RR or 2RR Id rather get your perspective and rationale surrounding it and perhaps probably we can see the others impetus and figure out the best most logical and most effective final solution Moving it wholesale probably isnt it but having a full screenpage of duplicate info isnt either I dont right now think Id like to hear your insights on the matter
