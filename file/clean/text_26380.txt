Reasons why Greece is acting like this 

One of the main rights of humans as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name  One of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one  This time I will not respond to the insults posted by UserMakedonas UserNestore and UserVergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like Wikipedia Just to quote the last comment by UserMakedonas This is a country which was a part of Jugoslaviawhere a lot of people are Albanianswhere they speak a bulgarian dialektand they want to have a greek name 
For me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of Greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country so I will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why Greece is doing this
 History Undisputable fact is that modern Greeks have very little common with the ancient Macedonians even with the ancient Greeks  Actually all modern nations living in the Balkan Peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient Greeks ancient Macedonians Ilirs etc with the modern Greeks Slavic population etc  For example the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern Macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient Macedonians and Slavic population  Probably the Modern Greek nation has origin from the ancient Greeks and ancient Macedonians but that doesnt give him a right to claim ownership of the name Macedonia
 Another interesting fact is that the name Macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in Greece before seventies in the last century  Actually the northern part of Greece was called Northern Greece Meantime Greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of Macedonia Starting from that point the northern part of Greece was renamed to Macedonia and many shops airports streets etc got the Macedonian name  So Greece is using the name Macedonia for its northern part for 30 years but Republic of Macedonia is using its name officially from 1945 that is 60 years
 One of the biggest fears of Greece is its Macedonian minority It is known that a large population of Greece claim Macedonian ethnicity Actually during the Civil war in Greece from 19451949 a real genocide of the Macedonian population took place there  Many of the Macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes  Nowadays Greece doesnt recognize the Macedonian minority and forbids the use of Macedonian language culture education etc
 Very interesting fact is the following Luxembourg and Belgium are neighboring countries Belgium has a province which is called LUXEMBOURG So far Belgium never disputed that  In our situation Greece has a province called Macedonia but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name
 Greece claims that Macedonia has pretensions over Greek territories Even if that is true Greece is several times stronger than Macedonia economically politically military etc so it is really hard to believe that Macedonia can harm Greece especially by using the name Macedonia
