If you have any idea of what Blanks Pond is you know what I mean by sewage accumulation pond All it is is a muddy puddle about 5 feet wide and 10 feet long Maybe it was once used for ecological studies but not in 10 years Many parts of the original article drastically misrepresent what TAS is There is no olympic sized swimming pool the library is not close to rivaling that of a small liberal arts college I just come to spread the truth

Allentchang the point is that there are a rather large number of crimes at TAS versus the rest of the Taiwanese schools and it has often been the subject of Taiwanese media I dont see how you can deny that Yes a lot of students go to the UC system but that doesnt really say a lot considering how poor the American education system is compared to the Taiwanese one
