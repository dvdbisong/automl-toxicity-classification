Clausius 

There are many statements of the second law which use different terms but are all equivalent Fermi 1936 Another statement by Clausius is  Heat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body   I think this statement needs to be qualified as heat most certainly can and does pass from colder to hotter bodies To take a macro example  if you place two stars of greatly different surface temperatures in the same neighbourhood they will both be radiating energy and each will be subjected to incoming radiation from the other body The radiation emitted by each body is proportional to the 4th power of its absolute temperature and is not dependent on the temperature of the other body What we are usually interested in is the net gain or loss of energy from a body but we shouldnt lose sight of the twoway traffic of radiant energy
