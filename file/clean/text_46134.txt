I dont mind I only removed them because there was a stink when they were added and it was resolved that they would only be temporary until it had been reduced appropriately unless Im imagining that  None of the other HP books have subheadings either  I though removing them would discourage embellishment of the plot  makes it look like it should be a shorter length  But as I said I dont mind  If people want them in then they should be there  Sorry  was maybe too bold
