Vadalising the subway was not subversive does not make urban environments more interesting and certainly does not challenged advertising stereotypes or make people think All it does was waste tax payer money and violate laws against vandalism It is infact profoundly disrespectful to the working people who pay taxes to support public services It was vandalism by any definition And its not POV or non factual to say so
