Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland image is dubious

The image depicted of the Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on The Custom House completed in 1791 in Dublin While a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in Ireland the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of Ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for England a lion and Scotland a unicorn is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom The Kingdom of Ireland created by Henry VIII never had its own unique royal coat of arms ie a full armorial achievement After 1603 and the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland the royal arms of James I of England James VI of Scotland did include a harp for Ireland in the third quarter the image in question is loosely based on the current UK royal arms It was created by simply placing the shield for Ireland as the sole shield and retaining the Order of the Garter collar St Edwards Crown supporters and royal motto of the current UK coat of arms which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm crest and compartment It is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the imperial crown  which is anachronistic as there was no British Empire during the Kingdom of Ireland period While I think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 until the Act of Union 1801 Ireland  unlike Scotland  did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period When the then AngloIrish parliament met for the last time before the Union of 1801 it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in Ireland as Scotland did almost a century before in the Act of Union 1707 If anyone has evidence to the contrary I would be most interested to learn about it
