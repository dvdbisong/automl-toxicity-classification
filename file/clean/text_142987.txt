Seriously  myspace and Benzinga are valid references Statements on TV are references  Or they are not  But not a single person who posts on Wikipedia and knows how to look at an easily found SEC filing to find the truth  We actually needed a debate  
Each and every person who posted either 1945 or 1955 has truly disappointed the readers of Wikipedia because of the failure to find and cite the obvious instead relying on falsities if wrong 1945 or if correct 1955 on lousy nonprimary information
Beachdrifter you are one of the biggest jokes more concerned about showing if there has been enough debate to qualify as considerable debate than finding an authoritative source to get the facts right
