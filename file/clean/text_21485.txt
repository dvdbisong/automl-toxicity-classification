Opening Bias 

In the opening segment If thats what you call it  I mean the first content before the table of contents there is the following paragraph

The conflict killed at least 1200 people mostly Lebanese citizens383940 severely damaged Lebanese civil infrastructure and displaced approximately one million Lebanese41 and 300000500000 Israelis264243 After the ceasefire some parts of southern Lebanon remained uninhabitable due to Israeli unexploded cluster bomblets44

It is blatantly obvious how antiIsraeli this paragraph is The information might be true and there is some doubt as to whether it actually is but the way in which it is organized especially in the opening segment is ridiculously biased A reader would probably read it whilst skimming the article as it is the shortest paragraph in the opening segment and then get the following information Israel killed many Lebanese citizens Lebanese civil infrastructure which means hospitals roads etc was destroyed by Israel Israel displaced twice as much Lebanese civilians and they used cluster bombs which render some Lebanese area uninhabitable

Completely biased Completely antiIsraeli Completely ridiculous Completely unacceptable of a Wikipedia article especially a good article

I recommend either changing the wording Maybe removing mostly Lebanese citizens Lebanese and changing it to approximately 15 million people displaced as well as completely omitting the last sentence The entire paragraph could be removed entirely with some of the more important information being integrated to other paragraphs

And full disclosure I am currently leaving in Israel but I would be writing this irregardless of my current location biased articles are biased articles globally I was not influenced by my current country
