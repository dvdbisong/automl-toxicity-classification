Liberal Bias claim
A common quote in this site how do you call that reoccurring quote Leitmotiv is that reality has a liberal bias from Colbert and it tries to make a point that even though their pages are in fact snarky and sassy their pages are the reality of the subject and have no progressivist or liberal agenda or bias despite socalled conservatives saying so it is in fact biased if it doesnt fit their ideology thats called denialism Also the site points out frequently on the fact of quality over quantity of a side of the argument and that not all sides of an argument have equal weight For example in the environmental situation of acceptance the only two viable arguments are that data overwhelmingly supports climate change and the contra is that correlation doesnt equal casuation but the arguments that science is antienvironmental and that the environment is against God are poor arguments for and against respectively
I am trying to say we should include that and to eliminate the progressivist view classification of this site This comes from both experience and newspaper sources Thank you
