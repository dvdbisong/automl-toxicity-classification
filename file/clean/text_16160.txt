Senegal Fast Food 

Hi I was wondering if you could help me I see you speak a bit of Bambara and I was wondering if you knew the song Senegal Fast Food by Amadou  Mariam If you do do you know if the second chorus after the quelle heures est il en paradis bit is in Bambara and if so this would be too good to be true what the words are in either English or the original language If you cant help dont worry Thanks
