Thanks Bish but I wont see them The latest pseudoinnocent machinating at ANI is the last straw Ive deliberated ignore it for days and when I come back to make a closing statement shes straight in there with fabrications again Ive no idea how much long the project will put up with the playing dumb act especially through strategies such as multiple refactors of messages Plenty of people realise that there is a problem and that it really isnt me but until the community wakes up and does some about it Im gone Youve just lost a 75 articlespace contributor to a 70 nonarticlespace crapstirrer Mail me when the community comes to its senses please And if it doesnt then I dont want to be a part of it anyway Im here to build and improve content not create a utopia
