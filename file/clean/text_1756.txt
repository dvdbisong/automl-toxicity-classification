Thank you for this but if I understand correctly you are assuming that the force is proportional to the magnitude of the apparent wind  But the total force on the sails is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the apparent wind so the forward force depends on the angle and on the square of the magnitude  That is the relation that I used for the  135degree table above  But maybe I misundertand your formulas and your table
