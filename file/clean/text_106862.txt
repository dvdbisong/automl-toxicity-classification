how to fix this article
In some kinds of academic discourse its considered incorrect to use the term racism to describe what are essentially racist actions by an oppressed minority I understand and even in certain contexts agree with this However I dont see anything wrong with calling Black supremacy racist when were talking about the kind of Black supremacy that explicitly says that nonblack people are inferior

The problem I have with this article and the article on Black Power is that they both at times conflate the legitimate if reactionary antiracist black empowerment movements with cultish and fringe ideas and groups that have little or no currency in the greater US black community

A comparison would be if you equated all people who are prolife with skin heads I bet there are a lot of prolife skin heads and both groups have a lot of white people in them but they dont really have anything to do with each other 

In order to fix this article and the article on black power we need to realize that there are racist fringe groups and describe them and their history and motivation fairly

I have a few questions 

Is every group listed here a self described black supremacy group Or are some of these groups concerned about black power there is a difference

Do we represent the history of these groups and the racial climate they grew out of fairly
