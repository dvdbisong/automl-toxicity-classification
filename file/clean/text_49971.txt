Your username 

Sorry if youve had to answer this a thousand times but why are you using two accounts in this manner  For one redirecting your user talk page breaks some scripts that try to leave you xFD notifications and the like so it can result in messages getting left on the wrong talk page but being invisible because that page is still a link  But more than that if you are going to be exercising your administrative tools you really need to pick one account and use it for transparency  If you are trying to work around SUL ie if Al Tally is your SUL name but Majorly is your preferred identity here there is another way around it  you can use the Wikimedia secure server here and the regular server everywhere else or vice versa  They have two separate sets of credentials and thats what I do  Someone else has UserB on Commons so I use UserUserB there and I simply use the https URLs for commons and the http URLs for Wikipedia
