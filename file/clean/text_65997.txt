By the way Terrillja where is your evidence of the French or American claims You claimed that the Libyan source lacks evidence and that its an unreliable source But you have no evidence to prove coalition claims We use links as information whether one is true or not is not up to you to decide Wikipedia is supposed to be nutral and show both sides reports Everything is a report not a fact that can be proven beyond doubt All we have to go on with the French claims is a link all we have to go on with the Libyan shot down claim is a report So do tell me whats the difference  AGSman61
