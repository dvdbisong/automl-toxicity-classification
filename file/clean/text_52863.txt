I would like to second Todds recommendation  among other things we need to verify who you are and that this is not a random person impersonating the real Michael Husbands
If you can explain in more detail the issues that you have with the content on the article we can review it and work with you to clean up parts that may be wrong or inappropriate
We do not as a matter of policy automatically let people decide what is ok content on Wikipedia articles about them  Were an encyclopedia not a PR website  However we do want to have accurate articles and we have a specific policy  WPBLP  on biographical articles of living persons with the intent that we not have articles that wrongly or needlessly cause problems for living persons  We do appreciate it when people bring up concerns and talk about what issues they have
Please email infoenqwikimediaorg and hopefully we can resolve things from there
Thank you
