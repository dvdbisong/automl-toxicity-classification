I disagree with you Maudoodi was a big cause of the 1953 violent AntiAhmadiyya riots and this certainly makes him militant if not outright terrorist

I dont see any majority here that is arguing otherwise but at the same time majority alone does not make something correct we need to see the facts Can you provide reference to Maudoodis linage Just because someone comes up with a bunch of names is not a proof of anything

I appreciate your desire to discuss this issue and also the fact that you do not consider yourself biased It is however a fact that mainstream Muslims are short of heroes lately in the last 600 years and there has been a need to come up with some and further post 911 there is need to rewrite history to show them less militant then they actually were for reasons of political corrections Whether this is done consciously like users like Siddiqui or sub consciously it is wrong either way Your changes are unacceptable as they practically deny the element of militancy
