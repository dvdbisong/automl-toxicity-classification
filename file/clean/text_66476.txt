Interesting I am not sure if you know enough about the word khanum It means miss madam lady In those years there was no surname in Middle East Everyone can me Khanum It is not a name However when you translate the text it looks like a name Same with Shoghi Effendi Do you think Effendi is a name No it is given to none muslims under Turkic rule So it sticks on you Therefore although it looks like a part of the name it is actually just a common title Anyway i added some explanation of the wiktionary entry regarding the madam meaning  What do you think about Madame Bovary It looks like a name if you do not know what madame is yet it is Mrs Bovary Khanum is like that
