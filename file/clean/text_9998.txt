states 

Courts I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the foo law subcategory for each US foo state  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place  While the courts are of course part of government in some states their articles were so dominating the government category that the executive and legislative articles were losing out  I can certainly see putting a see also notice at the top of each government of foo category to point to the foo law category 

Communications Communications of course encompasses media and also telephone area codes and mail zip codes and internet etc  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming 
importance at the state level however that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level 

Thanks
