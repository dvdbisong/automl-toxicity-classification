I find it absolutely ridiculous that Jacksantr consistently deletes the referenced ranking information Is this the common attitude of the alumni of this university No wonder it is ranked so low I think Bogazici Universitys culture encourages to live isolated from the world instead of becoming integrated and competent In the article it is stated that the university has some connections to the US On the other hand anybody who has been to the US would know that competition is intense between universities and rankings are very popular for good reason in the US The only way to get a good rank is to work and publish a lot as well as provide a better teaching environment without isolating from the developed countries Bogazici University needs to learn a lot from other universities in Turkey that are ranked well such as Istanbul Technical University and Bilkent University
