Dannys Growing fear of Reality

Hello Danny here is a reply to your post on my talk page you said

A Question Central can you explain something to me You obviously dont like JWs so why do you spend so much time thinking about us Personally I try to avoid thinking about things that I dont like or that make me upset Yet I notice that JWs and related articles are the only subject you deal with on WP I doesnt sic make any sense to me at all  whats up with that As it says on the WP main page In this English version started in 2001 we are currently working on 730275 articles Wouldnt you be happier branching out to some of the other subjects on WP Just a thought DannyMuse 

Ho hum here we go   I see your inevitable desire to posit straw men has taken the better of you again yawn You stated You obviously dont like JWs   Actually Danny I have some friends who are JWs and I have no problem with them as individual per se If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders not JWs Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation 

Your second reality admittance is very revealing you said I try to avoid thinking about things that I dont like or that make me upset You sure do Danny as do most JWs and dont think it hasnt been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the channel of God and the only narrow road to salvation shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you dont like This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions they just look away when reality comes knocking This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through selfdeception Danny never underestimate the power of denial it will steal all your relationship with God and you will probably let that happen

Danny I will not argue with you as you are not ready to see reality at present I pray one day you will be able but maybe that time is not yet I will leave it with God if he wants you he will open your eyes Until then I will leave you with some advice from your own organisation on this occasion you should take that advice Regards  15 September 2005

Even some religious people have closed minds They are interested only in their religion showing no willingness to as much as listen to the views of others And even though they may not have chosen their religion but simply have inherited it from their parents still they feel that their religion must be right But not every inheritance is necessarily good   What makes a religion right is its total adherence to Gods Word Whether our religion meets this criterion or not can only be determined by openmindedly comparing it with the Bible  Why some people have even been known to doubt the truthfulness of a message simply on the basis of where the message bearer came from   An open mind is willing to do what 1 John 41 recommends It says Beloved ones do not believe every inspired expression but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God because many false prophets have gone forth into the worldAwake 22 November 1984  pp810

If you find that a doctrine or teaching is a lie you should quickly forsake it regardless of who teaches it or how long you have believed that teaching to be true Your own welfare and your duty to God demand that you abandon lies no matter who teaches them   God hates a speaker of lies Proverbs 61619 A false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall perish   If you find that you have been for some time in an organization called the church and that such organization teaches that which is contrary to Gods Word of truth then you will have to choose whether you will remain in accord with that socalled church organization and its teachings or will forsake the same and rely upon the Word of GodWatch Towers RICHES book 1936 p1789

God who is himself the God of truth and who hates lies will not look with favor on persons who cling to organizations that teach falsehood Psalm 315 Proverbs 61619 Revelation 218 And really would you want to be even associated with a religion that had not been honest with youIs This Life All There Is 1974 p46

If the message the Jehovahs Witnesses are bringing to the people is true then it is of greatest importance to mankind If it is false then it is the duty of th
