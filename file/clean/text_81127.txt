Im afraid I dont see the problem you seem to have The table looks OK even at low 900px wide resolutions Your comment that adding extra columns which have no content other than NA is ridiculous as it shows absolutely no information of any kind ignores the fact that there is content in these columns Obviously there is presently none for seasons that havent been released on Bluray but this is something that exists now in many tables for DVD entries As Bluray versions are released this information will be supplied A separate Bluray table would unnecessarily duplicate content ad somebody would no doubt complain about that An all inclusive table seems the best compromise
