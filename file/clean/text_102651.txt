Yes  It was on my todo list to model this article after something like World War II  The current format of listing things chronologically caused topics like hardflex caps mid level exceptions largesmall markets owners etc to be scattered  At the same time its good to have a timeline to see how things happened  Once we get a timeline we can start breaking out existing text into appropriate topics  In addition to pulling the timeline out from the WP article we can also use httpwwwnbacom2011news0909labortimelineindexhtml and httpwwwgrantlandcomblogthetrianglepost_id9556thenbalockouttimeline to see if we have missed anything
