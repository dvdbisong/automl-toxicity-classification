Actually youre not correct  The letter I wrote above was in response to my discovering that Aeon1006 had started engaging in other roles of trust on WP namely he is now a mediator  The evidence that follows was copypasted from an AMA letter that was deleted and not responded to  Aeon1006 never really responded to these allegations at all  If I am incorrect I would sure like to see a link  I firmly believe that mediators should be neutral and for the above numerous reasons I do not believe that Aeon1006 can be so  Furthermore I do not believe that Doc Tropics can be neutral either seeing as how he posted his opinion on an RfC BEFORE the accused party had even written a response AND because Doc Tropics was also an online friend of one of accusing parties  I understand the need for your to stick up for your friend here but there really is no basis for your accusations that this was meanspirited attack  In fact youre completely missing the big picture here  that Aeon1006 completely and unquestionably violated the trust of his client and turned against the very person he had promised to help
