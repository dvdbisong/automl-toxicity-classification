A question concerning your edit to my userpage 

Im afraid despite my reading the article you kindly appended to your explanation of your edit to my userpage I am still nonethewiser as to why you chose to remove the image Gallifrey Sound of Drumsjpg I am sure you had every reason to do so however I would still like an explanation as to why you removed said image

On another note I do feel my privacy is impinged by your edit I recognise you are an administrator however I feel unhappy that by virtue of your status you feel you have the right to edit my PERSONAL userpage I noticed your userpage is locked so you would like feel as breeched if it were the other way round As you deleted my image moments after I posted it I perceive you have my PERSONAL userpage on your watchlist sorry if this is a mistaken deduction I do not wish to seem inimical to you but even though I have been recently blocked I feel it rude and an impeachment of my freedom and privacy as a wiki user If the block is the reason for your placing my userpage on your watchlist I assure you I am reformed have no intent on reoffending and have issued a full and sincere apology to the user whom I offended

I harbour no hard feelings towords you and hope you harbour none towards me as I mean no offence

Thank you for your consideration and time
