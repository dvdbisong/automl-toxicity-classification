Ok Bobrayner I will refrain from posting to the main definition of Inertial_Propulsion if you will recognize my efforts in the field in the Discussion page
 
I TOTALLY understand that controversial subjects that have the mantle of Dogma on its shoulders has an uphill battle I only request that others look over what I have done in the field and debate the evidence rather than throw stones at the other that does NOT conform to current beliefs
 

Do you have any creative suggestions for how to add the GIT Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster definition of machine types to the main page  It is a clearly novel approach to the subject and has had positive as well as negative results in the real world
 
Force Rectifying angular accelerations to produce linear acceleration as a footloose example of tractoring on the Zero Point Field has actual physical examples to give it credence but the intolerance of science as a religion prevents rational debate and examination
 
When I whirl around on a merrygoround the forces I feel tugging me off of that ride to the outside are NOT a result of tiny bullets impinging on me
 
ALL of matter that has inertia feels its place in this universe through some kind of interaction with the universe around it
 
While the Aether was discredited because it did NOT conform to our definition of a classical gas the Zero Point Field Rueda Puthoff and Haisch describes a coupling of baryonic matter with its surroundings
 
This is the medium that the GIT series of thrusters tractor on
 
I am a fairly simple guy with beliefs engendered by my experiences and I refuse to toe the party line when reality trumps faith
