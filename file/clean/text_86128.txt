Rare Breeds Survival Trust 

Hi I saw that you reverted all of my changes to the RBST article I would like you to reconsider the revert
  the list is now incorrect
  it is less wikilinked
  many of the links are incorrect
  three types of poultry are now not listed
If you have an issue with the lack of wikilinks for ducks geese and turkeys why did you not just revert the top edit which added those lists Then the text at the top will also be relevant as there will only be poultry listed in the article
