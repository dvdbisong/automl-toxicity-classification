Greece is a country which was part of the Ottoman Empire where a lot of people are Turks where they speak some dialect and they want to have the Macedonian name This is my opinion about your country and these are also facts  You once were part of the Ottoman Empire you have big Turkish minority in the eastern part of the country every part of Greece uses some specific dialect of the greek language and you are claiming the ownership of the name Macedonia About the Macedonian language this language is recognized as official in our country and it is different from any other language in the world  That fact is recognized by many relevant international linguistic institutions I can assure you have many friends in Macedonia that simply dont understand Bulgarian at all Simply Macedonian language is not a dialect of Bulgarian no matter how much you are truing to repeat that hoping that it will become true
