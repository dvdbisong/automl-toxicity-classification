Posting Spoilers 
I hearby request that all spoilers be refrained from being posted in plain sight on the official Wikipedia page Users should be forced to click a Show button in order to see spoilers I visited this page to see the background information for each houseguest and lo and behold Dicks exit from the house was spoiled for me Really unfair to someone who only watches the shows and I believe my request is more than fair

Moved this down now regarding spoilers according to WPSPOILER they are allowed and just because they may spoil a viewers experience well there is nothing Wikipedia can do Each year this comes up but policies are policies This comes up with every English BB but is most notable with the American version due to the fewer broadcasts per week As long as the information is sourced then it can be permitted And with the American version an editor is allowed to cite the live Internet feeds and Big Brother After Dark to keep the information in the article This was discussed in BB11 with the introduction of the flashbackreplay feature on the American feeds ucard 16
