Can anybody support the contention that the Tropic of Capricorn passes through England  Anything Im missing here  Territories commonwealths JK Rowlings secret volcano hideout anything   
 Okay Im getting rid of it  England was added by an anonymous user a few days ago  They also tried adding Mauritusiis or something like that Im guessing they were referring to Mauritius but theyre just north of the Tropic  So whoever it is is either goofing around or sorely in need of an atlas  
okay  Preceding unsigned comment added by 841692011   

Lattitude
The value specified in the document 23 26 2148 doesnt make sence Lattitude is specified in Degrees Minutes and Seconds or in Degrees with a decimal after it The actual Latitude page specifies it as 23 26 21 without a superfulous comma and extra number on the end Guessing is it meant to be 2148 eg 2148 seconds however I cant seem to find any corroboration It is often referred to as 235 degrees south which is 23 30 00  There seems to be some variations on what it actually is including some easily accessable regerences to the fact that the tropics are expanding See httpwwwaguorgsci_soceischaohtml for a quick summary    xrobaugmailcom

Quick addendum  the Tropic of Cancer page specifies that its 23 26 22  Also the talk page mentions that google averages it to 27 minutes exactly
