Cluttering royalty articles 

in the article Line of succession to the Romanian throne you added middle names unsupported additional surnames and whatnot to the names in list of family members of king Michael I empathize with your desire to embellish and decorate but still in my view such details are clutter in an article where they are just small parts of one list Could you kindly refrain in the futire from cluttering articles please By the way are you not aware that the invented additional surname de Laufenborg is commonly laughed at probably as that soninlaws fantasy ideas of his promotion to nobility and king Michael has not used it as part of his granddaughters name as far as can be detected from sources of that article
