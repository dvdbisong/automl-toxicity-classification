Thanks very much Deb Ill go ahead and make a few small changes then The mergerredirect is certainly useful 

Thank you for your offer of help We do have a few things that need fixed which are beyond our technical skills One anomaly is that the operetta categories are independent of the opera ones although operetta is supposed to be a genre of opera It may be simple to bring the operetta branch back into the opera tree Id be grateful if you have any ideas Best
