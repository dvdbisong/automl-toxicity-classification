For the record I was serious about running in the RFA  I was not trolling or disrupting I was advised that I should run in the RFA to see how it was like and I did so  There should have been more questions during the RFA
if there was any questions about sincerity  The RFA was not a joke it was serious  I feel I should have been made an Admin and then would have been the better example  

I felt that there was a possibility for confirmation and this should serve as example for other users to be afraid of self nominations to the RFA even when there is clearly a poll support for running in the RFA  As I am truely afraid shocked and dismayed at the admins response
As it seems now there is a new rule if the admin feel you are faking your RFA they can block you with zero assumptions of good faith
