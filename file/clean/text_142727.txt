MacedoniansMacedonian Slavs 

I was under impression that the name of the article would change to a compromising variant Macedonians nation Macedonians nationality Macedonians people or whatever since the resources shown clearly point that Macedonian Slavs is rather inappropriate Im glad the whole poll thing is over but what is the overall conclusion 

1 the naming committee will discuss on the matter of MacedoniansMacedonian Slavs name
2 Macedonian Slavs stays until another poll is organized or
3 a status quo for an indefinite period of time

Since you seem to be the only neutral admin actively engaged in this debate it seem to me that you are the right person to ask these questions  0249 25 Jun 2005 UTC

If a poll doesnt reach a decision the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued I agree that the name Macedonian Slavs is inappropriate and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV The problem is that right now we dont have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively Ill have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal its not been endorsed yet   1143 25 Jun 2005 UTC
 I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the MacedoniansMacedonian Slavs issue because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters Wikipedia would soon degenerate The English Wikipedia and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net   which is much unfortunate because it makes the term more common than it actually is There was a brief period of some Macedonian Slavs references in BBC or CNNs news articles the first half of 2001 but they have withdrawn the term very soon The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question  the different POVs can hardly be described in it I dont want to leave the impression that Im trying to put a pressure on you but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time that is dont forget about it  Thanks again for your contributions  1704 26 Jun 2005 UTC

Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral not what is objectively correct A committee which votes on what is objectively correct will not get endorsed This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee See Wikipedianaming conflict  talk 1041 Jun 26 2005 UTC

I didnt say we should decide what is correct merely what the common usage is What Im arguing against is the use of arguments such as they dont have a right to use this name which is whats been happening so far BTW the link you provided doesnt work  could you point me to the right place   1045 26 Jun 2005 UTC

Sorry about the red link thing I was using it as a forward reference That is I made a comment referring to a policy page BEFORE writing that policy page I also oppose the use in Wikipedia articles anyway of arguments like X doesnt have the right to use the name Y We can of course say that P rejects Xs use of the name Y  talk 0140 Jun 27 2005 UTC
