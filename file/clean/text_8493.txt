I see no problem with the use of  Chinese New Year 

Because the lunar calendar was invented by the Chinese in their ancient time according to Shi Jithe most reliable history record of Chinese history before the Han Dynasty and can be traced back to the time of Huang DiThe Yellow Emperor who lived in the era around 25003000 BC That is a history of about 5000 years or more So the Chinese have no doubt own the credit Do not let politics jealous or racism blind your wisdom guys
