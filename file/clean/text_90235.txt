Hello guys I am not in a hurry per say my concern is that until very recently there has been no hint of the text being edited only talks about it being rewritten some time int he future in the mean time AFD Proarepa and the Beyloune and Barrueco family are mentioned the biggest encyclopedia on planet hearth in a huge scandal without them having had had anything to do with it Just imagine All news reports agree on where the money came from who carried it for whom he was carrying it who was charged with the crime and who the money was for None of those persons have anything to do with the companies and persons on list A Of course the following suggestion is tainted with my stance on this matter but perhaps until the article is rewritten the text in bold could be suppressed at least temporarily

According to El Nuevo Herald and El Universal Antonini Wilson owns a condo in Ocean Club Key Biscayne Florida together with Wladimir Abad he is registered as owner of a building located in Mashta Avenue in Key Biscayne valued at US396 million22 Wladimir Abad is the secretary of American Food Grain AFG23 a part of a Venezuelan holding called Proarepa owned by Sarkis Arslanian Beyloune and Ricardo Fernández Barrueco2224 Proarepa was in charge of the food distribution during Venezuelas oil strike of 2002 when Chávez signed contracts for food distribution According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office Proarepa is a private company that has joined this mission Mission Mercal to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer22 According to El Nuevo Herald Antonini Wilsons name is linked to other companies in southern Florida such as Venuz Supply Inc Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc222526 La Nación says that Antonini is among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez26 In May of 2007 the US Drug Enforcement Administration DEA confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain The report according to The Miami Herald says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States222327
The mention of Antonini owning the condo with Abad will stay since there is a link there
What are your thoughts on that
