Why are you ignoring what I just said though There was clearly a consensus to not include wild and speculative claims in the infobox during the straw poll and subsequent discussion where all editors were taking part The later discussion is meaningless because we cant reasonably expect all editors to stay on a DRN for such a long amount of days The discussion had already gotten stale Are you disputing any of this Thanks
