This isnt an argument  An argument is a well reasoned debate between two people based on something that can have differing points of view  This can not  People who want Justin to live have what the creators intentions were and they are well stated  People who go by purely what is seen on the show know he is dead for now  As the series ended with him dying and didnt show him reawakening there is no argument Just people telling the truth and others twisting it
