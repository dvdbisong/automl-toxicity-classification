Redraft of this article 

I have removed all of the NPOV language littering the page and have hopefully got it back on track

I cannot find any genuine criticism of the new stadium design from any reputable published source and as such have removed the section entirely  Please do not return it to the text without providing sources  it is simply not enough for you to believe something to be true you really do have to convince all Wikipedians that what you write is true by backing it up with evidence

I think that further revision of the NPOV and personal criticisms of the design without sourcing would be vandalism and I will ask an administrator to protect the article  A huge number of news outlets students and individuals will come to this page first when researching the new stadium  Misrepresenting personal views at the expense of fact does noone a service
