Proposal for a Wikiproject on the United States 

I have proposed creating a Wikiproject on the United States  See TalkUnited StatesProposal for a Wikiproject on the United States  I assume there will be no objection to the proposal  Planning for the future Im thinking that I would use the WPMESO and WPAZTEC projects as a template for this new project  Im interested in your thoughts about what changes you would make in these project templates  In other words I want to incorporate all our best ideas in these two projects before using them as a template for the new project
