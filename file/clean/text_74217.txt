Why did you delete the bulk of the West StPaul and East StPaul articles for likely copywright violation Are you able to prove that the articles were in violation of a copywright I didnt write the article but the original articles were actually quite good and are now just a shell of their former selves If you were certain the articles contained copywright vio why didnt you rewrite them instead of just deleting everything  Also much of what you have written on the Winnipeg articles is incorrect ie Old Kildonan once being a part of East Kildonan never was and West Kildonan lying north of Inkster Blvd that was not the boundary that Winnipegs Mennonite population is 33000 not supported by statistics Be sure that you are absolutely certain of the veracity of a fact and have done your research thoroughly before you write add to or edit an article Otherwise readers will will receive misinformation and that is not what an encyclopaedia is intended for The Winnipeg and city area articles are coming along quite nicely Please dont delete any part of them for unsupportable reasons
