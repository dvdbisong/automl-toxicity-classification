There are so many articles that wish to down play the parts of the JW religion that they really dont understand  I will not go back in and change the article  If people want to discredit something they dont understand that is ok  this being said is in no way directed to anyone in particular  I just find it interesting that people want to write up document reports on religions that they are no part of  There are pages on Cathlics Baptist and other religions that state opinions of people who are not even a part of those religions  To me and this is personal it is very sad when there are people who will critically analzye something that they do not believe in themselves  oh well
