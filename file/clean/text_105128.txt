Text removal 

Hi there I just saw your message about the Columbia article To tell you the truth I dont remember exactly why I removed the text given that it was a year ago However I think the part about tears streaming down Cains cheeks is certainly not encyclopedicits trivia thats not really relevant to the article As for locking the doors Im not sure what point you were trying to make there but it is standard procedure for a crisis in Mission Control

Hope that helps If not let me know and we can talk further
