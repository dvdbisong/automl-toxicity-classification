Time for some recognition I think  

Hi

Sorry for my absence over the last few months but as winter is approaching I as usual have been sticken by arthritis flu and travelling From the end of August my time is usually limited as I have a lot of family events and the bad weather takes its toll on my health

I realise that I could have done more work on the History of Norfolk and now that the family responsibilities are reduced I will probably start to contribute more to WikiWorld than the past three months

It istime I think that your hard work is recognised  you have greatly improved the article taken constructive crtiticism well responded to requests and maintianed a completely civil and functioning attitude to editing and so I think this may be in order _

  The Content Creativity Barnstar For your hard work diligence attention to detail attitude to cooperative editing and your superb contribution    

Hope to collaborate again as I really have enjoyed watching the article grow
