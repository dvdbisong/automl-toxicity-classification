Positive or negative it seems odd to include such a large number of reviews at all I have not seen anything comparable in other wiki entries for books and you certainly wouldnt see such a thing in a more traditional printed encyclopedia Imagine an article on A Tale of Two Cities in the Encyclopedia Britannica that included reviews Ridiculous This is meant to be an encyclopedia not a dust jacket Id suggest the removal of the reviews At most there should be links to reviews so the excerpts could be seen in context
