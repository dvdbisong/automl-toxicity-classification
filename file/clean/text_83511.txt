As we saw earlier in Greek theres nothing for that laid form besides obscure glossesrare words such as laidon renowned and that other word meaning insolent which doesnt fit these names I looked through Perseus and my Liddel  Scott book I connect laidas to laidon euonumon and its presence in Spartan far from Illyrians but the Dorians migrated from the north  Illyrian see also Laedo Laedus etc is mysterious Anybody else have more info on this Did Cabej  that other linguist not know about Sthenelaidas Its likely they didnt hes not exactly famous these days
