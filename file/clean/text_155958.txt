The pyroxenerich rocks which result from the contact metamorphism of impure limestones are described as pyroxene hornfelses calcsilicate hornfelses

The above statement sounds inaccurate since pyroxenes in hornfels are the byproduct of metabasite and metapelite metamorphism If a limestone was that siliceous with a large mafic component it would no longer be a limestone but a shale
