The fact is the page is called list of Frieza related characters not Frieza related groups 
Meaning its about the characters not just a group It should be listed the same way Coolers armour fighting squad is listed It does not defeat the purpose of the Ginyu Force page the Ginyu Force page has many other things listed other than just the bios If this is the way you think to shorten everything why dont you just take away Goku and Vegeta page why not just have Gogeta p
And I dont think I can do anything I want with these pages but sure looks like thats what you think
