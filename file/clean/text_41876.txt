Yes I understand that the technical proposal is to rename the article but I also appreciate that names matter  Its also worth noting that this is the longest rename discussion Ive ever seen at WP  Apparently Im not the only one who thinks the name of this article matters more than usual  

I may be missing some very notable exceptions as I have not been involved in the dispute until now but I see no unbiased editors  I see editors who either support the concept of mens rights or feminists  That is to say without belaboring the topic I see two diametrically opposed ways of viewing the world  One way says men of every society in every corner of the world developed abusive and patriarchal social structures that oppressed women  The other way says that gender roles evolved by men and women working together in accordance with biological imperatives like survival  That these gender roles limited benefited and oppressed both sexes in different ways by forcing them to conform to the roles that society dictated  Feminist patriarchy theory has a fundamental need to attach male malice in the way gender relations evolved and inculcate guilt in modernday males for the supposed sins of their male predecessors  Tangential rant aside if we can appreciate that there are two opposing sides here we can achieve a much better and balanced article  But instead what we have on one side are a bunch of feminist editors armed with all the sources that 30 of feminist dominated academia can churn out disingenuously feigning to be unbiased disinterested editors who are merely trying to apply WP policy to produce the best article possible  On the other side we have the mens rights activists  Mens Rights are essentially what mens rights activists say they are  If the article mens rights doesnt have at least 50 of its content from sources that point to men rights activists a term that I see used pretty pejoratively on the Mens Rights talk page then the article is hopelessly biased  All feminist sources regarding mens rights are essentially sources that respond to the arguments andor actions of mens rights activists male or female  To base more than 50 of the article on the feminist response to the articles topic is a poor way to write an article  Such an article can easily occur here if we try to stick to the best WPRS without including both sides because we have failed to acknowledge that there are in fact two sides here as we will end up with an article that amounts to Mens Rights according to Feminists  The reason for which being that the mens rights activist source may be from some small publisher or selfpublished but the womens studies text will be published from Oxford Press
