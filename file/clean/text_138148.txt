Reception 
The reception of this article doesnt seem to take everyones view into account I see only positive viewpoints and it ignores the rest of the WC3 fanbase especially on East and Europe where DotA has not completely taken over and there are vast amounts of players Most of which happen to be less trollish as becomes evident if one surveys the majority of DotA players with the Braindead test by requiring them to talk coherently Kinda like b isnt it who simply detest the game for its rude community that now believes Completely on west and to a certain extent on other servers that attacking new players for the simple fact that they are new and booting downloaders without consideration or remorse Nonmoderated games are filled with leavers And now the banlist extends to games other than DotA where normal players may be banned for abusive reasons Beating the host using novel and effective noncheating strategies etc DotA has overrun BattleNet with a storm of absolute idiots The intelligent fraction of DotA players does not nearly make up for the fact that now small promising maps are being shoved aside by DotA Look at Obsidian Depths Look at Mana Clash Look at Advent of the Zenith because it isnt to that communitys preference
Im kind of shocked that there arent more of this kind of stuff on the talk page but I bet somes gotten deleted before Ill check and it better not be gone in a few days
