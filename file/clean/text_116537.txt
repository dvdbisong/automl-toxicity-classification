I have contacted some adminisrator friends about the abuse and unprofessionalisim of Will 

I am not sure why administrator will is sending me messages I am using edits for the PIRA that are completely verifiable and my sources are quoted within the text of the article It is important for authors and administartors on Wikipedia to realize that there actually are professionals who know these subjects much better then themselves and that it is VERY possible for Administrators to be wrong with thier fascts and fact checking Administrators who immediately revert changes just becuase they are too lazy or arrogant to do a little reasearch are one of the reasons Wikipedia is not being taken as seriously as it should Administrator Will should at least TRY and be a professional and not destory the hard research and knoweledge of others because of his own sad insecurities and bias

I am in no way damaging this article I am merely trying to correct the many factual errors that other authors have littered this page with I have a few administrator friends who I will be contacting about the highly unprofessional behavior of Will and if I were him I would get my act together
