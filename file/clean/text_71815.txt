Hi again all  I wasnt too clear about what Piotr and now M0RD00R too wanted me to look at Piotr says that it is this section he was mainly concerned about  I mentioned it below but I have a bit more to say and will be clearer  I dont think the Boddenheimer stuff is acceptable  Nor is the Polish independence following World War I was accompanied by a wave of pogroms and discrimination against Jews  They just dont have enough to do with the topic of the article even considered widely  Theyre OR SYN will raise blood pressure and are fattening to everybodys girlish figure 

We come again to the crucial question of what is this article about to which I add another distinction a ghetto benches considered narrowly  this particular discriminatory measure  b Discrimination against Jews in education in Poland wider  c Antisemitism in Polish universities in Polish education widest  b or c seem to be reasonable popular choices This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus  What is OR depends on what we decide the article is about since it is clear that we are using ghetto benches a bit figuratively  Changing the title is a possibility Under c but probably not b the replacement from the notes that I suggested the quote from Meltzer In fact ever since the attainment of independence the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for antisemitic agitation would be acceptable Again I dont see how Boddenheimer or Polish independence   discrimination against Jews  fits in under any reasonable conception
