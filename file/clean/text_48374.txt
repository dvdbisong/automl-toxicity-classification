You are not butting in from my perspective I am happy to have interested readers respond I note you made a strong statement on AZs discussion page just before you came here pointing out from your personal knowledge the mistake about there having been no emails to ArbComon the subject I dont know how many of the other commentators might be influenced not to email because of the identification issue You may be in the majority or you may not My point is simply that if there is anyone who refrains from commenting for or against because of the identifiaction issue then there is a possibility of bias If the pros and cons are equally reluctant then the bias is only a technical one
