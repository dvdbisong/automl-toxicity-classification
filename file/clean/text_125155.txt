First of all presenters and judges of all shows should be listed in chronological order beginning with the first people assocated with the show to who is on it now  That only makes sense  It looks very confusing to the reader how it stands right now  Another point is the years should be listed fully  For example as it stands now 200911 some people might not understand what that 11 stands for not only does it not make sense but it makes the rest of the information look very sloppy to the eye
