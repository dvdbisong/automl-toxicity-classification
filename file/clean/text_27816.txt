Should you stay or should you go now 

Your problems here began with the improper and unsourced edits you made to the bio of Andrei Treivas Bregman alias Michael Lucas at the behest of Lucas Lucas listed on the talkpage of the bio the changes he wanted An anonymous editor suggested that you had done this in exchange for sexual favors from Lucas  it had nothing to do with any foreign trips you made With these edits you reversed your earlier edits and contradicted your earlier statements regarding the content  content you eventually changed for Lucas Later you engaged in a prolonged exchange with another editor over the inclusion of Bregman in Lucass real name Despite the fact that Bregman is reliably sourced you removed it like Lucas wanted Most recently you became embroiled in conflict over the use of your Farrell picture no need to go into detail about that

Your recent conduct and your posted word show you to be arrogant capricious emotionally needy and teetering on mental instability
