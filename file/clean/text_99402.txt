Ive had just about enough of you Since you have been following me around to different articles I decided to check your contributions and find you secretly posting about me on this talk page  Apparently the ANI youve been posting to wasnt enough  After you obsessively reverted all my sourced edits to the few pages from yesterday I decided to disengage and move on to other pages  But youve followed me to new pages and continue to revert everything I do without discussion  I understand that there is a subtle bias against IP editors so this probably wont happen but you really should be topic banned for this sort of ownership and harassing behavior 2601719805B535E68C6C3D1EA148
