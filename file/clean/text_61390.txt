Oh Im sorry I didnt see your response above until you pointed it out Thank you I saw the circle with the chili pepper in it I had already saved that picture to my computer and almost uploaded it to Commons then changed my mind because there is an image of a woman behind the baskets which makes it clear that these baskets are very small probably made as souvenirs Since the real baskets are quite a bit larger I wanted a picture of a real basket I didnt find any I liked on Flickr I found some on Google Images but I wasnt able to find any that had that license In fact I couldnt find any license information on any of them except that on some I saw If you would like to purchase this photo

I have a question is Flickr somehow connected to Wikipedia or Wikimedia Commons You said above that I could click on the three dots to upload the photo from Flickr to I assume Commons Sorry to be asking so many questions I just want to learn
