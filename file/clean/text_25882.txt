Hi FPS 

I understand what Niko discussed on the talkpage but I think that it is correct to put the image in the Historical perspective section because it represents one phase from the relations between Macedonia and Greece not to mention that it is undoubtedly connected to Macedonia naming issue I really dont want to initiate the wellknown quarreling and bickering around these types of articles but presenting the arguments from both sides is crucial NPOV  Thanks
