Your musings and reflections are totally off topic because again this is a discussion page for discussing how to improve this encyclopedia article which must be based on verifiable citations to reliable sources  Therefore your anecdotes about your emotional reaction to the film do not belong on this page  I must ask that you desist from further personal attacks and I must note that I have argued consistently and forcefully for the inclusion of the fact that Albert stated that his interview was deliberately edited to misrepresent his views I have argued consistently and forcefully that the lead should state that the film was made by PWBJZKSWTVOTTYOLWRs and I have argued consistently and forcefully that the lead should state that the film has received extensive criticism for misrepresenting science or promoting pseudoscience  Please do not misrepresent my views again and please refrain from further personal attacks
