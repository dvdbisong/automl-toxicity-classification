Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola which I just deleted

I had previously identified some concerns with this article You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them We let some time elapse so you could address them but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems

In addition you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page although archiving is generally considered preferable However if you simply remove material and do not respond it is difficult to understand your thinking I dont know for example whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted Again if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking I dont know whether you thought it was deleted in error whether you thought you cured the problem or something else

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source However we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem It does not Please read the following link for more information WikipediaClose paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing it only picks up exact matches Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic Ill provide the link below so you can see the results However I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately we have identified other articles with issues I havent had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing

I urge you to take this quite seriously If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules If you do understand the rules and ignore them you may be blocked Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesnt happenTalk
