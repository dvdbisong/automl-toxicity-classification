This DavidShankBone has been personally attacking me for a long time  I dont know how many times he has called me a vandal without even one diff   Even though Ive asked for it   Recently he vandalized my legitimate comments echoing the words of others      and has gone out of his way spending literally hours trying to get me blocked   Concerned admininstrators I know what it looks like an IP  were all evil vandals right    But I implore you to ask him for where he has seen this vandalism   I promise you he wont present any caveat i did revert to someone elses vandalism accidentally proving that ShankBone has been attacking me for a loooong time   In any case Im happy to participate in dispute resolution an RfAr suits me just fine to get this ShankBone to stop threatening to get me blocked cause most of the time he is ignored but once in a while he comes across an admin that will do his bidding rather than follow the basic wiki dispute process
