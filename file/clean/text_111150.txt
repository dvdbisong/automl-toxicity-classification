Thank you for that answer but thats not what I asked Have you or have you not read Mussolinis autobiography and speeches That wasnt my question either thats a new one If you have then you would know that claims of Fascism being anticlerical is absurd the position of individual anticlerical selfprofessed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself You would have to resort to conspiracy as the wouldbe scholars have and claim that Mussolinis ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was antiClerical and secretly considered antiClericalism intrinsic to Fascism How convenient And as for Darwinism which was my other point you wont find anything on that either Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution nor did Hitler for that matter Did he believe in evolution Considering the times he lived in probably But he never mentioned it let alone social Darwinism Yet this article presents social Darwinism as if it were intrinsic to Fascism 
To answer your question again liberal definitions include obsession with race as racism And you certainly are obsessed with it It took you two minutes before you ridiculously threw out the antiSemite and Nazi cards which told me that you embrace liberal definitions of racism
