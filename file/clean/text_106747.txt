I assume your response means you are not an admin  As I have said to the other party involved you are promoting a very unfriendly wikipedia  Accidentally changing one number in a year or one word when an inexperienced user thinks they are in sandbox is not vandalism  As a representative of wikipedia you should be nicer to users  If you feel this is vandalism you should report it to an admin not act on it yourself
