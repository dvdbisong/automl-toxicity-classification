If you dont know that Brown is about a conviction under  504 of the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 then you are the one who hasnt read Brown See I can do it too

Hey why dont you also check the date of Brown while you are at it to make sure it took place in the 60s See I can do it too

Your most recent post lacks a certain shall we say coherence

And youre still babbling about bills of attainder You still havent explained why you think Obamacare violates the constitutional ban on bills of attainder Or have you given up on that goofy theory

No I am not clueless And yes it obviously is painful for you to try to talk with me  or to put it more precisely its painful for you to try to argue with me   0021 24
