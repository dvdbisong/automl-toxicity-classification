I replied at WTNRHPformerly listed subtables As for the NRHP templates at Commons I first wanted to do some automated runs before the humans start investing time As you might have noticed CommonsCategoryNational Register of Historic Places with known IDs increased a lot in size I would add the template to both the categories and the images Currently the template isnt clickable yet like the Rijksmonument template at this example but that might change in the future
A lot of images have known IDs right now I plan to extend the monuments api to make it possible to easily fetch these images for reuse So you enter 82001192 and you get a lot of images of the Empire State Building
