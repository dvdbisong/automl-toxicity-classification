Frank Rossitano 

I know youll delete this anyway Jeffy since a comment left by someone like me would obviously be of no importance to someone as perfect as you but may I humbly inquire as to why you see fit to delete the hat section of the Frank Rossitano page preferring to engage in a barbaric edit war over of an intelligent discussion I realize there must be some mistake in my interpretation of this Jeffy especially given the flimsy rationale you provided since I know someone as perfect as you would never do anything without a good reason Could you please see fit to clear this up for me Jeffy
