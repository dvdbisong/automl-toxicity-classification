Posting here is best unless the discussion starts at the article level  After posting your response type 4 tildes  at the end of your post and that date stamps your posting  Right now an automatic bot is running that does it for you Some other hints  Use the Show Preview page when you are editing and review and make changes until youre satisfied with your edits then Save page  otherwise the page has a long history of edits for the same update

I only want to reemphasize again that WP is an encyclopedia not here for promotion  Im glad you are expanding your article and will hold off on an WPAfd until other editors chime in  To be safe make sure you present information in a neutral and unbiased fashion  do not add promotional language  Present Pros and Cons  a clear indication that you are attempting to be unbiased in your presentation  Keep external links to a minimum and use inline citations instead  Official Website is sufficient  If you get a great review from an outside independent source reference it  Dont use paid inclusions or PR material  again a red flag because they are not unbiased  The standards are written up pretty well here WPCORP  Good luck
