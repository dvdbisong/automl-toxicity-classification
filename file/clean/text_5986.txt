I saw the Speedy had been removed I tagged it as unreviewed initially due to the poor quality of the article which I thought had been marked as reviewed hastily before seeing that you had added a CSD which was removed Sorry for the above I had no idea it was sent and I only unreviewed it as it needed something doing I just reported the remover as a likely sock Thanks
