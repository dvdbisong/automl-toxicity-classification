Where is this section WLU Your changes must be verifiable Also like my last comment I have no idea where you guys are with this sentence I see you added page 262 to the citation WhatamIdoing Can you say what part of that page supports this sentence how you were able to link the two together reasonably etc Again the key components are 1 shaming comments 2 appearing unattractive in public and 3 baldness Can you let me know what page 262 says the relevant part Thanks
