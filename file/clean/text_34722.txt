Fully protected Thats weird  I thought it was supposed to be a 24hour protection Wasnt that over a week ago   

 This is a longrunning content dispute and admins are only allowed to make edits to protected pages if those edits have consensus If you disagree with the protection you should ask  about it as he is the one that protected the page If talking with him doesnt resolve things you can make a request for unprotection at WPRFPP Best    talk  

I agree the page should be renamed to suit a worldwide English speaking audience not North America only 8241107134
