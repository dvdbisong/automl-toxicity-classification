Reversion  

Why did you revert the page
What didnt you like about my edits 
In my view there was nothing wrong about my edits Those people are all alumni of the university I thought the section was too weak and short compared to entries of other universities like McGill  Wisdompower  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs

Hi I saw where you just tagged this for speedy deletion as patent nonsense and was curious as to why you chose that tag The page is wellwritten and doesnt appear to be gibberish XMan

  The AntiVandalism Barnstar Youve beat me to reverting vandals several times tonight and when I took a look I couldnt help but notice the sheer volume of vandalism patrol youve been doing I think all your hard work deserves a barnstar

 Emile Durkheim 

Why have you removed the edit to the suicide section in Emile Durkheims page which mentioned that egoistic suicide is also known as egotistical suicide  This is a productive edit as many editionstranslations refer to only one term and not the other  Readers should be aware of the relation between the terms  Preceding unsigned comment added by 19224623474   
Its redundant Egotistic and egotisticalsuicide are the same thing   
That is the point to stating that it is also known as the other term  The words are not the same egoistic refers more to a general selfcentered nature while egotistical refers more to a selfcentered way of thinking and speaking  Look up the terms and you will see that they are not perfect synonyms  The implications of both terms on the semantics and the basic message of Durkheims theory is significant  This information  a matter of 5 words  should be included in Wikipedias article  Both are valid terms with different implications  It would not be the first time a Wikipedia article lists multiple terms for the same thing
According Random House Websters Unabridged Dictionary theyre the same words He performed an egotistic suicide for egotistical reasons same thing   
Unless that was a typo you just used exactly the same word twice  The difference is between EGOISTIC one T and EGOTISTICAL two Ts  Look up the two words in MerriamWebster  Preceding Wik
