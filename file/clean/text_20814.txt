Yeah OK This is a problem You dont have local knowledge Principals are never voted against by their Parent groups Rainbow St PS is the only occurence I can recall in my history of having worked with NSW schools Same goes for Ferncourt PS Ethics program Google for Ethics Schools NSW for a head slapping fun time regarding ReligionState relationship As for precedent setting Middle Harbour pointed out above set a precedent
I selected out those issues because theyre pretty heavily covered in Australian media You could find articles covering the same issues at various other Australian news outlets shrug Therefore you would suggest that articles on these schools should survive As I said cool   talk  contribs
