Participation at the Ireland page was widest and consensus was against the move Participation on two recent polls at the Republic of Ireland page also had wide participation and fell heavily against the move both were closed Participation at the disambiguation and task force pages were limited but consensus in those polls came down weakly in favour of the move

Initially Tariqabjotu performed the move request in error  having only seen the request at the task force page When this was brought to his attention he posted a response on this talk page His decision was to maintain the move against consensus as consensus had arrived at an illogical conclusion which he linked to WikipediaPolling is not a substitute for discussion Later he would comment that he had not read the discussions because Theres so much stuff to wade through

Issues believed to be at play

 Vote stacking
 Consensus
 Polling is not a substitute for discussion

Some issues at play during the discussion
 Disambiguation Is there a primary topic

OBJECTION What kind of summary is this The propenents wanted section above is selective where are the nonforked Ireland options that opened the WPIDTF taskforce ie Ireland as either state or island but not both and not part of a dual state situation with Republic of Ireland The IP has ignored all the many main issues and all the problems that have got us here too  Why are we letting this particular IP do this I propose archiving this section as it is clearly disrupting and made to disrupt the discussion and progress being made above it He is spamming it all over Wikpedia too  
Ive moved the content discussion that was sidelined above this to the bottom of the page This page will be unlocked soon and it too important to ignore   
Can we stop with the refactoring of the page It isnt helping it just makes it fing confusing as things flit around the page There is clearly distaste for the manner of the move Matt you cant just sweep it away into an archive because you dislike the methods applied being questioned    Talk   
I simply moved the ongoing mainpage discussion below this inte
