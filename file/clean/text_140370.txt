Chopin began travelling outside of Poland  or should we say the Duchy of Warsaw  in 1828 Berlin 1829 Vienna Prague Dresden 1830 Dresden Prague Vienna 1831 Vienna Stuttgart Paris In order to travel he needed a passport and I assume forgive me Widipedia for assuming that he travelled on a Polish or Duchy of Warsaw passport  No I have no facsimile of it nor have I ever seen any but without passport Chopin could not have left Poland
