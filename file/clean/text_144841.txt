I demur that any of the above charges are true  In fact the actions of DPeterson have been harassing me and others for some time including recharacterizing your softban of me on the Barrett page as saying I have been banned on the Bowlby page  Now he has put up a article Advocates for Children in Therapy claiming that it is a fringe group and that I am a leader of that group and more all without the slightest reference to a reliable source  I challenged that and other socalled facts with a request for citation and he comes on to my talk page with a claim that I am vandalizing the page  You have set a chain of events into motion with your softban of me  I am not asking that you necessarily reverse yourself on that matter but would you please either set me right or set DPeterson right about the various issues with respect to vandalism Right now to me DPetersons actions resemble that of a schoolyard bully thinking that the playground monitors would approve of his actions  Thank you
