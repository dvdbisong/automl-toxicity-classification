Good Article review
Using the everchanging meme catch phrases of the internet this article is full of win In other words I find this article to be richly deserving to GA status due to its high quality There can of course be some improvements but nothing that I think represents real failures of the Good Article criteria The article is neutral almost everywhere I see no sign of real instability it seems to fulfill the specific MoS guidelines of the GA criteria nicely there dont seem to be any obvious gaps in the articles coverage the referencing is top quality and the images all seem to be ok I also have a few comments on more minor things that should help improve this article even further
You mention Conservative clergy as people who opposed the bank but even though that is exactly the phrase the reference uses im not so sure thats actually what the Islamic equivalent of clergy is called Might want to look into that 
The paragraph about the Global Elders seems like it doesnt belong because it looks less neutral than the rest of the article convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom independent leadership and integrity together to the world is entirely subjective and this line is not referenced I presume this was meant as a direct quote of some statement they made that should be referenced and the sentence should be framed in a way that makes it clear that it was from a statement rather than a statement of fact according to Wikipedia alone 
It looks like the paragraph has more to do with the Global Elders rather than Yunus It should focus on that Yunus is a member rather than talk about who is funding the Global Elders and who is the chair and all those details not directly relevant to Yunus 
In the family section His younger brother Muhammad Jahangir is a popular television presenter doesnt seem to be referenced
