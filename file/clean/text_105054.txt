Strong Support I dont like internet piracy it is stealing Though this act will stop piracy it will also stop freedom We can have laws that stop piracy but not freedom If this act passes other free nations will follow suit It will stop a new kind of society a society more free with more participation than any before It will stop the new renaissance The future of humanity will be a lot different if this act passes If a shutdown of wikipedia has any effect in stopping it we own it to humanity to try   1835
