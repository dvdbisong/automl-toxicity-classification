This page needs to be edited down to a handful of sentences and then merged with Nose if not altogether deleted due to the fact that it is merely a slang term with denotions of eugenics and discredited pseudosciences such as phrenology  The authors included a long paragraph by a discredited 19th century scientist named Samual George Morton of which only five words the nose large and aquiline pertain to the article itself As Wikipedias own article on Morton says and as most medicalscience students are taught Samuel George Morton is often thought of as the originator of American School ethnography a school of thought in antebellum American science that claimed the difference between humans was one of species rather than variety and is generally seen as the origin of scientific racism
The paragraphs in this article are drawn out to unnecessary lengths so as to provide the appearance of substance particularly the Buddhism one which uses 53 words to say that statues of Buddha should have long noses No reference is given
Socalled hooknose snakes have upturned noses not downturned noses as raptors do thus meaning they dont even have hooknoses as the author of this article describes thus making their inclusion truly puzzling  I use quotation marks because neither snakes nor birds even have noses in the sense of the ones humansprimates have Snakes smell by using their tongues and the Vomeronasal organ inside their mouths a snakes nostril holes are used only for breathing Some venomous types use their additional larger nostrils actually glands called pits to sense heat not odors
The fact that such noteworthy intellectuals as Ashlee Simpson and Paris Hilton have recently had rhinoplasties does not even mean that they had or have socalled hooknoses Nor does the fact that a fictitious halfmanhalfungulate creature living under a bridge in Kentucky supposedly has one though Wikis article on it makes no mention of a hooknose nor has it of course ever been photographed It bears pointing out that factors allowing the genetic merging of ungulate and human DNA apparently intrigue the pseudoscienceoriented authors of this hooknose article 
Overall no tangible factors make the term hooknose worthy of its own entry in a factbased 21st century encyclopedia other than as a disambiguation page redirecting to an entry such as Pseudoscience  This is a textbook example of an unneccessary article manufactured out of several disparate and unrelated sources by using a smoke and mirrors technique  Why not just merge it into Nose and let real scientistsdoctors hash it out rather than secluding it in its own peripheral entry based on pop culturehearsaynonscience  Hooknoses are an I know it when I see it type of thing with no set way of being measured  If it were quantifiable by a certain mathematical formula then it would possibly qualify for inclusion here  For example if a nose is downturned by an angle of precicely x degrees or more in relation to its main slope  But no such formula exists  It is a purely arbitrary colloquial term with a different definition to everyone  For example everyone has a different definition of fat but there is a medical definition of obesity calculated using a Body mass index formula   There is no such formula for noses  Additionally the link given to wwwnewadventorgcathen12620bhtm does not count as a reliable source as it is a religious nonscientific organization making dubious and unreferenced claims  For the record I am white agnostic and have a small to medium nose with no hook I was attacked and called a vandal by user  after flagging this page for deletion and thus I felt it necessary to respond
