Im playing around with using a timeline box like the one I did on Henry Minett Very much a work in progress but you get the idea The dilemma is that certain things in the box should be in the article and the last thing I want is to try and boil down a career into such a simple list Possibly having such a list on Sebree would allow me to skip in prose some of the less interesting postings But at the same time its hard to have a full view of his life in the prose if you skip large portions of it
