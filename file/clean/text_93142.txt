Personal attacks in edit summaries 

Hello IllaZilla I do not particularly care if you want to attack me in edit summaries as you did here  Im a man in his thirties like you and I just shrug at this kind of stuff In a way I even enjoy it But do be aware that not everyone has this attitude so it might be best to keep kindergarten stuff and similar comments out of edit summaries OK
