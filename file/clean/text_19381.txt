Apparently the part where I dont take any side in this matter is lost on you  I am not endorsing the current version as better  Indeed if I did revert it myself it would imply that YOU are somehow right because I took a positive action to put the article in YOUR preferred state  I am taking no action  See WikipediaProtection policy where it says When protecting a page because of a content dispute administrators normally protect the current version  I am under no obligation to put YOUR version of the article up any more than I am to put HIS up  If this is unsatisfactory for you then seek outside opinion at WPDR  If lots of other people who have never worked on the article before agree with you after that process the article can be changed talkcontribs
