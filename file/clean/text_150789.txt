I have found the holy grail 

Browsing around on the Louisiana state library and Ive come across the holy grail of signs Its got cutout US routes cutout diamond Louisiana routes with a black top ironically enough curves and detours and old fashioned stop signs Makes me want to jump back in time for a week steal some then bring em back
