Thanks for the laugh Amusing how most of the history in that seems ok but spun by the apparent belief that anything other than YEC literalism is atheism Some obvious errors or distortions such as Though studying for a degree in theology Darwin put his greatest energies into  geology FitzRoy was an opinionated conservative Anglican It is interesting indeed that on the long voyage young Charles maintained a  reputation for being a biblical literalist  at that stage FitzRoy was ahead of Darwin in supporting uniformitarian geology and the CofE scientific establishment was not biblically literalist OEC is closer The mix of theological ideas was much more complex than our literal freinds seem to think And he delayed publication of the Origin of Species for 17 years eh it took him that long to research and write it  Just as well that our article is based on credible biographers such as Moore its worth reading Evolution and Wonder  Understanding Charles Darwin To cite from your link We Christians must as a part of our faith boldly reassert  the Lordship of Jesus Christ over all things including science And it would appear truth   talk
