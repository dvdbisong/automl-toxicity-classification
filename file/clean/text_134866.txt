Hmm All I know is that another user Blue Tie quickly reverted from your edit back to mine before I even knew your bot had smacked my edit down I didnt know that sites in a certain domain Angelfirecom were prohibited or that they qualify as spam links but now I see that Angelfire is on the banned list so I thank you for pointing that out  But can you explain to me why the Angelfire link was removed that one time yet remains on there after the other user added it back  It seems that your bot would remove it each and every time or does it only work one time  It seems like a pretty inefficient bot if it gives up that quickly  Perhaps you could elucidate Or you could just reprogram the bot to be more ruthless if thatd benefit Wikipedia in the long run 

Thanks
