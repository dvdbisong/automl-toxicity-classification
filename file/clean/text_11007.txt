Your edit to Matt Bevin claimed that the information provided was biased Its not biased to tell the blatant truth Matt Bevin was criticized for lying about his position on health care  theres no pretty way to say it If the statement is deleted like you had done then its hiding the truth or whitewashing Whitewashing is dishonesty and deception which is unbecoming of a civilized person Also the way you phrased to stop putting people on Obamacare sounds like a 10 year old wrote it  if youre going to edit articles please use proper grammar in other words dont write the same way that Donald Trump talks
