Insulting to Geographic Information Science
ive not seen one person argue with your view statistically speaking however you have basically besieged an entire field of research with your views Nvj are you a statistician neither am i noone is accusing you of being wrong get it learn how to write an academic article perhaps I highly dislike your edits of spatial dependence for example you draw the discussion of a valid field of statistics geography topology and topography and turn it into an argument against kriging Im sure that there is a conspiracy group somewhere that you may participate in eg I think it is all because of the freemasons however geography is a serious science the applications of which im certain that you have not truly studied or understood currently I work for the government in the analysis and creation of geographic information while i can appreciate your argument on kriging i do not believe that it belongs in the majority of articles concerning GIScience related topics as that is what geostatistics is Personally I do not use kriging in the limited analysis that i do perform I prefer the triangulated irregular network or the distance weighted average
