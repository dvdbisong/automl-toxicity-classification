Im ambivalent on this particular issue On one hand the content doesnt convey direct information on Muhammad and is therefore not essential to the article Consensus matters and clearly there isnt consensus on including this image and so it should be out On the other hand Im strongly offended by the view of some Muslim editors here that Wikipedia should in any way adjust its presentation to be Islamic While Islamic law may prohibit Muslims from depicting Muhammad nonMuslims shouldnt be pressed to follow Islamic customs Naturality in the spirit of civility even nonMuslims shouldnt engage in presenting works or content that denegrate Muslims or Islamic customs This image however does not seem to be intended to denegrate Muhammad or Islam in any way and therefore its unreasonable for Muslims here to be so agitated by such images The image shouldnt be included in the end since there isnt consensus Im not happy with the idea of giving into fundementalist muslim mentality though
