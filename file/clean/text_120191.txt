Ive created Ciske de Rat and made a redirect from Ciske the Rat film as both films are mentioned here Later they can split into 2 articles Im sorry if my english is not perfect I could upload a film poster or record cover which is nearly the same as the book cover with additional picture of the film There are a lot of fairuse pictures here and it says on Nonfree content page that it is not set in stone and its an essay The goal of the image is to show the book and the character like in other articles
