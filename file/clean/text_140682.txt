German Ship Prefix of Donau 

Hello Im planning to write an article about the Donau in German But can you tell me what the german Ship prefix is
Is it the international prefix SS or the german prefix DS Dampfschiff  Steam Ship I also have a source that writes MS for Motor Ship
but I think its wrong because the Donau was a steam ship
