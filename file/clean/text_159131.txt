Slogan
The slogan is Thats why mums go to Iceland  I just saw an ad on TV But who is the celebrity Is it a pop singer  

Its former pop star Kerry Katona

Maybe thats the slogan they use now but there is no doubt the slogan they used back in the day was Thats why Mums gone to Iceland  

Still is  I went to an Iceland this morning and this slogan is still plastered everywhere April 2007

 Copyright issues 

A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website
httpwwwicelandcoukiceinstorensfwebsearchtheicelandstory
as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article but rather to notes on the original page Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy  

Almost certainly not If it was thered be some WPOTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit As it is Ive removed it for its blatancy  

Name change
Its my understanding that the overall name Icelandcouk was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting  the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with tinternet around 20012 was stock market poison

 Iceland International Stores 

I started out on this search knowing without question that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain While merely knowing isnt good enough it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about nonUKIreland stores  This is what I was sent by email upon asking the company directly through its website

I can confirm that Iceland do have a number of franchises overseas However we do  not hold this information for these stores here Please feel free therefore to visit wwwoverseases for further information

I have fixed the internet address from the preceding paragraph to  Click the Store Locater tab and eventually 4 stores in Spain notwithstanding the text disclaimer at the top of the page referring only to stores in Tenerife will appear on a map of Spain   

 Refs 

Both references are identical Surely only one is needed
