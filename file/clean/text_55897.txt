I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre Vermont  When you type that do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city  Admittedly its not the most convenient but thats the way it is in all eight town states  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation  If so go ahead  but unless you so desire dont try to have one or two changed  You speak of errors that result for example the Oyster Bay disambiguation page  I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this but I dont see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link  If you never make mistakes thats good but I suspect that you so do  So what  It doesnt matter if you make a goodfaith error especially if you try to fix it once you realise that somethings wrong

By the way if you put Oyster Bay New York into the Census Bureaus Factfinder youll get this page its the town  Barre Vermont is similar to what wed call a disambiguation page the city is listed as Barre city Vermont  This I expect is the reason that these articles are named this way the Census is our source for the names and the basic information and therefore we entitle our articles likewise by this reliable source
