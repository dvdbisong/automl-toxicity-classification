Silent Consensus About Reality 

This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks

silent consensus about reality

Perhaps the phrase silent consensus about reality has a clear meaning in the jargon of some school of thought but I have never encountered it before and have no idea what it refers to  Id like to see this rewritten or expanded so that its comprehensible by the average person or removed altogether  Since I have no idea what it means Im not able to rewrite or expand it and Im loathe to just delete it since it has survived many other edits and therefore presumably means something to others  

The phrase was added by SpecialContributions85127205253 85127205253 at 20090131T032725  Can that person clarify what they intended to say  Can anyone else offer an explanation
