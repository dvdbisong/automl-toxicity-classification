WikipediaArticles for deletionList of films receiving six or more Academy Awards 

Yikes  I just happened to run across this today  I did not know that this debate had been going on  I suspect that the article will not get deleted just by looking at the current comments  Even if it does get deleted our revised Table in that other article List of Academy Awardwinning films will cover all of these bases  Do you agree
