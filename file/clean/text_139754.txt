Look in life some things are subject to individivual opinion Political persepctives for example  we cant predict how human beings will behave so nobody really knows whether left wing or right wing approaches are the best way to run societies But we can predict how brick walls behave when they are hit by things So this issue is not one of the things that is a matter of individual opinion Its not about whether you feel like engaging me in a subjective debate The description of events on the page at the moment is physically impossible and refuted by all available evidence 114 foot Airliners cant fit in 27 foot holes This is not my opinion this is a fact Its also pretty comical that the current description is refuted even by the shamefully inadequate collection of images on the CNN link Because this site relates to such an important event the fact that your account is so physically indefencible is a disgrace It is your job as an editor to sort this out
