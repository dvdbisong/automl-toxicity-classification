Maybe I made a mistake but FisherQueen still blocked something I was on when I just said patiently that my blog was more reliable than most sources on this site which is true because you get your info from sites that sometimes do not have any thing to do with the makers of the films

To FisherQueen

I am sorry that I told you that you were worse than one of the worse people I know but if you saw the worst person I know you would laugh in relief But there is the fact that before I said that you blocked me because of unknown reasons Please tell me why I was originally blocked just because I said that my sources were reliable and that I did not like being called a girl

To All of You

I realize that I wrote stupidly but there is still the fact that my film is very well written and will be in theaters most likely Also FisherQueen is not very patient because she blocked me for no apparent reason My page deserves to be up as much as the Bloons page deserves to be up and the pages for stuff that isnt even as far along as my film is Taking down the page for Sammy G wasnt too smart either because he has a promising future in rapping Maybe I should not have put up one for me but that one and the one for my movie did not need to be deleted The film is very likely to get into theaters
