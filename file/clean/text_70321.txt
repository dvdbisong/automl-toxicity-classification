Gustworld said As a regular user of Wikipedia I figure its only fair that I contribute as well In 2008 Im trying to consciously do some Wikipedia editing each day as a form of community service

I work as a journalist and editor in Australia so my corrections tend to either involve fixing grammar and expression problems adding some global perspective and information to UScentric articles or tweaking around the edges of popculture related articles

journalist oh things are looking a little clearer now hahahahaha sad act
