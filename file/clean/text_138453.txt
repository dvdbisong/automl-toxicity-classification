Machu Picchu
Hiya just as a second opinion from another admin I wouldnt call the actions of  vandalism see WPVANDALNOT  I do agree that the block was appropriate since they were editwarring and not responding to talkpage messages but I didnt see anything from the IP that looked like a deliberate attempt to compromise the encyclopedia  Ditto with the protection notice at Machu Picchu  Protection was appropriate but it might be better to change the reason to editwarring rather than for vandalism Would you have any objection to my changing the message onka
