Censorship
Science Apologist
   I do not know of any Wiki rule or policy that gives one editor the right to censor the contribution of another editor If you have a problem with the contribution I am trying to make to the Clairvoyance article please intelligently and articulately communicate your concerns on my Talk page Simply clicking on Undo as you have done before is not science It is censorship If it continues I will have to commence DR action Best wishes RAmesbury
