FPC for Kurandosan
Ive noticed your bot has been moving FPC older than 14 days  Would it be possible to extend its operations on FPC  I understand that it wouldnt be able to determine if an image should become featured but it could do the rest  What I was thinking was this
For old nominations we can manually determine if it should be promoted and place the phrase PROMOTED FILENAMEJPG or NOT PROMOTED on a new line in that subpage and move the link to the subpage to the bottom of the current archive link to that archive is determined by WikipediaFeatured pictures candidatesCURRENTMONTHNAMECURRENTYEAR
Your bot could then determine if it was promoted or not and do the following
If the image in that subpage has FPC or fpc in its summary remove that tag and replace with FeaturedPicture else just add the FeaturedPicture tag Any other images displayed on the subpage should have their FPC or fpc removed if present
Add the following new line to WikipediaGoingson below the line which reads WikipediaFeatured picturesPictures that gained featured status
ImageFILENAMEJPGNAME_OF_SUBPAGE CURRENTMONTHNAME CURRENTDAY
where NAME_OF_SUBPAGE is the name of the subpage where the FPC took place without the prefixed text WikipediaFeatured picture candidates
Add the following new line to WikipediaFeatured pictures thumbs below the first occurrence of  on the page

Determine the person who nominated the image by either grabbing their first sig on the subpage or probably better grabbing the first edit of that subpage
Determine the person who uploaded the image probably should use the most recent upload of the file the one at the top
Add the following new lines to the bottoms of these two individuals talk pages
FPC
PromotedFPCFILENAMEJPG
If the subpage says NOT PROMOTED remove the FPC or fpc from any of the images displayed on that subpage people might on occasion link to an image so be careful Image versus Image 

This would cut our workload by a large amount and all we would have to do is make sure we put PROMOTED FILENAMEJPG or NOT PROMOTED at the end of the subpage and list the promoted pic on WikipediaFeatured pictures visible and WikipediaFeatured pictures  I think this is all the work you would have to do but I may have missed something   0228 5 Apr 2005 UTC
