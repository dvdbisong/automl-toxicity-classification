Bad crap 

What bunch of crazies wanted connection to the Force to be mystical instead of genetic Movies like these shouldnt be mystical Its about the happenings in a fictional galaxy not some weird spiritual garbage The only time it should be spiritual is if it were referencing Christianity and referencing it correctly at that  0148 9 Jun 2005 UTC

I for one am an atheist and dont believe in all that spiritual crap myself However I think that mysticism in stories makes them much well better It also enhances the theme   0224 Jun 9 2005 UTC

How does it do that  1526 24 Jun 2005 UTC

Scorpionman what makes you think that a movie should only be spiritual if it references Christianity and not another religion   দ 0734 9 Jun 2005 UTC

I suppose that depends on your point of view Im not relativistic but when it comes to things like science fiction theres no need for spiritual stuff  1526 24 Jun 2005 UTC

In fact I was disappointed when I learned that the Jedi use some mystical substance that cant be measured scientifically It would make more sense for me if they were just highlytrained concentrated people   1421 20 Jun 2005 UTC

The Jedi dont really use the midiclorians The midiclorians just connect them to the Force and the Force is what the Jedi use   2304 Jun 20 2005 UTC
By some mystical substance that cant be measured scientifically I mean the Force Im quite disappointed by its very existence in Star Wars   0646 21 Jun 2005 UTC

I dont really think it needs to reference ANY religion Science fiction is science fiction If you think it needs to reference Islam thats your opinion  0330 22 Jun 2005 UTC

I dont think he ever mentioned Islam   0014 Jun 23 2005 UTC

I am not sure to whom the anonymous editor was referring I dont see any reference to Islam either and I suppose this discussion isnt really relevant here anyway But for the record I have no problem with spirituality without reference to a specific or alreadyexisting religion especially in something like Star Wars where the connection of the humans to us is obscure since it takes place during ancient times in a distant galaxy I was responding to Scorpionmans odd in my opinion comment that movies should only be spiritual if they reference Christianity instead of other religions I personally think its better to stay away from specific religions   দ 0200 23 Jun 2005 UTC

I really would rather have it not reference spirituality but my weird comment stating that it should only reference Christianity is my point of view I know not everybody agrees but I really would rather it all be purely technological and scientific  0155 24 Jun 2005 UTC

The Force is a power that can not easily be conceived my young padawan We must learn to harness its energies let it flow through us Only then can we become one with the Force   0213 Jun 24 2005 UTC
