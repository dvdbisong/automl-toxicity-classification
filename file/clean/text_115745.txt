Info box image  current composition 

The image House of Lords currentsvgpng is out of date because it shows UKIP as having only 2Lords David Stevens Baron Stevens of Ludgate has since joined the party from the Crossbenchers Editors seem determined to constantly change the 3 back to a 2 because the image displayed has 2 purple seats The image is wrong and is clearly causing too much confusion for editors to cope with therefore it should be left out of the article until some1 decides to amend it Just to confirm UKIPs 3 lords are David Verney 21st Baron Willoughby de Broke Malcolm Pearson Baron Pearson of Rannoch and David Stevens Baron Stevens of Ludgate Please see that this mistake is not made again If we are to include an image it must be correct as I say it is clearly causing too much confusion 13088114129
