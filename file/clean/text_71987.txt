Please do not correct misspellings in quoted material when those misspellings are marked with sic for instance in the Nuwaubianism page which you have incorrectly corrected three times now  

Oh dear I am terribly sorry about this I do occasionally fail to notice things like this at first and have to go back and revert myself but I really should have noticed this by the third time If anything else I should have remembered that I had already edited the page twice before also the sic is clearly visible next to the word Having made more than 5000 corrections of this type  999 of which are hopefully useful  I sometimes get into the habit of not always reading everything through properly before I change it I add all the pages that I change to my watchlist which I do occasionally scan for reversions of my edits but unfortunately this plan has backfired somewhat as there are now over 5000 pages on there and its difficult to pick out anything useful from the mass of unrelated changes

Once again my apologies for the annoyance I have caused and thanks for reverting my changes To be on the safe side I have made a note of Nuwaubianism and not to change it for this word I will take extra care if it comes up in other searches
