publicly hosted Web sites for sharing digital photos But is it safe to share

personal photos  After all personal photos contain personal information about

you and your family your interests and hobbies

mugs imprinted with the photos Members can share their photos by sending

friends and family the URL of their photo site Sometimes visitors must enter
