You know Im leaning more and more towards Rogers opinion here knowing what we know about the sources I think its implied that IBM reinvented DC but its not unambiguous and its really not such a critical point to this article  I think we should just say that IBM was aware of differential cryptanalysis but didnt publish it at least in this article the proper place to get into this in detail would be in the Data Encryption Standard article or the differential cryptanalysis article  juicetalk
