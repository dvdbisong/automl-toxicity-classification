I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested
As for the leftright thing it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered right wing I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff ie totalitariansm etc and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology Neither of those is contradictory to the lead Fascism arose during a fragmentary transitional period and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements Its probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to national syndicalism should facilitate than oversimplify
Regarding the deleted material I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context and sourcing It should be borne in mind that the WWIIera fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasifascist Japan formed the axis for example so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me though ethnocentrism sounds plausible Just because it sounds plausible however does not mean that there are RS describing it as such Militarism is a common thread but how does monumental architecture relate to that The sentence seems somewhat forced so there has to be a concrete source connecting those in an intelligible manner 連絡 見学迷惑
