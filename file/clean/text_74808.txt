Kvens are indigenous to todays Northern Norway

Thank you kindly user   

The user  may not understand that the Kvens are indigenous to Northern Norway in my view anyway and many of the best experts seem to agree  We are not moved by the personal assumptions andor believes of the user  but science instead of course as you seem to agree 

The user   Please read the related writings from this columns archive  The Norse are not indigenous to the extreme Northern Norway of today  The Kvens are  The Northern Norways Tromsa area alone has at least 12 prehistoric Kven place names 

Historians and linguistics experts have been able to come to this conclusion for instance based on the words and spellings that were used prior to the time  andor during the time  when the first NorwegianNorse immigration to Iceland took place  The relevant sources have been given in this forum for instance KVENLAND  KAINUUNMAA 1986 by the Professor Emeritus Ky√∂sti Julku 

Where are your sources for counter claims user    Do we only have your personal narrow view point which even appears to be based on no sources at all  If there are sources behind your views what are they in relation to this matter for instance  

The related and quoted experts  earlier mentioned in this forum  are not basing their views only on the writings of Ottar or Alfred the Great or Tacitus or any other before mentioned or not mentioned historian or other scientist writer or leader alone of course  Ask yourself for instance who might be behind the prehistoric jewelry hidings that have been discovered only recently from Inari not that far from the coastline of the Arctic Ocean 

Examine and read more  Only after having done that make your own conclusions not before please  In the meanwhile let the experts make their conclusions based on all the material and sources they have available  Wikipedia is here to reveal the findings of science not the opinions of yours 

  It is generally accepted that the Sami people are the indiegenous poeple of Northern Norway I am aware of the history of this article If you read the article you will notice footnotes such as this A reference These are the references for the paragraph you are reeading When you click on one you will get the reference list A link is provided for most articles I suggest you read the article being referenced and either start discussing my interepretation of the refered article or the content of the refered article For the later you need to provide your own references

Your view is not a generally accepted view at all but only your view

We hope you agree that it is not reasonable to request for us to have to provide evidence to everyone separately  Please check the archive for the beginners 

There is a reason why we are asking for the exact quotes and exact  easily verifiable as Mr Mikkalai put it  book and page information from you  The reason is that simply showing a list of authors and books proves nothing  Wikipedias vandals and foul players are known to resort to exactly this sort of tactics  

Once again  The sources offered do not agree with the text written in the Kven article   To understand this you only have to read the last comments by the user Drieakko  As everyone can see he continues backing up from his statements  In different ways he goes on appologizing while he attempts to round of his false statements  What does that prove  This is only a learning processs to him  He really doesnt have anything to contribute to this topic except for chaos  

User LabongoDrieakko  It is your job to show where exactly someone  a respected and known historian or other scientist  agrees with your text  The burden of proof is in your hands to show evidence  Please include exact quotes and page information  That is how Mr Mikkalai wanted to proceed after a recent concensus was reached 

We are quite familiar with the related material in question  We have provided our sources in detail you have not not even a single quote with a matching book and page information    Steve Wondering

 Please stop pretending that this article has no references Show what reference matches the current text  show even a single such source to begin with  What
