Re FarmSanctuary Images 

Thank you for the compliment for calling me The Image Master though I would disagree and say there are others around here that are much more knowledgeable about images and policy But anyways I only found 6 images that he uploaded  most were just uploaded over an existing file I couldnt find a source for ImageGene Baur 2jpg and ImageGene Baur 1jpg so you can see the Better Source Request tag I put on there and notified the use to provide a better source for the images The main confusion is that if you look at this image page and it will state  Please feel free to use this image with credit to Farm Sanctuary But if you click on the Click Here for a high resolution TIF they state not to use for commercial uses which would be incompatible with our policy Also confusing in the matter the user has a username that implies they are a part of this organization along with their userpage that states as such The image on their userpage was uploaded by someone else though who is interested in the same topics and has few edits anyways I would say they are the same person Lastly the image on their userpage ImageFarmSanctuaryJPG has a unique message Ive never seen before about OTRS that says they gave permission I asked on IRC and the OTRS folks said it was only for that image but it seems they would be likely willing to license the others if asked My guess Email the folks at the foundation and ask them to do what they did for the other image for the other 6 images that this user uploaded You could list them under Possible Unfree Imagedisputed its a bad name using PUIdisputed and follow the directions on the tag though I doubt it would get as much attention as I have given it but this is the standard method of dealing with these things I think talk
