Thanks for the pics of the Pope etc I dont think those crowds are anything like the size of the Indian crowds that prem Rawat attracts and a newspaper photographer wouldnt be allowed on stage with Prem Rawat Publicity isnt the intention whatever some may think Not sure what you meant by that characterisation but the text makes it clear that these articles are not press releases if thats what you meant The reporters describe their impressions of the crowds security measures taken etc And work I have to get out of the house and earn a living thats all
