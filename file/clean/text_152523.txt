I see your point that depending on the first single and how it turns out will pretty much make or break the 3rd movie I will not however list RavenSymone as a former member since in interviews the group confirmed that Raven was not part of the group Galleria was part of the group on screen group of Cheetahs I honestly think that the fictional group of Cheetahs should have their own page I mean really the group was not a real group until the trio recorded I Wont Say Im In Love The fictional group sang on the soundtrack but so did the group from the 20022003 Josie and The Pussycats movie but they were not a real group The group of four Cheetahs is a fictional group but since there is a real group which includes 3 of the four fictional members the song is wirtten of as theirs
