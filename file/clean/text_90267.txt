I am not taking issue with the fact that you are removing a language from the page and replacing the languages blurb with an administrative languages blurb What constitutes vandalism is the repeated removal of large sections of text multiple paragraphs at a time from sections such as Background Furthermore it would be more appropriate to move the two languages you continue to cite to an Administrative Languages blurb and include the rest of the languages beneath that in a blurb called Other Languages or something to that effect

Your version of the page removes the following sections from the article in their entirety

     Background
     Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya
     Conquest of Magadha
     Emperor Chandragupta

Thats why we keep on reverting it Blanket removal of information from a Wikipedia article constitutes vandalism You make it sound as though all you are doing is removing Aramaic from the article this is not the case If you continue to remove major portions of the article I will be forced to report you to WPAIV which is something I very much do not want to do Please make the article a collaborative work and stop misleading other editors with your edit summaries
