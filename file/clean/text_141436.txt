Comment to anyone reading The above distinction is now moot since it was decided to remove automatic Olympic medal categorization via TemplateMedalGold TemplateMedalSilver and TemplateMedalBronze due to undesirable lack of sort key in those additions  So now all 3 pairs of Medal templates are equivalent  all they do is format the row of the medal table and nothing else  So it goes   Of course who knows what the Olympic Wiki project people may think up to do retroactively to any page that uses TemplateMedalGold etc so its still safest to use TemplateMedalGoldGeneric for nonOlympic medal tables   talk 2151 31
