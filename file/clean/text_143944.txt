Effectiveness of Lamictal 

That section appears to be wrong Lamictal is effective at Prophylaxis or delaying the mania depressive or rapid cycle It is not effective more than a placebo in current state of either of those You can read citation 8  httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC2580079  whereas I think I read it and understand it more than whoever wrote that line Lamictals own perscriber guide says it is effective at DELAYING any of those three INCLUDING RAPID CYCLE mania It published those two studies It did not publish the studies that say it is not effective at treating CURRENT any of those episodes  httpusgskcomproductsassetsus_lamictalpdf  please agree somehow to fix that section 1735518122
