No problem Its possible I guess that weve both missed it somehow but until someone can find a link or something to confirm its existence I was inclined to leave it out Isnt it odd btw that the reporter in Newham Recorder obviously was too coy to admit that both Rosen and Alan Gibbons are childrens authors and none the less notable for that Certainly they have recently campaigned together against Gove on educational matters but to do with teaching literacy AFAIK rather than religious bias
