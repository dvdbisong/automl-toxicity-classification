I read what you have written The problem is that you dont understand what you are doing You dont know about Republic of Macedonia and you are not qualified to write about it
Now just not qualified but you are also promoting offensive material
Naming Macedonian to be a Bulgarian or claiming his parents were Bulgarian or his last name is a Bulgarian is an offense
Same as when someone names you as a Bulgarian to be a Tatar
Please keep civilized
