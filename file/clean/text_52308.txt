Gunner POV 

The remarks about gunners seem to be unreasonably negative Whether or not a student is overly competitive is subjective and it is probably reasonable to leave it as is However it also suggests that the answers that gunners volunteer are usually incorrect which I dont think is the case Many student are simply dedicated and do know the answers they may be considered gunners by those who are not as dedicated Those gunners who are also ignorant of the subject matter are probrably in the minority 1421325238
