Dear fellow Wikipedian Youre previous edit to some article I will never visit again was unconstructive You didnt actually change anything at all Doing such edits is distracting and eats up bandwidth which is not free Also sometimes when it rains outside you can watch the bodies rise up out of the ground in the cemetary of off Governess Drive If you look really closely at a snowflake you will realize that the circumfrence of a watermelon has nothing to do with the escape velocity on Uranus However that realtionship is much concrete when we speak of the astronomical body otherwise known as Urmomsanus Plus you have a tiny little piece of wallaby DNA in your genome right now Apparantly according to an inside source God duh one day back in 60000000000000000 BC one of our ancestors mated with a wallaby and now all humans have this one wallaby gene which allows us to benefit from the new pound shedding weightloss supplement If you our any member of your family needs to loose weight just use the wallaby gene idiot Problem solved No more questions in life just relaxation and collecting the money as it comes puring in So if you are ready to do this then I am too Its nice to be able to count on you like this and i feel we are just starting to get to know one another
