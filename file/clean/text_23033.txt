Mallaig Extension Railway 
Does the Mallaig Extension Railway really qualify as a Historical Railway given that

 its still open from end to end and
 its actually of quite recent origin relatively speaking

 

I think it does Having worked along the COR and up the WHL to Fort William Banavie Peir came to mind and the Invergarry and For Augustus Railway For completeness I felt it is relevant Linking into the NBR and then onto the LNER  detail still to be added Loch Eil Outward Bound is a station that is not included The West Highland Railway is another issue that need thought  for the same reason
