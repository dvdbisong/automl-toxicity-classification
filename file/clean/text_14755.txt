In some parts of Canada the situation is legislatively divided into warring US and British camps  For instance in British Columbia and Alberta Doctors of Podiatric Medicine DPM still exist In Manitoba Saskatchewan Prince Edward Island Nova Scotia Newfoundland New Brunswick Yukonand NWT standards are slightly higher and are based on quackerybased charlatan British Chiropodists who insist on calling themselves Podiatrists In Manitoba for example about 15 or so quack Chiropodists insist on titling themselves Dr despite having bogus 34 year qualifications This disgusting Manitoba movement is designed to blur the distinction between British Chiropodists and USA DPMs In the province of Ontario MAJOR differences in scope of practice exist Consequently there is still a title distinction between UK chiropodists and USA DPM podiatrists  ie American Doctors of Podiatric Medicine Unfortunately both share a governing body the College of Chiropodists of Ontario To accelerate Ontarians into confusing US trained podiatrists with bogus UK podiatrists the British Chiropodists who are in greater number heavily lobby the provincial Government regularly into perpetuating  maintaining the banned prefix Dr and the associated title podiatrist Unbelievably and quite maliciously British Chiropodists have lobbied provincial legislators into forcing all USA DPMs who migrate after 1993 into accepting and only using the title chiropodist This is plainly maliciously designed so that the Ontarian public cannot distinguish the vast difference in educational qualifications The APMA  ACFAS is now studying this injustice and blatant discrimination
