Hi adding my thoughts here While you are welcome to your opinion of Mannings gender it is not germane to the title discussion and the guidelines we developed in advance of the discussion suggested that we keep such opinions to ourselves That said I would ask those writing here to consider dropping similar notes on the pages of those who share their opinion that Manning is a woman as that is not a valid argument for a title change either
