Your talent at invoking personal attack seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points

If you cant take the heat you shouldnt be editing an encyclopedia  Its pretty clear that Wikipedias personal attack policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree and prevent them from making contributions to Wikipedia while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse  

To illustrate this point we need look no further than the items removed by Jimbo from the Justin Berry talk page citing personal attack which included every mention of the term camwhore which is itself a Wikipedia topic and the following paragraph  Please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the personal attack here

Im dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted most likely because one of the editors is a selfadmitted pedophile Is it fair to declare that a pedophile cant be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia I guarantee that wikipedia wouldnt ban a Jew from editing a page on the holocaust or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks Wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit If that doesnt include pedophiles than how is that fair If we allow certain sexual minorities to be silenced whats next allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well As a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia I only want to read factual neutral POV articles and I dont care about the race nationality ethnicity sex or sexual orientation of the editor Even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules  TAB 

You people talk a good game but what you say and what you do are two entirely different things
