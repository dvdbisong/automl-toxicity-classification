Hey Acuman I have read your previous claims and you dont have any clue what you are talking about yet you insist on pressing your personal opinions  Ahmadinejad consistently refers to the Zionists and NOT Israel  Also phrases like Israel should be WIPED OFF THE MAP are inventions of Zionistcontrolled Western media  Ahmadinejad never said that phrase and what he was referring to which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to the usurping regime of Israel should be eliminated from the page of the world  one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be wiped off the map but that is not what Khomeni had originally said  Nonetheless Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media in my opinion Zionistcontrolled Western media suddenly blew it way out of proportion for obvious reasons  The history of this article clearly shows that it has been obssessively manipulated by a disproportionate number of Zionists their edit history shows they are Zionists  Anonymous Iranian who used to oppose the Islamic regime in Iran but is now 100 supportive of them
