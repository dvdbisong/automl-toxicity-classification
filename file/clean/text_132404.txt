All done As you will see though I have removed some of the sources you originally added for various reason The Radio Disney source didnt lead anywhere just to a radio request page another source was a blog blogs arent used as reliable sources on wikiepdia and I have also amended all the sources I have also added fact tags to part of the content and have added an Infobox Things that could be added include birth dates and place of birth as well as images and so on It is important though that any content comes from a verifiable source Have fun Talk
