NHHIts all about what a man can or can not do NHH You can accept that this article is about a historical militaryadministered territory officially named Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia or you can not Me I can ignore your PA comments but I cant agree that the title should be changed to any phrase that doesnt refer in some way to this said territory which is the subject of the article Savvy
As for your grammar concerns you should probably make it clear which classes of words you consider too irrelevant to enter our considerations Though I certainly hope you are clear on the difference between the words of and in and how they may alter the sentence As in I was sick of this one year ago and I was sick in this one year ago 

FkpCascais Oh please Fkp Its me The Im insulted he hinted Im a nationalist thing is so old it has a beard as we say round these parts I know you so long I can produce a halfdozen diffs at any time to show an editing pattern as the one I hinted at And no this isnt a fake Serbia like the NDH was a fake Croatia it was a military occupation zone in Serbia the Serbia referred to there is just a geographic qualification indicating where this entity is located in You need to clear from your head all that NediÄ‡eva Srbija nonsense that they teach us in grade school The Serbian article actually has a flag and coat of arms under an infobox title that says Serbia and you just called this a country Ill say it again this is an occupation zone created by Hitler where his army picked some willing stooges to run the police and collect taxessteal food Hitler hated Serbs with a passion and didnt give them anything even closely resembling a country It takes a special kind of crazy to go around fighting for recognition screaming hey dont you go denigrating Serbia we were just as much Nazi puppets as you were Yet that is exactly what Ive been reading here for years on end So forgive me if Im a little sick of it

Peacemaker I challenge your assertion that there is no WPCOMMONNAME for this territory and claim Military Administration in Serbia is a name used on a wideenough basis to qualify as such   talk
