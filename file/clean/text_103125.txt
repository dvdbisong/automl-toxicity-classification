PROD 

I just deleted a prod tag from this page for the following reasons
The prodder didnt give any reason for deleting the article 
There are no obvious problems with the article  it is well sourced etc
The prod was likely bad faith based on the prodders comments at WikipediaArticles for deletionBarnegat Fund Management and User talkDjbarnes  The Barnegat Fund Management article whith which UserDjbarnes has a potential COI was deleted for lack of notability and now the user is prodding other hedge fund articles without giving reasons
