First thank you for your efforts I looked at it at lower resolutions I started at 100 then at 110 then 125 In all those the Signpost is to the right of the ToC and all the others are below the Signpost When I go to 150 the Signpost drops to below the bottom edge of the ToC but still at the right which is OK but the Archives painting and links box are all below the Signpost It would be nice if at 150 the painting could be at the left side with the Archives and links box to the right But if thats too difficult Ill just leave it as it is
