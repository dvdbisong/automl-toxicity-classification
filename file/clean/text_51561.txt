Official Notice 

I am posting this here per WPADMINABUSE as evidence that I have taken the step of attempting to resolve the situation by talking directly with the administrator in question I have been here just under 2 months I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project and until this incident enjoyed my time here very much This has been a nightmare and I very much wish to put it behind me However as a matter of principle I feel I must continue to do what I feel is right even though it would be much easier to just drop this and even though I have very little chance of ultimate success I realize that to err is human Im not looking for your head on a platter Im not even looking for an apology I too am human and far from perfect In the time since the incident I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner The fact is that while I may very well owe an explanation andor apology for some of it it has nothing to do with the original block You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me Without veering off into another topic as far as why that is only partly true the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasnt done You were the one who blocked me and it is only you from whom I can request accountability In earlier comments youve made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators I however am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me the common user who was affected by a decision that you made It remains my position as I have said before that I did not deserve to be blocked You blocked me for violating WP3RR 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule Furthermore you stated on my talk page that I should have stopped reverting and attempted to gain consensus on the talk page WPBLP states that violations should be removed immediately without waiting for discussion My actions were in line with WPBLP and did not violate WP3RR Therefore I am formally and respectfully asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith you erred in judgement when you blocked me I thank you for your time and await your response
