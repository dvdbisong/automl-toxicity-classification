I agree with the first poster in this topic Ive worked for YEARS in the topic of Russian  Soviet media no qualification here nor can I really be arsed to prove it because it was a question of passion over substance in my eyes either way I have been deemed an okayish critic of biased textswellyou know I laugh in the face of those who call themselves unbiased and your wiki pompousness Grow some self awareness Or at least a bearable level of cynicism Christian1985s attitude to the Mail is far far from unbiased Ive read his additions deletions comments carefully In addition the fact that numerous calls for a controversy area have been silenced is far from unbiased The fact is without a controversy section an article about a controversial paper is not complete Christian1985s lack of acceptance that a controversy section may be necessary suggests a frightening bias and narrowmindedness that distinguishes his contribution to the page and dear Collect goes AGAINST the very ethos of wiki that you suggest 8110438217
