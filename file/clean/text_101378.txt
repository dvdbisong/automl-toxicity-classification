Well thank you for finally having the courtesy to participate in the discussion In response 1Yes I agree that there is a perception of overlap between ALSF the yls and so forth This perception however is an inaccurate one One only need do factiva searches on the hostility between alsf and the yls in the 1980s and 1990s for instance Indeed in some states liberal students and young liberals have nothign to do with each other still In contrast to the YLs the ALSF is not considered part of the Liberal Party and the party has no authority over it If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this clearer on the ALSF page I shall be more than happy to take this on board 2Stating that the YLs and Liberal Students in NSW have worked together and held joint functions does nothing to counteract what i just said I fail to see the relevance Furthermore were talking about joint functions between the NSW Liberal Students Association and the YLs not alsf 3Most importantly what on earth does this have to do with the issue at hand regarding Macquarie Uni I really cant see it Again I ask is there ANYTHING in the media or anywhere other than with two Wiki editors that links the actions of Victor to ALSF If you can find something please put it up ill retract all my comments I just honestly cant see how it is relevant
