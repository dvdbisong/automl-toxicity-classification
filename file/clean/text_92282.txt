No Lists of top ten venomous snakes dont belong in ANY encyclopedia including Wikipedia These kinds of lists belong maybe in a childrens book Venom composition is not static Even within a single individual it will vary in quantity and relative proportions of components over time Greater variability in components is seen between individuals of a species greater still between species Further venom continues to evolve often very rapidly so there may be wide variations in venom composition and toxicity within a single species over its geographic range This is especially true for widely distributed species and may cause problems in antivenom effectiveness Factors involved in the variation of venom and its toxicity include diethabit variability seasonal changes geographical location agedependent variability genderdependentsexual variability altitude and the list goes on Then youve got the research methods used This can be critical as some snakes produce many venom components but eject them sequentially rather than as a uniform mixture The immediate fate of the venom after collection is important particularly in relation to environmental conditions that might denature certain components The storage of the venom is also vital and exposure to heat may cause damage to certain toxins Prolonged storage in liquid form may damage others Pooled venom may introduce many variabilities because each pooled batch of venom will contain venom from different specimens compounding both intraindividual and intraspecific variability There are many potential variables in such research that may affect comparability and interpretation of results The choice of test animal may be crucial because each species may respond differently including humans The choice of route is also critical The standard test of toxicity is the LD50 Mice are most commonly used The LD50 remains the most universal standard for determining and comparing toxicity of venoms As an example the rough scaled snake Tropidechis carinatus has a much less potent venom than the tiger snake Notechis scutatus on LD50 testing in mice Yet clinically the two venoms are virtually identical in the type and severity of effects on envenomed humans There are many examples just like this across all species The black mamba is not the most venomous snake species in the world but it untreated human moratality rates are 100 and produces death in the most rapid time To compare the manybanded krait has a more potent venom on mice but doesnt produce the same devastating effects on humans the way the black mamba does Many more examples are readily available Mice arent humans Yes they may give us an idea on toxicity but they arent the same as humans Talk to me
