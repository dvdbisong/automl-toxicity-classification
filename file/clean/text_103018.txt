Origin of Afshin

Dear Atabek
Some of the sources mentioned are not scholarly or outdated
What are the qualifications of these authors relative to Bosworth Bernard Lewis and Daniel Pipes who did his work on this topic D Pipes Turks in Early Muslim Service  JTS 1978 2 8596  

Note I am talking about the qualification of these
A

What is the scholarly qualification

C
Chisholm Hugh 1910 The Encyclopædia britannica a dictionary of arts sciences literature and general information The Encyclopædia Britannica Company p 48 ISBN 0742562964 httpbooksgooglecombooksidSv8tAAAAIAAJpgPA48 Motasim made Afshin a Turkic prince who had distinguished himself already in the days of Mamun governor of Media with orders to take the lead of the war against Babak  

1910 is outdated  

D
Glassé Cyril 2008 The new encyclopedia of Islam Rowman  Littlefield p 80 ISBN 0742562964 httpbooksgooglecombooksidD7tu12gt4JYCpgPA80 the Turkic general Afshin subdued Babak by taking the fortress of Badh in 222837  

The person is not a university academic

Please provide justification on what level these sources are on the same level as Bosworth Bernard Lewis and specialized article on Turks in early Muslim service
H M Balyuzi  G Ronald the University of Michigan 1976 Afshin was of princely descent his ancestors having ruled Transoxania and he was not a Turk but an Iranian

I dont think we need mediation on this issue but I see no justification for given the same weight for academic sources as nonacademic sources
