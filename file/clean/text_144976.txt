Making the majority into the minority 
Though there has not been a claim of responsibility previous bombings in Lahore have been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban because of their disagreement with minority interpretations of Islam such as Sufism5

I would like to know when the Barelvis became a minority in Pakistan It is the largest sect in Pakistan Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis then simply read an article about Barelviswhich is insufficient and at parts incorrect  like many other articles here They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belongspeaking on the individual level Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi sufis are considered our elderly our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge Barelvi  Sufi more or lessto simplify things for the reader People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah waljamatthis would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as  unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors This is the largest sect in the Islamic worldno quotation  simply based on experience and personal research where sufis are considered as mentioned our elderly our sages our spiritual guides Hence sufis are not some sect but simply our respectable elderly The sect is called Ahle Sunnah walJamat An ok translation would be The people of the Sunnah Unlike Christianity the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad saw mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one  which shall happen to be the largest onefrom the hadith Again seek out the source if you are interested Its in the major Hadith collections Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity  If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufisbarelvisahle sunnat waljamat Then simply take a look at Sindh I dont have the exact number but its like 9095  sufis Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis But that corresponds to ca less than 10there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects of the total population in Pakistancensus 2010 How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy
