This smells like Chris Lyons is phoning in another one of his canned cutandpaste objections to an addition to this article full of unsubstantiated babbling about NPOV and NOR and coatracking Here is the quite well documented facts about how Proposition 8 is described 

The way its proponents describe it Since this for them is largely a matter of posturing and semantics  because their own people are completely unaffected by the results of the measure  their interest in the subject pretty much ends with the passage of the measure They can say marriage is only x because their own people are prohibited from ever expressing something other than x the demonstrated behavior of Ted Haggard and many if not most of their own people notwithstanding It for them is largely a demonstration of power and status of ostensibly being able to call the shots by social and political means by calling for purification of society as they in their fantasies imagine it should be no matter whose bodies happen to be in the way Gives a whole new meaning to the Pentecostal chantsong about under my feet

The way the people who will have to deal with the aftermath of the measures passage describe it Since the Attorney General has to enforce the law once passed the Attorney General titled the measure so that what happens after the election is quite clear certain peoples rights that existed before the election were eliminated Since the people proposing the measure arent ever going to be in that class or so they believe they dont care about this or even care enough to allow the suggestion to pass  that the lives of people will be affected That goes for editors here who are proponents of the measure who are fighting against any measure of Proposition 8 in a way that might actually hint that individual people are going to be affected by having their rights eliminated Yeah they dont care about people outside their churches except as potential converts as notches on their bedposts to be manipulated at will against their consent unless and until they get their butt in church They call this love of course in case you were wondering what they think that word means

Describing it both ways which would be the equitable way of dealing with the situation as documented

Describing it in neither way simply linking Proposition 8 to the article about it

After two months of having to restore the ballot title eliminates the right of samesex couples to marry to the Proposition 8 article in the runup to the election and having sat through one of the satellite simulcasts promoting the measure clearly this is how its proponents think They seem to live in a peoplefree universe that nobody will be affected by it and demand that any description of the measure that actually mentions peoples rights must be scrubbed That is what certain editors want to continue doing here Justifying this scrubbing and elimination of the mention of realworld consequences of the measure is not NPOV Its attempted scrubbing of dissenting views to which I object in the strongest possible terms As for COI your insinuation that anyone objecting to Prop 8 here is a directlyaffected by the common standards of the proponents evangelical community dirty diseased queer whose edits must be blocked or questioned on the basis of a COI just shows exactly where your prejudices lie
