I find the 2015  Kansas City Chiefs vs Baltimore Ravens action at the end of the first half not only missing a source but also lacking in terms of the definition While the play was amazing it didnt lead to a tie not even a tie for the half time but only to a reduction of the lead from 247 to 2414 and the game ended up 3414 for the team that didnt use the play Sorry but Id suggest moving this paragraph to the section about List of passes often mistakenly referred to as a Hail Mary whereas even the often part would need verification
