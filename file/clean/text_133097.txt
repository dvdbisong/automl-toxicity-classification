hensel pic
The issue isnt who the picture is OF but who owns it If Ansel Adams takes a picture of Tom Cruiess car at the mall and you steal it and put it on wikipedia its Ansel Adams who has a right to get pissed off Tom Cruise doesnt have anything to say about it In this case the Hensels owned the photo in question so that was why they got to make the decision not because it was a picture OF them 

see my comment on the hensel article talk page about the Life mag pic
