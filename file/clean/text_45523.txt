I see more than one point of view on he issue but what precise idea would you like to put in about apas and what sources do we have to work with because as it was it was a bit controversial If we called it just an androgynous system it would be fair to the refs and make sense too but its not really approachable but then apas is a bit complex either way For the china section its just to point out the similarities or the design influence and the overall objectives of the Chinese to make their system compatible how you say it so long as it is not controversial is up to you They didnt steal it they didnt directly exactly copy it but they intended for it to be 100 compatible As far as I know it is it just needs the rendezvous and a mission plan neither of which will be forthcoming The Chinese are happy to cooperate with everyone and smile sincerely whilst he Americans pout and point fingers and try to spook them with the minime shuttle up there right now    1518 21 Jun 2012 UTC
