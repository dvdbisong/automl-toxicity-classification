UPittIT Block 

Hi Orangemike

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editors responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns as Hammersoft had pointed out and editors lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editors user space but the repeated violations are disconcerting In fact I cant be entirely sure that the user account is only one person a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy However it is my understanding that editors are not in WPCOI solely due to their place of employment or username but rather because of the issues of POV reliability and neutrality of their contributions However in this case my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox the now deleted  issues this had not been demonstrated because all of hisher work as far as I know had been confined hishers user sandbox The editor was an obvious newbie and had twice sought feedback see here and here and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links downsizing of the article rewriting so it was not in violation of WPNOTDIR and the addition of outside neutral thirdparty references In fact although I did not see any of the editors additions to this particular article since July 7th in my opinion it contained useful information was notable and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper Mostly I would request that this page be restored as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the offline references from various library science journals that had been inserted I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue and your review of the DScribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated Thank you
