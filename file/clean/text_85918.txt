Wikipedia relies on its readers and volunteer contributors to avoid or challenge and correct misleading or false information

The following has been called to our attention

1  The statement that read Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents calling it a waste and fraud cited as its source an article at this address by Bovard httpwwwenterstagerightcomarchivearticles1000americorpshtm  Nowhere in that article does Bovard make that statement  No mention of AmeriCorps NCCC nor of the National Civilian Community Corps appears in that article nor is AmeriCorps NCCC called a waste and fraud  We regret the error

2 The same sentence went on to state the following  Bovard has been one of the most vocal Americorps NCCC opponents calling it a waste and fraud in addition to dedicating an entire chapter of criticisms of the program in his book Feeling Your Pain 

Upon investigation this statement turns out to be untrue  Bovards book published in hardcover by St Martins press does not contain a chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC in the book Feeling Your Pain  In fact neither AmeriCorps NCCC nor the National Civilian Community Corps are mentioned at all in the text of that book nor in the book index  The chapter in question concerns the umbrella program AmeriCorps but does not mention the program known as AmeriCorps NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps

The only mention to NCCC is in the footnotes referring to a speech by thenpresident Clinton praising not criticizing the NCCC

In sum the book Feeling Your Pain does not dedicate an entire chapter of criticisms of AmeriCorps NCCC contrary to the information posted at the Wikipedia website  We regret the error

3  Also untrue was the sentence Robert Sweet the former director of the National Institute of Education labeled it ie AmeriCorps NCCC a fraud  This sentence was misleading and false  It was placed at the National Civilian Community Corps page and referred to the antecedent in the previous sentence the AmeriCorps NCCC

The claim relied on the article by Bovard at httpwwwenterstagerightcomarchivearticles1000americorpshtm  No mention of either the National Civilian Community Corps nor of AmeriCorps NCCC appears in that article  No evidence has been put forward to support the statement that Mr Sweet ever labeled AmeriCorps NCCC a fraud  We regret the error

Wikipedia deeply regrets that this misleading text appeared at our National Civilian Community Corps website and that it persisted for as long as it did

The editor responsible for its appearance and continued reemergence will no longer have access to the National Civilian Community Corps Wikipedia entry

Philippe  Calls to move forward on the National Civilian Community Corps page to be a team player etc would be better received if Wikipedia posted a note something like the above at the NCCC site   not to mention it might restore Wikipedias credibility on the subject  I dont know if there is a snowballs chance of that happening but at least this gives you some information to process so you can evaluate the current situation  Given the nature of the NCCC  a substantial and serious component of US disaster relief and mitigation capacity  and its recent neardemise following misleading claims like those posted at Wikipedia the statement above is not written as amusement
