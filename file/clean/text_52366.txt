Not only that its also bad Gaelic Im almost 100 convinced this is made up and not historic I think the only time Ive heard the Shetland mainland spoken about in Gaelic was on BBC Alba as Tìrmòr Shealtainn but again thats not historic as such and just a literal translation of Shetland Mainland I think until we can establish at least modern usage via BBC Alba we should go without a Gaelic name
