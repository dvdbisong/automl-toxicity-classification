Please do not put false information 

How dare you those people who switched alana and mels names for nathan and tylers names when i looked a few days ago Seeing Nathan and Tylers namea on the eliminated list nearly made me so angry How could they have done so well and then failed But then I realised that Alana and Mel were not eliminated as shown in the latest episode Now I check today and everything is as I thought Nathan and Tyler were NEVER eliminated So those ppl who put up false information please the table of elimination results should not be messed around with
