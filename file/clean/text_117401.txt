The publishers description is actually an excerpt from a previously published review by Shane Pitkin Barden  The excerpt of the review  description reads

The Violin Diary relates two love affairs  one with a woman one with New York Both seem to mirror the authors perception of The City that Life in New York always seemed to be moving back and forth up and down  up and down back and forth like violin notes notes that are impressively changing and always dramatic Perhaps what is most memorable about this story are the thoughts Norcross poses and then ponders And there are myriad statements that gave me pause when I read them some because they are concise gems others because they document simple gestures that hint of epic proportion when I tilted my perception ever so slightly While The Violin Diary on the surface is a compilation of memories it is really about ones heart where it starts where it ends and everything in between Its the journey  the everything in between  that matters most because it is what truly defines us httpmultimediareviewsblogspotcom200810violindiarybyericnorcrossreviewbyhtml
