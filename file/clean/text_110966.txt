Confusion 

Hello  You have made a series of unusual edits to articles such as Alexa Vega and sun tanning  I cant figure out your intent  You seem to be attempting to revert these articles to previous versions but you dont explain why and your edit summaries are misleading claiming youre reverting back to a particular version but instead reverting back to a different version  If you are doing this intentionally stop you will likely be blocked if you persist  If you are doing this inadvertantly I invite you to please learn more about how Wikipedia works perhaps starting at WikipediaIntroduction  Thank you
