G Edward Griffin is not a very reliable source to depend upon for quotes  If someone can actually trace the alleged Forbes quote to an authentic original source then that should be used to replace Griffin as the source  Otherwise the quote should be taken out if it cant be verfied from a more primary source  Griffin Eustace Mullins and several others connected with them used to run a cottage industry of faked quotes and some of those still circulate  Unless one can track a quote down to a more dependable source it shouldnt be treated as authentic coming from them
