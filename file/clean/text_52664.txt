Definition of islamophobia
I think the root cause of problems is the disagreeance between Axon and me about the definition of islamophobia Axon wants the Runnymede Trust definition of islamophobia to be held as universally valid while I want the dictionary definition to be used 
Axon and other users argue that because the Runnymede Trust definition for islamophobia is supported by a wide range of international bodies and governments it is universally valid
