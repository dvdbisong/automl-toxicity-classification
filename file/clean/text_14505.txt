Hi Hanna Simpson Thank you for the message I tried to clean up the references you added Just for reference theres nothing wrong with citing nonEnglish sources as long as they satisfy WPRS but if you do then its sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WPRSUE This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter See TemplateCite webQuote Translations do not have to be professional quality They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article 
Regarding COI you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talkMaterialscientistOttoneum That doesnt mean you can never edit the article but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make COI editing is not expressly prohibited but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WPPSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are Of course what you know about the museum is true but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject The information on the museums official website is considered to be a primary source so its usage is rather limited Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it Rather articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something So any sources you can find which discuss the museum and are independent of it would be helpful
