Indeed I expanded a couple of bits of Bishojo game because thats where the terminology discussion already is including a definition of Visual novel Does that look okay If so the only other question I have is whether the redirect at Visual novel would be better pointed at Bishojo game where the definition is or at Renai game much closer in concept Can the redirect point straight to the Terminology  genres subheading  1519 Jul 15 2004 UTC
