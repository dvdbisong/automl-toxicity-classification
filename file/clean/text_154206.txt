Theres no conflict a court martial can end with other sanctions and the party demoted in rank as Whitman was The court martial did effect his views on the Marines as his diary shows At the time of his discharge it was his wishes and for the convenience of the Marines according to the records The Marines gave him an honorable discharge Of course this is unverifiable even though I have all of the Marine Records FBI records Medical Records Police Records Texas Department of Public Safety Records interviews with Whitmans professors friends victims and a few members who were in his Boy Scout Troop when he was a Scout Master in Austin So I am not qualified to speak on Whitman in the article as the history on the article page will show Also my interviews with Martinez and McCoy are audio so they cant be used either because of WPCOI and verifiability even though my name is used in a few of the sources in the article on Whitman Hope this helps with your contradiction concerns Cheers 989414683
