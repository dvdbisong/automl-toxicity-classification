Thank you  yes I agree about the merge Im not a Marylin walker though do regularly climb Garway Hill and others in the Brecon Beacon but agreed about the Garway Hill link as well There are fascinating stories about the Hill  I will try to get one of my friends who lives on it to write a starter

I had noted the use of Preceptory in Abbeys and Priories  I believe this to be incorrect  it should be Commandry in this case  but Im no authority I will ask our local expert I will also try to get some other info about all the villages around here up and running my wife is the vicar of Garway and a number of other villages  hence the link to the community website I did the Garway one first because of all the enquiries we get about Knights Templar and Garway Church and no they cant dig it up to find the Grail whatever Dan Brown says
