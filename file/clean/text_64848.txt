Taiwan 

Whoever labeled Taiwan a Province of China needs to get over it Taiwan is its own country now You might be offended by the fact they have more liberty than people on the mainland but your opinion does not change the fact that Taiwan is no more a Province of China than the Philippine Islands are a Province of the USA or New Zealand is a Province of the UK Get over it Taiwan is an independent country and apparently most Taiwanese want it that way
Taiwan Province of China  is the ISO name for TaiwanROC This article is merely repeating what they say as they indirectly name the ccTLDs Your issue should be directed towards them not here    Talk   contribs
