Cement trucks 

Hi I wonder if someone could answer a couple of trivia questions 1 Is there something preventing concrete from hardening in those rotating cement mixer trucks or are they just hoping that theyll get to their destination in time  2 What happens if it does harden in there  Do they just discard the barrel or is there some way to deconstruct it and get it off the concrete plug  Thanks
