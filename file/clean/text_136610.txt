fringe

 far too much and far too pov

if POV means not NPOV i challenge you to identify text which isnt presented neutrally ie not favoring a side but neutrally stating other peoples opinions then lets improve that text

 fringe theories shoud not have so much space

per NPOV All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view representing significant views fairly proportionately and without bias

a view that is mentioned in almost every discussion of the topic should be described fairly and in proportion to the attention it receives

 the addition was entirely promoting a singe point of view

a view that was not previously missing from the article

 provide arguments against as well or its povpushing

the 43 Environmental impacts section does just that but if there are specific points that should be added or changed i encourage further targeted development demanding perfection in every edit seems inappropriate
