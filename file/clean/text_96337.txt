I have agreed not to mention others by name but presumably the intelligent people in this group can see that I am both the primary international proponent for Open Source Intelligence for 20 years training and nurturing 7500 and it is both lunacy and immaturity to contintually delete my constructive additions  As one person notes on the history page even through I am the author for several of the seminal works no other person on the planet has written all the main english language handbooks or the seminal articles in the mainstream published literature or the two seminal works in TIME and Forbes web pages this is solid constructivce information that should not be dismissed

I ask that the person continually undoing my modest constructive work be himself blocked and that my specific contributions be locked in so as to end this foolishness  I spent five days developing this page a few years ago and my work was destroyed by vandals from CIA from one especially stupid journalist pretender and from Wiki trolls who delight in deleting and do not have a clue about the actual subject matter

The editing wars on this page and the obvious bias inserted by CIA people who are in denial are what is responsible for the complete lack of interest in this page  There are no fewer than NINETY government open source units around the world and not a single one of them has bothered to enter information here because this page is regarded as being under the control of idiot Americans who are selfcentered and care nothing about the real world

So you all have a choice we can make this page real and internation or you can let it revert to irrelevant incomplete and largely incorrect

Best wishes Robert Steele
