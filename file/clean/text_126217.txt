Did I type wrecking  Like the ball  Thats bad  So much for proofreading  Im trying to proofread more onwiki because Ill look at what I wrote later and it will be littered with apostrophes and random craplike I forget vowels when I type and I add apostrophes to every word possible so then I have to take them out and if I type to fast my letters get inverted  Its awfulI feel so uneducated looking at what Ive written two seconds ago  Especially the apostrophe thingbecause that really kills me when other people dont know what to do with one so to just have them floating about like ballons seems just terrible  
You know I have to find some way to use havocked now dont you  Maybe I can have Cossacks havocking because that rhymes  Twould be rather awful though    talkÂ  2253 June 4 2007 UTC
