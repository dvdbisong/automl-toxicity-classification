Comment on correlation 
The year 140 AD is leap year so if Thoht 1 is July 20 in 139 AD
it is July 19 for the next 3 years all 4 years claimed as the rise of Sothis
The year 2773 BC is likewise a Thoth 1 on July 17 whose previous year is July 18
4241 BC is a July 19 date for Thoth 1
As for correlation placing Egypts earliets dates as 2170 BC and 2030 BC and 2001 BC etc
the date for Thoht 1 is Jan 6 in 2001 BC and the winter solstice
The wprt name for new year has been used for sothis but also for solstice
and not clear whether winter or summer Connecting it to Nile flood doesnt help
when the myth of Noahs flood is at winter solstice Further if Thot is the 7th month
then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt
Example reunification in year 955 If Flood is year 600 and Noah dies in year 350
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created
If using a 360day calendar for those 350 years then from year 600 it is year 955
Unification of dynasties 15 is then the same year and event for dynasties 610
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340 but in LXX in year 768
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty
lets say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 versus 8th month 22
we have Paopi 16 on Jan 6 so which is the wprt sopken of in record winter or summer sothic
