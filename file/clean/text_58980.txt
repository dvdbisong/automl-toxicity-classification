the generally accepted cause of the death of Adolf Hitler is not mentioned in two different versions of the article you and I were editing you put in The 1992 opening of records kept by the Soviet KGB and Russian FSB conflicted with the widely accepted version of Hitlers death as described by Hugh TrevorRoper  my bolding which replaced the former word confirmed With an explanation on the talk page I changed it to largely confirmed It is important to mention that most people thought Hitler had killed himself in the bunker long before the Russian archives were opened for example The World at War episode 21 Nemesis Germany February  May 1945 and that events were reported in most English language histories as TR described them and that his escape was by the middle 50s thought to be very unlikely by most people although a favourite parlour game which used to be included in this article was to say if Hitler had survived he would be insert age I added the sentence with cadaver to the article back in May 2006 one of the advantages of using the word cadaver was that as a summary of a source I used it removed any possibility that it was wpplagiarismplagiarism and another advantage is it is accurate However although I prefer the word cadaver in this sentence if there was a consensus to change it to corpse I would not object
