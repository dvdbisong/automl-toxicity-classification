tennis expert and bad behavior
Tennis expert is beyond a joke  his behavior is consistently atrocious he act like god and chief censor he never backs up any of his edits with common decent argument He accusses any one who challenges his edits as  vandalism he defends the indefensible he censors criticism he is constently rude to other editors he should be banned he is a bully boy who redits any edit within minutes nobody else does this he is reknowed for getting in edit wars see tennis statistics and he is consistently rude to other editors see remarks to carlo coluusi in jimmy connors and german friend in rod laver He has been a rude menance since last november His behaviour is awful I may have used rude language but as far as ium concerned rude uncvilised behavior is far worse he should be stopped hes  the one starting calling every redit of his work incvil vandalism when it was nothing of the kind hes the one who did the silly edit of removing lavers total wins year by year abosulte nonsense this man is so arrogant and look at his name his ego is gigantic petty he would drive anybody to bad langage and aggressive remarks he should be banned ask carlo and german friend about his behaviour
Thyis man is a liar nobody else has backed up his edits  what a joke he is a minority of one the tables were perfectly consisent and sensible back in october before tennis ego arrived
you dont put citations when the info comes from the main sources as this silly man has been consistently requesting  and you dont put incitations when the source is obvious  ie rod laverss quote after a match obviously comes from his press conference this man has driven me up the wall with his stubbornness you should get evidence from other witneesse before bowing to the snide requests of tennis ego I was not even aware this page existed or I would have complained about him long ago
