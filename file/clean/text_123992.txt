Please fix minor typos in httpenwikipediaorgwikiFrank_Sanello 

 please Ill try to be brief as ordered by a Wiki editor who described my Talk entries as verbose I thought I was just being thorough 

I ran the latest post of httpenwikipediaorgwikiFrank_Sanello through Spell Check and found the following typos Please fix Thank you very much

Under the heading Libel suitn at attorney William Skrzyniarz last name is misspelled without a y httpwwwmerchantcirclecombusinessBillSkrzyniarzLawOffice3107868207

other typos I make myself all the time even tho I get paid to copy edit mss written by others

For some reason many people including me accidentally repeat the same word consecutively

Please fix

consquently sic

the jury ruled in favor of the THE sic publisher

libelled  British spelling 
libeled  American spelling

Wikis editor used the British spelling Is that kosher In the British editions of my books the publisher used unauthoriSed biography instead of American unauthoriZed biography

Please fix unless Wiki accepts British spelling

England and America are two countries separated by a common language  GB Shaw httpwwwquotationspagecomquote897html

Hitler is misspelled in Works and references as The Autobiography of Frau Adolf Hitlter Translated and edited by Frank Sanello Hitlers name is misspelled several but not all the time

This is very analretentive and unimportant Im embarrassed to mention this in fact but I know Wikipedia is a stickler for formatting and facts

The correct capitalization of my book is Reel V Real not Reel v Real as listed in Works Please use a capital V in Reel V Real httpwwwamazoncomReelVRealHollywoodFictiondp0878332685refsr_1_3sbooksieUTF8qid1374239624sr13keywordsfranksanello

BTW your OpenLibraryorg also uses a lowercase V in Reel V Real if youre interested Im not  only about Wikipedia 
httpopenlibraryorgworksOL2620052WReel_v_real

Some kind Wikipedia inserted this irrelevant unnotable fact in  httpenwikipediaorgwikiFrank_Sanello 

An advocate of frei kultur or free access to information the author has donated his early books to OpenLibraryorg which notes that his Reel v Real is part of the library collections of Yale Harvard and Temple Universities The MLA Modern Language Association APA American Psychological Association Turabian and the Chicago Manual of Style have cited his work Sanello has registered with Project Gutenberg in order to submit his books to that freeaccess site as well

nonsenseferret was correct in saying the MLAAPATurabian citations were insubstantial All those style manuals do is preformat bibliography and footnotes in all books submitted to them by OpenLibrary Please remove this unimportant info from  The MLA Modern Language Association APA American Psychological Association Turabian and the Chicago Manual of Style have cited his work   

Editing my Wiki bio has been a huge education for which this 61yearold computerchallenged man is very grateful to Wikipedia for forcing me to learn software code  or whatever

While I was patrolling my own page I learned I was listed here
The first reference in my bio refers to my age and cited by a site Id never heard of  Frank Sanello OpenISBN Retrieved 15 July 2013 httpwwwopenisbncomsearchxfrank_sanello

Openisbn lists all my 19 books and punctuates Reel V Real correctly  but the site like OpenLibraryorg has incomplete info about my books especially OpenLibrary When I have time between my own books right now Im Kindlizing my screenplay about Eugene Bullard the first AfricanAmerican military aviator World War I Ill update all my books on OpenLibray and OpenISBN Thanks again Wipedia for promoting my career LOL

Wiki already has an article about BullardhttpenwikipediaorgwikiEugene_Bullard After the Kindle and CreateSpace paperback editions of my screenplay about Bullard All Blood Runs Red I will cite the hell out of it on Wikis Bullard article to promote the sale of my paperback screenplay because Wiki always displays first in most searches Ill include Wikis Bullard articles URL with my book cited in an updated edition of my Bullard bio which can be easily updated on Kindle or CreateSpace with a few key strokes 

BTW Im amazed Wiki accepts books published by CreateSpace that is selfpublish
