Id agree with this I dont really see them as being pop at all Sure pop in the sense of being relatively popular and leaning towards the more accessibleradio friendly end of the alternativeindiepostpunkwhatever scene but not pop in the sense its applied to music as a genre in its own right  taking the Pop music page on here it doesnt really describe Franz Ferdinand all that well There are aspects which could be applied to them but they clearly dont fit amongst the examples that page gives of pop artistssongs As above the source doesnt actually call them pop anyway but art pop whatever that may be
