Something as necessary to a scientific theory as falsifiability ie it is not a theory unless it is falsifiable absolutely needs a peerreviewed journal article There are articles that cite other methods of falsifiability these are not the methods those article cite so what am I missing  
Allow fair discussion and I wont vandalize  In fact as long as you stop deleting portions of our discussion I wont touch the article at all If it is consensus that the article can be improved as suggested then someone else can fix the article but I wont touch it  This is a discussion page so allow fair discussion If it is a consensus on Wiki that my concerns are invalid then I will accept that consensus In fact if there is a arbitrator for discussion employed by Wiki I will accept their verdict but I will not accept arbitrary deletion based off of an invalid reading of the rules That is not in keeping with the spirit of Wiki
