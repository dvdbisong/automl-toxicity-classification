AfD comment 

This is a great weekly podcast which should not be considered for deletion  Kevin ShuddyBoy and Geoff have great guests and have a show format that is originally and has yet to be duplicated 

This is a great podcast with many notable guests Hollywood directors New York Times best selling authors The Dragon I think you need to re think what Wikipedia is about This is not a joke Its a podcast that while extremely silly is more than deserving of a Wikipedia page No independent coverage If you google search Mad Scientist Party Hour all of the hits are for this show You need to rethink your position on this Shakes    Â Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  
Hi Shakes I removed your above comment from the AfD since it was added after the discussion was closed All article topics on Wikipedia need to have significant coverage in multiple reliable independent sources  The other hits for Mad Scientist Party Hour might be independent of the main site but the point is that we dont have enough secondary source coverage to use to write an article As it stands the article would rely fully on sites without vetted editorial control If we cant find basic secondary coverage the article topic doesnt have the potential of ever being well researched to a sufficient standard for an encyclopedia article czar
