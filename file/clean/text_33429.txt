Your Personal Attack On My Talk Page 

 Im not entirely sure why you got so angry to the point you felt the need to personally attack me I am not angered really just more or less confused and amused 

 As someone who writes for ProWrestlingInsidercom and has a good relationship with Dave Scherer Im also amused you would knock my knowledge of professional wrestling All that anger you carry around is unhealthy my friend I feel very bad for you and look forward to maybe having a more civil discussion Do take care of yourself
