Hazel Eyes 

Hi I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information Ive numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as its informing people that hazel eyes can be goldbrown and green either could be dominant which is a myth as a hazelnut doesnt contain any significant green colouration whatsoever it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight browngold admixture that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so as in Europe the origin of lightcoloured eyes and hazelnuts the trueoriginal meaning is still used The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the mythmisconception in North America came about its more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture as the colour hazel because theyre multicoloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they dont resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way Its an issuemyth that requires common sense to understand really so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sourcespictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour hazel is described as being

I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour hazel was by William Shakespeare in Romeo  Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut Mercutio Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyeswhat eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel Act 3 Scene I Romeo and Juliet

Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intensionpurpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and goldbrown mix or any multicoloured eye blue grey or green with brown around the pupil as a hazelnut doesnt present any blue grey or green colouration nor is the colour hazel described as possessing any of these colours I only hope youre more understanding of this issue and can agree with what im saying I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understandknow about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isnt green or gold in any way its actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil the hazel eye section doesnt say anything about haz
