Taiwan viral marketing scandal 

The idea is to have a summary version of what should be covered more extensively on the Samsung Electronics page
I have supplied two reliable sources in English but the summaries I provided of those have been altered in a manner that deprives the reader of important information so there is a need to discuss that 
Further the quote it had not interfered with any online product evaluation report and had stopped online marketing campaigns involving posting or responding to messages in online forums is not a quote from Samsung but a quote from the source indirectly reciting what Samsung said on its Facebook page without quoting Samsung So it is misleading in its present form as it appears to be a quote from Samsung The other source meanwhile does directly quote in quotation marks a portion of the statement made by Smasung on its Facebook page 連絡 見学迷惑
