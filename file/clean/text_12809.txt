Height of One Madison Park and Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower 

The quote At 617 feet 188 m it is slightly taller than the landmarked 614 feet 187 m Met Life Tower across the street and dominates the skyline looking south from the park seems to be incorrect The wiki page for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower and the emporis page state its height at 700 feet This would also be consistent with it being the worlds tallest at the time it was built in 1909 Does anyone have further official height of the Met Life Tower
