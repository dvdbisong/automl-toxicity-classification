HI Sarah  First I changed from Gfwesq when I realized my husband was still logged in  We are not sockpuppets and I would never attribute what I say to him  Thus I changed it  I wish there were some other way of identifying independent users than this but I dont know how  

Second I removed the sections that were factually untrue and that were judgmental and inflammatory  including where I quoted the same paragraph to show the authors bias  This is per the WPBio guidelines as the tag says on the talk page
