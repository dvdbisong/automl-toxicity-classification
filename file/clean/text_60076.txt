WikiCup 2015 FP nomination 

Hi there just to let you know that Im checking with the bot owner to clarify why you didnt get the bonus points for the image you submitted appearing on five or more Wikis as of 31st December 2014 From my count it was on exactly five and now its on six  once the bot is updated it should pick it up straight away
