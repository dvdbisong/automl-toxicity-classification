I want to echo reading over the reliable sources guidelines The problem is that almost all of the sources you added to the article for Devil Shit are inappropriate for Wikipedia in general in various ways Merchant sources such as iTunes are wildly inappropriate to use as sources in any way shape or form Their primary purpose is to sell you something and regardless of the information they impart they should never be used as a reliable trivial or even primary source Secondly the YouTube links are almost entirely unusable as many are not uploaded by the people that created the music or represent the artist This is seen as a copyright violation and its also something that shouldnt be linked to In almost every case the only time you should link to a video is if it gives notability which none of these do Thirdly the rest of the links are primary which will never ever ever give notability Never You could have a primary source that establishes that someone won a Grammy for a devil shit song but it still cant give notability You should only list primary sources after you have a reliable source posted by a noninvolved second party The other problem is that with a lot of these sources the claims of devil shit arent backed up in the actual source For instance this Twitter account doesnt say anything about the artist creating anything in this music genre Saying that the artist performs devil shit based solely on the Twitter account is considered to be original research You need reliable second party things that back up the information but even then you have to understand that verification that the genre is performed by notable or nonnotable persons is not enough to show notability for the genre to have an article A genre can exist but existing is not notability Even if you readd all of the sources and the performers without Wikipedia articles that wont show that the genre is notable If anything it actually does a little more to injure the case here than to show notability If you have 80 sources all of which are unusable for notability purposes and most of which are linked to performers that dont have articles which many automatically presume means nonnotable even if this isnt the case then this tends to make many automatically assume that the topic in question is less notable which means that they might not search as hard as they otherwise would Its not right that this happens but it happens Sometimes in AfDs less is more
