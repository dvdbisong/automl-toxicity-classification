As I have said if scholars ie commentators and obviously not primary sources say that Boia is wrong because cite them if other scholars without entering a dialog with Boia draw different conclusions based on the same primary sources cite them What you have added there is basically But I Daizus could just as well say say that Boia is wrong based on my love for reading or whatever That perspective is unencycopedic and contrary to wikipedia norms
