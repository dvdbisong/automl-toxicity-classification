The preexisting Anaheim photo is fine It isnt nearly as blurry as your claim it is and it is completely acceptable for the purposes of identifying the subject Your opinion may be biased because its your photo thats being reverted Why change to a photo from a team he played a handful of games with and is quite unlikely to ever play with again when theres no major upgrade your opinion excluded in the quality of the photo The bottom line is that an NHLrelated photo is more appropriate and theres no need for a change Unless someone can upload a newer quality photo in a Senators uniform it can stay as is IMO for the time being Lets talk about it
