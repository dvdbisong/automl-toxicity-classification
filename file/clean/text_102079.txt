As  could be clearly read here I wasnt asking for any unblock but to talk to Tawker so unless you had the intention to contact him for me or to contact me directly I dont see why you have put your finger in it
Please any other admi coming here do not remake the same mistake and give my smoke signals further to the rigth target Tawker
I dont care about being unblock I do care about being treated as a person and been given acomment and else that outsiders dont mingle in a case that they do not know a single thing about
Being reverted for not adering 100 to all mormons theories is in my view a direct attack to the first amendement
Here are some proove for what I have advanced in some of my edits I have edited from the 10th of june 2006 in the evening to the 14th of june 2006 in the afternoon with being subject ton unfounded personal attacks and reverts without explainations from my first edits Both from other editors all mormons and from administrators who were also mormons
As you are not an administrator and not the one this edit VERY VISUALLY is adressed to so you should have step away or contact the person himself to ask him to take a look here
your actions in that case are counter productiv Pgk and waist my time and place in wikipedia 
Try to bode for this or use it as a learning stuff for future times
Do not make the mistake of using your previous type of experiences in vandalism as a stonehenge model for all situations
Take into account the basis and what actually occured in the case at hand and that the people who generated personnals attacks against me did it without having been subject to such on my part and only by assuming things about me who werent true
Even when confronted with that fact they pursued their personal attacks in form of racism and accusing me of lying and calling me a troll and all their edits stating those have not been removed nor do those editors have been sanctioned nor even warned
Most probably because they appeal to mormon administrators to begin with
I have written contributions in only 2 days before all were reverted without explainations That i was blocked on the basis of NPA is a cynical joke as I thad tried for days to make the other editors to stop agressing me by answering my edits with personal attacks and to instead adrees the content of those edits
I have in all my answers to them specifically and always adress the contain of their edits directly and accuratly that it had contain also similarity with personal attacks has to be seen in the ligth that their edits were made of 90 of personal attacks and false allegations about my motives and source of informations thought i had clearly stated what those were several times and even was falsly citated on words and sentences I had never uttered
The feeling of being done wrong was growing for each of those unfounded attacks and instead of getting clear and founded and logical responses I was confronted with further illigetimates handling as a pseudo archiving of the talk page where all edits incl the 4 th last had been removed and the talk page was left blanck and was officialy choosen to dont reply to my first edit who was never adressed meaning its contain and not me as a person
The last edit written by me had been deleeted from the archive and the historic which I didnt accept as I know it was against wiki rules No explainations nor warning were given nor the possibility to contact the admi who had done so as on his talk page he pretended to be on holyday until the end of june wich I found odd as he had done those actions a couple of hours ago
Nobody being there to can talk that matter through with nor any others being named to take over and no plausible explanations being given for doing those hidden reverting of the page I took the initiative to reinteger the last 4 edits in the actual empty talk page as mean to pursue the communication and arrived at a propper reaction regarding the contain of my contribution and not personal attacks against me nor disuasiv terror actions being made against me
I argued about it and explained my actions abundently both before I did it and at the end of those with a clear stand point concerning my worries about the freedom of expression being severely enfringe in wikipedia and the danger of letting this type of actions going on without control as well as seeing wikipedia getting too onesided on a relevant amount of articles

I hope this clarified some point and i didnt appreciate being bulled nor sanctioned by an admi who officially recognised not having read the edits he removed and reverted and archived nor having read my explaination for reinserting some of those from the archive to the talk page and also being warned and threatened and banned from an admi the same who didnt look at all at the contain
