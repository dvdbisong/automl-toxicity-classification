Dear Arkaever what you write makes absolutely no sense  and your spelling of hypothesis with hi at the beginning is the first hint that it is so

Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures while the continental climate has much more brutal variations because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly on the other hand it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil

Thats also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable  and much more important for the global variability of the climate  than effects that occur on the sea They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere At any rate the Milankovitch theory works as settled in Roes paper You shouldnt try to promote your amateurish and scientifically meaningless opinions about difficult subjects on Wikipedia  opinions that as you admit are on par with creationism You simply have neither credentials nor knowledge to do it OK
