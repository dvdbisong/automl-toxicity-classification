Revision in prohibited relations in the Seven Laws 

I noted your partial revert of my changes which I believe did not address the point I was making I am not always that clear In order to avoid editwarring I commented on the talk page instead of rereverting Please respond at your leisure my main point was that it does make sense to refer to specific sexual acts for one prohibited relation when it is not done with the others Thank you
