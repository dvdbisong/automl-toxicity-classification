Im just getting a bit frustrated  In order for a person to analyze whats a good description of the plot and what isnt a person must have seen the series to begin with I dont think I can find anyone else around here that is going to be familiar with this series as it has never been broadcast in the United States  The way to solve an excessive use of FairUse images was to practically use none so I dont know maybe thats the way to solve the episode crisis   0024 3
