I had assumed that the endorsements both had to come from users other than the one who filed the complaint As for needing to do more for the rfc to be considered filed  I used that template they provided what more do they want  Thanks for notifying me of these things  As for this RfC being a good idea  Well the run up to mediation did not change Dicklyons behavior one iota  I also do not think it likely that DarlieB will agree to mediation in the frist place I also have no real faith in mediation for this problem not at this point  I dont think there is a point in engaging in a mediated settlement with Dicklyon  He will just aborogate it when it suits him      

Ill try to get these little formalities right  So far I have read that page and did what I understood I was supposed to do  Perhaps this processs needs simplification
