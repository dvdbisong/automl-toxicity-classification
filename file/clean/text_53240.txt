I appreciate your viewpoint Keithbob While I agree that a rewrite to be more concise is a reasonable future goal I certainly disagree that the revised sections Ive prepared perpetuate any problems they simply dont address and werent designed to address the concerns you raise They are merely intended to correct inaccuracies update figures make language clearer and verify information I strongly object to the notion that the writing style is deeply flawedI am always careful to write in an encyclopedic tone with NPOV in mind Perhaps these new versions are not perfect but I do submit that they are an improvement Even if this more detailed material should eventually be forked I think what I am writing now could be the basis of that fork So Ill hope you reconsider however I will also ask others for their views Best  Talk
