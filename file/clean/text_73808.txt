ReNWOAHM
I have heard it being referenced casually like dark metal and other such genres with LoG as its example I dont think its a real genre coz what i hear is straightaway metalcore I am not really a person who knows much about it though as a I aint american and b not listened to enough metalcore or nwoahm But hey a handful of bands dont make a splash let alone a wave anschaunng
