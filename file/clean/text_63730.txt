Jason Russell 

I am reverting your last edit at Jason Russell under the BLP exemption and per your suggestion I am pursuing resolution at NBLP  Just so you know consensus which doesnt exist in this case anyway does not provide cover for BLP violations  If you put that material back before a decision is reached at the BLP Noticeboard the next stop will be ANI  Of course Im not telling you what to do  merely informing you in advance of my intentions  Stand by for a link to the NBLP discussion which should be available in the next 20 minutes or so  TALK
