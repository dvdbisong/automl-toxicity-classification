This is a nontrivial problem Many perhaps most of the 5000 editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits I can think of two FA writers in that group one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits another spends a lot of time on AWB Any analysis of those 5000 would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types Then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed But most importantly the 5000 accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active 3156 SpielChequers 1248
