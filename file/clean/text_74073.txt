A series of publications has focused on the effects of exposure to low frequency 500 Hz high intensity 90 dB noise a range of structural lung changes having been reported mainly in rats12 but also in humans13 These data suggest that low frequency high intensity noise may lead to structural and functional changes in the airways pleural mesothelium and lung parenchyma With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz it is the lower frequency band of 30150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz14 Furthermore Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that in normal humans the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz In view of these experimental results the most compelling observation in our four patients is that the lower frequency band which tends to be boosted in the kind of music they listen to corresponds with those frequencies thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs
