Never say never  CNTs are very easy to fill with water and organic molecules can provide experimental refs on that The issue is inner diameter not the walls which is usually too small for drugs but this can be tricked by proper CNT growth That said the section was indeed poorly referenced and I just deleted it outright There is much work going on with CNTs for drug delivery and it should be easier just to rewrite the section
