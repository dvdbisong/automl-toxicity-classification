Hirsi Ali Item Misleading

A news item currently reads  Dutch parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali resigns after renewed revelations that she lied on her asylum application  But there were not in fact any new revelations about her asylum application as the lies had been known about for years  The tone seems like antiHirsi Ali POV  I would recommend something more like Dutch parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali resigns amid threats to revoke her citizenship over immigration violations
