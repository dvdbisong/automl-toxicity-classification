Over four hours Guess what I was doing during the four hours between 100am and 500am last night Sleeping Wikipedia is an international website with editors from all over the world not everyone will have an opportunity to respond to a talk page comment at any given moment People work People study People eat And yes people sleep Some people will edit every three hours others will edit every three days You cannot just say that because no one has commented in four hours a discussion is closed Id suggest waiting five to seven days after the conclusion of a conversation before considering it closed 300 film is a very active article and there clearly are a lot of matters that are as of yet unsettled The fact that a talk page has reached a certain size is not an automatic license to archive the page particularly when there is unfinished business Regarding your pending threerevert rule violation all of your reverts to 300 film contribute to the rule unless you are reverting simple vandalism That is not what you are doing you are reverting legitimate edits so clearly consensus has not yet been reached The best course of action is to go to the talk page and discuss the matter more Perhaps you might consider WikipediaMediation Committee or WikipediaMediation Cabal I am not Mardavichs stalking horse Yes he contacted me but that is irrelevant to the fact that you are indeed acting overzealously on the article
