Art Nouveau or Art Deco 

Here is Wikipedia  Beardsley was the most controversial artist of the Art Nouveau era renowned for his dark and perverse images and grotesque erotica which were the main themes of his later work

The images in the Wikipedia entry like those in a hardcover book of Beardsleys work resemble the Art Deco style more than they do that of Art Nouveau

Can anyone shed light upon the matter
