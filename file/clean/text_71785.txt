Pro life
The word fertilization is clearly spelled with a z not an s Also fertilization is conception Theyre the same thing Referring to the unborn as what is just as biased as referring to them as who Also putting quotes around the words right to life when explaining the view of prolifers shows sarcasm as if youre mocking their belief So I dont agree with the reverts from what Ive seen at the beginning Also theres no need to use the words emotive and scientific This violates NPOV and is not needed anyway
