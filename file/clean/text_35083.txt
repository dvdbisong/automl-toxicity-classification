The deleted statement is problematic Most significantly it does not accurately represent the source the passage makes a claim about US chefs like Rick Bayless when in fact the cited pages in the book talk only about Bayless not chefs like him or US chefs in general And then given that the claim is now scoped to just Bayless it becomes a question of undue weight whether or not to include this particular anecdote The book then claims that Bayless spoke of the impossibility of making Mexican food in restaurants which to me indicates that Bayless is speaking from a position of culinary aesthetics rather than a practical evaluation of Mexican cuisine The more I read that section of the book the less impressed I am by the encyclopedic nature of his opinions and statements Regards
