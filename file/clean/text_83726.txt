If a person has right to comment at any page then it does not mean he stars torturing other under the umbrella of policy and legality There is something called Ethics and Conscience to motivate you to be fair And the allegation you are conversely making against me that I visit those users where you visit I only visited those user pages who were participating in the mediation and talk pages related to the article of Muhammad SAW So I happed to see your comments there too But I did not exclusive chase and throw a lame comment at the end of your every post like you did

 Calling you a kid Thats rightly justified because I infered about your mindset so I refered you some video documentaries made by your own American fellows but you simply rejected and alleged that I am trying to convert you If I would like to show you the truth about your religion then I had better videos of comparative religions which I did not refer you just because of the allegations you could make against me but you made allegations anyway
