A welcome and some other things 

Hi Welcome to Wikipedia Hopefully youll enjoy editing around here However there are somethigns that I have to say

First of all when adding your own comment to a discussion be sure that you dont do it in the middle of another persons comment as you did here Second usually one source is enough for a piece of information usually because its sometimes hard to tell from what source that info is obtained from See WPINTEGRITY Third I doubt that Filmflux is a reliable source From the looks of it it seems to be run by a bunch of kids And its a blog usually a big nono here See WPRS Talk
