Kokhra and Kokhar 

Shivraj aside from the page disputes I have a question for you which I believe you have the knowledge to answer I hope you are professional enough to aid this endeavour

I have read that a Suryavanshi clan of Kokhras exist Some Kokhars of Punjab are vehement in their claim that they are Rajputs and some claim to be Jatts We know that Jatts have had dethroned Rajputs in their fold too Is it possible that the Kokhras and Kokhars are one and possibly the same
