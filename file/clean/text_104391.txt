Numbering tables 

The problem with manually numbering lists of bridges is that new bridges are constructed all the time  There are several long bridges that are under constructions that will force a renumbering of the entire list  Your method while a little less confusing takes more work to maintain  Are you willing to take on maintaining the renumbering whenever someone adds a missing bridge  Im not sure it is worth the effort
