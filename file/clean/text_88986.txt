China RO2 is in a state of stasis from Gravity being taken over by gungHo as well as jRO2 shutting down on the 20th of August which ive read from the official site not a word about RO2sea which i would presume are still in negotiations with gungHo as any other regional company seeking license so until kRO2 actually updates and confirms to us they arent just toking off the peace pipe im changing the release dates to TBA
