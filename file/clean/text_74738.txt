I saw your edit the following line that is
0017 6 October 2015 CFred talk  contribs deleted page Signa Vianen A7 Article about a real person which does not credibly indicate the importance or significance of the subject 
I urge you to delete the reference stating that the Article was about a real person which not etc etc 

Are you implying that I lack importance or even significance because a Wiki page did not utterly describe me I did not publish the page about myself and when I saw it years ago I left it at that I only checked if the facts were OK and over the years somebody sometimes helped me to make a few changes But I never bothered about it so much as to expand it by adding all kinds of sources no need 
My relevance is not to be measured by how many articles I published in your country because I was never a journalist in your country In fact you wouldnt even be able to understand anything I wrote because I am not even English speaking You are clearly going by double standards here  When a Wiki editor uses words like crap whenever editing pages about living people credible people with a solid track record that in itself is UNACCEPTABLE And I was not the only one complaining about him
Also please be aware of the FACT that there are a number of pages people with my similar background cultural background that is who have even less data And there is nothing wrong with that because among ourselves we know our importance Nobody from out of nowhere will come in and refer to it as CRAP I was attacked by a stalker yesterday and I called it to Wikis attention because it was one crazy addition to the page The stalker even changed my nationality changing me into a Caribbean national which I am most definitely not I guess that kind of gibberish will prompt the creeps to come out and complete the feast I have come to the conclusion btw that wiki editors are not necessarily the most credible folks since they always hide themselves behind a fake ID  Eraser of Stalker Edits
