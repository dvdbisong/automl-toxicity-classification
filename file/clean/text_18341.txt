Now this is a story all about how my
Life got flipped turned upside down
And Id like to take a minute just sit right there
Ill tell you how I become the prince of a town called BelAir

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool
And all shootin some bball outside of the school
When a couple of guys they were up to no good
Started makin trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in BelAir

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought Nah forget it Yo home to BelAir

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabby yo holmes smell ya later
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of BelAir
