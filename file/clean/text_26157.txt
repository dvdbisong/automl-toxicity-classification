I would just like to point out that we must all strive to be NPOV when editing wikipedia Manboobies removed a reference I had from a fan site which I was unaware was an inappropriate reference and am still investigating about tom sneddon pursuing a personal vendetta against Michael I would say that a similar stance could be taken on this claim that Michael drove the charities into the ground which simply isnt true He tried as hard as he could to keep the Heal the World Foundation running Please just remember that if a section is overly biased apparently it is okay to remove certain references and perhaps similar action could be taken if a user if posting references from heavily biasd websites Just my pitch anyway
