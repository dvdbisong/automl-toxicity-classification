I see that you continue to attack me It is not just my desire that you remain civil and address the facts and not personalities it is Wikipedia Policy and Guidelines that ask that of all posters  including you  I dont answer to you Mr Skolnick nor do I respond to those who cannot remain polite and civil  as you apparently are unable to  Most if not all the questions you raise can be answered by merely reading my previous posts  I will answer any of the points you raise but only to a Mediator an Arbitrator or any of the other posters here that I feel are making an honest effort to move the discussion forward and unfortunately this does not include you
