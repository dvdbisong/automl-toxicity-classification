Apparently you missed the no response is needed above
There was not a drop of pretentiousness in my comment  I didnt start drama drama started when you showed up on my talk page and presumed to instruct me in a brusque and arrogant manner as to what talk pages are foras though I were some noob and you the wise and experienced Wikipedianand what my tone should be like  You are correct above where you say that talk pages are for discussing how to improve the article but I didnt see you telling that to Santamoly  If you jump on anyone who uses a talk page for anything less pure than discussing how to improve the article youre going to be a very busy bee indeed and probably to little effect
I wasnt offended because Santamoly disrespected my religion Voudon isnt my religion I was appalled and disgusted see my original reply to you at herhis provincial and outdated attitude toward a perfectly legitimate religion and made my point firmly  I admitted to you that I could have been less snarky but that wouldnt do
Apparently people only have a proper sense of judgement when they agree with you  Youre not discouraged from pointing out attacks or incivility youre discouraged from doing so in a pompous and arrogant manner which exacerbates rather than resolves  As I said if you had courteously suggested that I was out of line you might have received a thanks for the reminder from me  In fact despite your pompous attitude I was nevertheless receptive enough to offer the concession that some of my remarks could have been better phrased but that wasnt good enough for you no you charged onto my Talk page to slap me down  When I declined to cower you went looking for bigger kids to beat me up only to find that they were disinclined to do so 
Perhaps when youve been around Wikipedia for a while youll have a better grasp of how things happen around here  Or maybe not  Either way if you dont like my attitude youre welcome to stop reading my Talk page any time  Theres clearly no way Im going to get through to you that Im not the only one who was out of line here
