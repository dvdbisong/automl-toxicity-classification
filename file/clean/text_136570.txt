Camp is well known among the creationary group as I should know  The Creationary community is not and has never been homogeneous  There are many different ideas but for the most part they get along great  The ICCs are examples of sharing of ideas and community  There are some recognized offshoot groups like Dr Dino and a couple others that receive criticism  Most of the authors on TrueOrigin come from many ideas in creationism  Most are members of CRS  CRS ICR and AiG and CIM all share basic beliefs and all sell each others books and DVDs etc  There have been some personality conflicts but these mainly have to do with how to proceede rather than in basic beliefs  Creationists consider that people like Dawkins to be pseudoscientific cranks
