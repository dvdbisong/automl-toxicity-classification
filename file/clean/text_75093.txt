Grafitti  Defacement 

I reedited the page to make the section about the graffiti more neutral though now it is probably leaning more the other way I vehemently disagree that the graffiti was defacing anything  The first level was more just crap really but walking up the stairs there were some great paintings and yes paintings i went back a 3rd time with a friend and was crushed when i saw the walls were all white  but on that topic when i was there there were workers in apartment 50 and with my limited russian confidence at the time i got something out of them about a museum but they very well could have just been lying so there wasnt a riot or fed up with people asking them  Has anybody been there recently or since I was in apr 2003  id love to know what has happened to the place whether there is a museum or if there is more horrible graffiti defacing the walls
