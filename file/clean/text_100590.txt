Its been a frustrating set of compromises believe me Ive had people that wanted me to use the website name as the work field and others that thought it the website was a publisher I still believe that the organization that issues the chart in the first place should be treated as the author and I finally removed that field from the citation because there was a very loud campaign from people that just couldnt understand that corporations can legally be treated as people Use of italics was another set of arguments and there was a large segment of people that believed that the chart names themselves were things that we could rewrite to suit our tastes
The work field is the place where I feel the most comfortable making compromises as it is inherently a desriptive field I could compromise by changing the work field to read something like Chartverfolgung SimpsonJessica Irresistible album version at musiclinede and then treating the piece as untitled because they really arent providing a title for the chart pages How would that feel to you
