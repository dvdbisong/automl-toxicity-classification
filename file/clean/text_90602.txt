I said you lied because you wrote Huh clearly discussed in response to the preceding edit summary which was when I wrote that the one before it so 2 edits before yours had no discussion or support You claimed the comments from June 2012 ie the end of the first edit war as this supposed discussion The comments from June 2012 werent justification to change the article to CE then and they most definitely are not justification for changing now As Aoidh and the guidelines have said you need to start a discussion if you want to change it In February 2013 Mzilikazi and his sock puppet did not start a discussion and neither did you or your canvassed friends Aoidh finally started this discussion yesterday 11 months after the start of Mzilikazis second edit war This discussion has led to no conclusions and therefore the status quo must remain at least for now
