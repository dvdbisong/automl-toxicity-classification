I dont know BDD my friend I was probably going through a bad phase of depression which happens sometimes and I am not myself That being said I was caught in some kind of admin war I am not an admin and they happened to pick on me so the usual innocent comments I got warnings and god knows what else about that were as you say just jokes but if I get fought at I fight back I went to edit on IP instead of using my name  to make Wikipedia better of course but didnt want the admin backlash of every edit being scrutinised when it is just boring stuff like spelling errors  unfortunately the provider I use in Hungary there are a lot of sock puppets etc that they have an investigation under WPSOCK and of course I am not one of them Even under IP I signed my talk as SimonTrew under IP But the whole range of addresses has been banned You can tell it is me because I ramble on so much

Best regards to you I took a bit of a break expecting it to cool down in the way it usually does at WP Unfortunately it seems to have warmed up
