Bias  Assume good faith sir 

You have no right to accuse me of showing bias sir as you did here  and here  and you have no evidence for such a claim  I placed a large number of speedy tags on a wide variety of articles based on a sincere belief that they did not meet Wikipedias qualifications  Most of the articles I tagged were about nonnotable bands and people  I have no bias either for or against Scientology or related matters  Please assume good faith in future  Thank you
