Question
Hi Alex regarding this talk page tag which appears on the Transcendental Meditation article

At present it only appears on the talk page of the one main article Would it be proper and useful for me to add it to the talk pages of other articles in the topic area I like to do it but dont know what the protocol is on this I notice that the Abortion topic has it on multiple talk pages any insight you can give is appreciated Thanks     Talk
