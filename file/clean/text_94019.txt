District of Safed 

Hi regarding your edit at Dallata  Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in sometimes even in the article name The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 19458 districts since that is what most modern sources use  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine last section where you will notice that we should be calling them subdistricts rather than districts  Also writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine wont do since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries  Saying that they were in Palestine would be more accurate  It can be confusing but I think Palestine along with the past tense is about the best short solution  What are your thoughts please reply here  talk
