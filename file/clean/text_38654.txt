Hi Sorry I havent been commenting FWIW I have been following up on this but Verno had already covered pretty much everything I did review the ticket and I would have approved it as well Its a shame we cant find some way to make this process more transparent As you probably remember we did talk about something like CommonsCommonsOTRSNoticeboard for Wikipedia but as with so many things itfell through the cracks when something else popped up Im dealing with a migraine today but if I can remember Ill try to draw up a proposal about that later  talk 1507
