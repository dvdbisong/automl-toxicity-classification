Signing comments 

Just because your buttons have gone doesnt mean you cant sign your comments Heres how to do it using the keyboard
If you look at your keyboard you should find a key with a symbol like this on it  If you cant find a key like that just copy the symbol from here
When youre editing just type or paste the symbol in four times 
Theres your signature

Again I would also advise you to look at WikipediaEditing help This shows you how to type the text replacements for the buttons

All the best Μαν

Articles for deletion
Hi  I noticed that youve been participating in the deletion discussions at WPAFD  Thanks we can always use the help  Since AfD isnt a vote but a discussion your recent contributions havent been as helpful as you might hope in addition to a keep or delete some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesnt meet Wikipedias standards is needed  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful  talk  contribs 
hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite  
It isnt really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing  Regardless of what you may think it should be AfD is not a vote and doesnt function as one administrators reading the discussion to determine consensus just disregard any comments that dont include reasons that are based in Wikipedia policy  You are welcome to continue participating in the way you are but it is not a useful way to spend your time since your contributions wont be used to determine whether an article should be deleted or not  talk  contribs  Preceding comment was added at
