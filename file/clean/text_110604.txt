TH1980 mentioned that he did a spot check back during the good article review and I know he has access to almost all of the sources If users interpret the sources in different ways then those can be discussed on a case by case basis However there have been plenty of experienced users who have already done spot checks and found no outstanding problems In this thread though its hard to see what point there is in discussing anything other than the topic of the thread The discussion will become too convoluted to follow I did propose mediation as an alternative to request for comment but currently I have not heard any reason why request for comment is not the best manner to resolve the issue of how to structure the article
