Ethiopian Airlines 

Hello May I ask why you removed the fact that the Somaliland region is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia from the Ethiopian airlines article You do realize that the airline itself like the international community as a whole does not recognize any such country called Somaliland and only includes Somalia in its literature eg here right In fact it doesnt even mention Somaliland on its website 2 So what gives Is there a second Ethiopian Airlines website I should know about Also in your second revert 3 you completely removed the Frequent Flyer Program section that I had just added Whats the point of that too Why not just revert the Somaliland section if that is all you object to Why a wholesale revert Regards Middayexpress talk 

Hi Thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia There is an article in Wikipedia for Somaliland where the readers can get all the information they need including the ones you mention Wikipedia is simply an encyclopedia where neutral points of view should be stated That said it doesnt matter whether the airline or even Ethiopia recognises Somaliland or not the only thing that matters is that it flew once to a destination within its territory Moreover it doesnt matter to which state recognised or not even by the UN Hargeisa is the capital of as to an article concerning any airline not only Ethiopian As already stated in the Airline Project guidelines airline articles as well as pages related to their destinations should only reflect information with neutral points of view Regarding ShebaMiles the frequent flyer programme and its description is properly depicted within the codeshare agreements subsection of the Destinations section where it is also stated that the company has a codesahre agreement with Lufthansa as with many other airlines Scattering information related to the same stuff all through the article renders it disordered Best wishesJetstreamer talk 

Thanks for your response Articles should indeed reflect a neutral point of view However removing clarification of the fact that the city of Hargeisa is internationally recognized as a part of Somalia is not neutral Its actually the opposite of neutral since all of the other images on the Ethiopian Airlines article that show actual Ethiopian Airlines aircraft in various airports around the world all list countrylevel destinations viz United Arab Emirates England Ethiopia They do not list regionallevel destinations only the Hargeisa picture does and thats the point Unless one wants to deliberately give the impression that Somaliland is recognized as country of its own on par with the aforementioned actual nations a clarifying note will have to be added indicating that the Somaliland region is actually internationally regarded as a region of Somalia This is even more necessary considering the fact that Ethiopian Airlines itself doesnt even appear to acknowledge any such subnational let alone national entity it only recognizes Somalia in its literature as shown above please leave a response if any here so that the discussion is all in one place Regards Middayexpress talk 

Do you think the last change I made to Ethiopian Airlines destinations solves the issue Please let me know what you think I added the flag of Somalia so as to appear with that of Somaliland and also modified the caption of the last image Please let me know what you think CheersJetstreamer talk 

That wont do because Somaliland is still listed in the country column alongside actual countries including the Somalia which it is internationally regarded as an autonomous region of It is also the only such disputed territory listed on the table and in such a way That makes the presentation still far from neutral And thats not even mentioning the main Ethiopian Airlines article which still requires a clarificatory note as explained above Middayexpress talk 

Kindly removed Somaliland from the caption of the image in the Ethiopian Airlines article I think were done with that Which is your proposal concerning Ethiopian Airlines destinations Simply removing a terminated destination is clearly not the solutionJetstreamer talk 

Thats one problem solved For the Ethiopian Airlines destinations article I recommend explaining via a footnote that Hargeisa is the capital of Somaliland a selfdeclar
