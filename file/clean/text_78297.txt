Victims of Nat Turner rebellion

I agree  But some would argue the page may not necessarily be racist but yes it certainly is lopsided  I think some brief explanatory introduction of what the rebellion is would be helpful  And if the names of the blacks involved who perished are available then they certainly should be included  Even the names of those insurrectionistsfreedom fighters who later were executed should be included  and perhaps the word victims changed to something less value laden  After all many of these whites and their families thrivedprospered by victimizing exploiting and degrading blacks  They certainly also were victims  And even those insurrectionists who perished because they felt compelled to take matters into their own hands because they couldwould no longer tolerate bondage or the dehumanization of their kin as human chattel  were they no less victims
