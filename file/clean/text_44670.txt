7117432235  Dear HJ do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT articles about Bells antisemitism as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD I  am a simple person the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bells page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views dunderheads  I am sorry but ypur behavior as well as priorymans along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers The facts are the facts Is not the Gray Lady a sufficiently legitimate source
