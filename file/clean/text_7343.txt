Mediation 

Hi Im your friendly cabal mediator here to try and achieve consensus resulting in a better quality article    

My initial surprise is that there seem to be hardly any inline citation for all these claims If people would be so kind as to insert fact tags where they think a part needs citing that would be a good start It would also be great if both sides of the debate could outline below why they object to about the other sides version Please try and keep it as a numbered list this will be useful later on also please try and refrain from commenting in the other users section we can discuss this after the positions are laid out
