Thanks for the explanation  It sort of makes sense  But it looks distinctly odd to delete a link to some information and replace it with a citation needed tag  As regards notability certainly there is no evidence that S2 is notable enough to deserve its own article and indeed it doesnt have a Wikipedia article  But as far as Im aware its not necessary to establish notability separately for each individual fact mentioned in an article
