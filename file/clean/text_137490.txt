I think the best analogy for this kind of copying is our article on Star Wars opening crawl We dont include an actual reprint of the text We include whatever information there is around the text We might even summarize the text but we dont repeat the text not even with a word or two changed Thats how we cover something encyclopedically without getting into copyright issues Admittedly there is some stuff written about the Narnia timeline I dont think its enough to warrant an article and I dont think it justifies copyright violation Im interested to see what a resident copyright expert would say though
