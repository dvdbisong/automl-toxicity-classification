FileVolcano Girls screenshotjpg 

I recieved a note from you stating this pic is up for deletion On the images page the following is given as the reason in the tag 

The name of the song is Volcano Girls and is by the band Veruca Salt As far as I can tell this image is only being used in the songs article and not for the band so Im unsure why the pic can be deleted for this reason Thank you   
I guess I screwed up Ive cancelled the deletion notice
