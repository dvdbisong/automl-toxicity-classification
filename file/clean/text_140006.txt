I can understand your reasons for taking a break As I have been indicating the atmosphere is severe It can have a severe effect on folks unused to such atmosphere I had noticed that you were saying something about infoboxes at the ANI As far as I know there is no set vetting process required for putting up any infoboxes So anyone can put up any infobox they want I dont see much of a value in such infoboxes I like to form my own opinion based on the particular users edits and comments only Looking at the edits and comments of some of the folks who do have infoboxes Actually to my way of thinking there is no need for such infoboxes Things become easily obvious from edits and comments alone I do not say anything about your edits and comments because I think I am unqualified to make an assessment for your contributions I think I have known some fine scholars on WP and have participated in some exhilarating discussions with them But invariable I find their userpages without any infoboxes saying it Why does one need state the obvious Actually I think there are some disadvantages to putting up such infoboxes If you are seriously considering putting up one I think you may want to know my detailed view on it in beforehand Looking at some of your comments I have the most unmistakable impression that you have an excellent grasp of such issues I have known very few users about whom I could say the same I am speaking only about the ones which I have seen As such I was looking forward to other peoples sense of sourcing issues would also improve by having discussions with you I have also been looking for a particular quote from one particular source and I had the impression that you might probably be in a position to help me in that regard It is about some other unrelated article But since you are busy now I dont think it would be proper for me to bother you with some silly request of mine  I have noticed that the catalyst with sidekicks is happy because they have been able to drive you away  Actually it seems to me that they have driven away hundreds of users and also caused blocks on scores of others are experts at harassing others with warnings long winded arguments irrelevant comments severe ad hominem attacks etc etc etc also know how to obtain blocks for their opponents at ANIs Anyway Regards
