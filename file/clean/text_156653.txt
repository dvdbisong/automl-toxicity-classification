Apology
Youre right I got a message from GMaxwell construed it as a threat and got frustrated and let that out through my edit summaries I know I have a temper but thats not an excuse If ive lost you after my inability to control that rage against the feeling of powerlessness that I and so many othersrecently Guanaco has been feeling like this from hearing him in IRC 

I cant think of anything else to say right now If the system can be reformed from the inside I will follow you but I have unfortunately lost faith to any real reforms happening through established channels and im going to be timid in that aspect Ill say more later when im better able but please know that whether your views of me are negative or positive my views of you are mostly positive despite our disagreements afist
