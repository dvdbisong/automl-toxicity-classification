Matrixism vandal 

Hi Youre one of the editors Ive noticed reverting Matrixism linkspamming so I thought you might be interested in voting on WikipediaRedirects_for_deletionApril_25 Matrixism currently redirects to New religious movement and this has been used as a justification for linkspamming in the past I believe an overwhelming vote to delete Matrixism will demonstrate a community consensus against the linkspamming deterring further vandalism Thanks for your help   Welch
