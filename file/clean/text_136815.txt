please explain why I cannot erase a page thats called MY TALK and ask that there be no additions  I just want to be left alone and keep a page clean while a friend is on vacation  I havent talked to anyone and Ive left everyone alone  Why cant I just not have clutter on MY TALK or is it not really MY talk 0245
