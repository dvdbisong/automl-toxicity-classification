Speaking as the person who created this article I have to agree with the first user  I dont see the propriety in keeping the NFL team affiliations  These affiliations are continually subject to change and the article is not updated frequently enough to ensure theres no outdated and incorrect information regarding the team affiliations of former Canes  Besides an interested user can just click on the link to the players page which should accurately state which team if any the player currently plays for  Also please be sure to sign your future contributions to the talk page
