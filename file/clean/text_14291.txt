No Ben you are wrong there The tricolour was the legal flag on NI under the Irish Constitution until a few years ago thus having had some degree of officialdom Much longer than the UB The second largest democratically elected party in NI considers it the flag of NI Clearly it at least merits the same claim to represent NI as the UB It is just such a reaction to the tricolour that leads to an equal and opposite reaction to the UB in my opinion Ever been to a major Ulster GAA match in NI between two NI teams Not a UJ or UB in sight tricolours galore  and all 30000 people there natives of NI  not some foreign country
