I agree with your statements and the reverts I would like to add some different thoughts
I prefer incremental addition of material because it ensures a proper peerreview process Adding 60kb on a single day is just too much to control 
The sudden addition of long paragraphs also raises the question where this material comes from Of course the editor might be extremely gifted and produce an unbelievable amount of information in almost no time But suspicions that the material is copypasted are not too far fetched I think Especially when seeing that the style differs drastically between different section eg the way references are coded I would appreciate if you UserHistorian19 could enlighten us about this question
Another thing I would appreciate are WPedit summaries Thanks  T C
