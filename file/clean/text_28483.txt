Im going to remove the segment stating that Its is widely known in Norway that Dagbladet is supporting the left side of the political system and is not accepable to be neutral on issues regarding USA for a variety of reasons
The text is NPOV
The text is written in rather poor English if anyone want to reinsert it please upgrade the language
Factually what it says is wrong Dagbladet was until 1977 a part of the Liberal Party a centreright or pure centre party Today Dagbladet is arguably radical on certain issues especially regarding culture and moderate on certain other issues It is also the only major newspaper in Norway to be completely politically independent
