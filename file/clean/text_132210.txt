As I am sure you noticed I added a disclaimer that the substitution and deletion was to occur only after consensus had been reached regarding the precise wording  If consensus cannot be reached then the template cannot be substituted and deleted  If you would like to have the decision changed to keep since no consensus can be reached then please feel free to start a thread at WPDRV  I can see both sides of the argument for and against deletion and it wont bother me if my decision is overturned  Thank you for contacting me first and let me know if this sounds like an acceptable resolution  Å’talk
