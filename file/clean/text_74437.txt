Revert of 24 April 2007
I reverted for several reasons  First the text was taken directly from the reference that was added without quotations  Second the reference is really borderline on being a reputable source  Third saying that the 1972 West Valley shutdown had anything to do with President Carters 1977 decision seems like patent nonsense  if its not there should be better sources  Fourth the obvious intent of GNEP is to do the reprocessing overseas  theres never been a ban on that that Im aware of only on reprocessing of civilian spent nuclear fuel inside the US  There may be valid points here get a better source to back up the allegations made  in this one
