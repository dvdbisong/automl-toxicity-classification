It appears I have inadvertently mangled your initial wording sorry I wasam very tired and sick and am not functioning well I have removed the statement it is somewhat redundant and fixed spelling Please add back and reword as you see fit 
I will turn my full attention to this soon hopefully in the most positive and constructive way I am able but not today Peace  1020
