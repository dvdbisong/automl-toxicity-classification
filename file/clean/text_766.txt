Oh hey a response Thats cool I personally feel that having the fortitude to call out TTN on his obvious flaws should warrant a few dozen Barnstars but I see where youre coming from If you insist on keeping the block I would like to formally request the reason for this accounts blocking to be changed to reflect the real reason instead of being noted as a common vandal Maybe a reason along the lines of being a pain in the ass like that one guy on Nakons talk page stated
On that subject maybe he should be blocked too after all he did use a cuss word and thats technically worse than anything Ive ever said
