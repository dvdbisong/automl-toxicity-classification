I agree but the Inland Empire has a hate crime epidemic in recent years and the majority of meth drug labs are in the High Desert Yucca Valley Twentynine Palms The region may develop a bad image as a magnet for hate groups and the rising crime rate gives us a negative name I wish we can talk about something else but its an issue we must address in the Inland Empire and stop gangs drugs or crime before it gets worse The problem hits hard in Palm Springs where a large gaylesbian community lives and Palm Desert with a large population of European Jews who are holocaust survivors Last year nazi gangs targeted a few black families homes in Murrieta by hate mail and property vandalism Theres a FBI statistic on the number of members in hate groups and white supremacists live in the Menifee Valley between Perris and Lake Elsinore Most residents like myself dont like this and oppose their racist ideology so its time for all of us to combat this sort of thing
