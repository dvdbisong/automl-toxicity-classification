Current thinking

One line of thought is that paraphrenia is basically a psychotic illness eg schizophrenia The differences eg preservation of personality
are simply due to the fact that the psychosis starts later and so the persons personality has already formed vs Schizophrenia which often starts
early and therefore disrupts personality development I dont have a specific reference for this but might look for one at some point
