Time Magazine Article  
I was reading the article that was cited   that was used for   I was wondering where does it say that St Johns is amongst the best Catholic Schools  If you read the article it states that  A halfdozen schools besides Notre Dame are outstanding the half dozen are Georgetown Holy Cross Fordham St Loius Boston College and Catholic University  They listed other schools as A number of other Catholic schools fall into the massproduction or goodsmall categories  This is where St Johns was listed  I will correct the statement Time also considered St Johns as one of the best Catholic universities in the nation since the statement is incorrect  2423915358  
I read the article very carefully before adding the information The premise of the article is top Catholic schools and while it does not explicitly say St Johns University is one of the top Catholic schools in the nation it implies that if there were a list St Johns would be on it  247 C 

That is using Original Research  Youre implying what the article is saying  It doesnt say that at all  I dont even believe it is implying that  St Johns is in the section of mass production or good small categories  that is why for a number of schools afterwards they are giving the number of students that each of them have  2423915358  
The title of the article is Best Catholic Colleges its hardly original research  247 C 

I understand what youre saying do you mind if we take this to the St Johns talk page and get a 3rd opinion where an outside individual makes an opinion on it 2423915358  
Sure that would be helpful  247 C
