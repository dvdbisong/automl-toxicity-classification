Hovercontrol 

It seems as though a certain user STILL keeps on being insistant that the link to Hovercontrol be removed from the External Links section This activity has got to stop Its quite odd that the first form of flight ever conceived by man was that of a helicopter Lenoardo Da Vincis conception of manned flight depicted a helicopterlike device Additionally helicopters are a valuable asset to aviation and assist in saving far more lives than fixedwinf aircraft ever can Not only that but the rotorwing segment of Flight Simulation introduced in 1998 when Microsoft forst released a helicopter simulation with the Bell JetRanger in Flight Simulator 98 has exploded and is now one of the most popular components of Flight Simulation in general Hovercontrol is a valued and highly revered website that that has led the way in rotary flight dynamics improvements The days of helicopterrelated flight being the bastardstepchild in Flight Simulator are long over Im not a Hovercontrol website official or an administrator here at Wikipedia but I will keep putting up the Hovercontrol link until this unnecessary BS regarding the Hovercontrol external link stops Its nonsense and its time Hovercontrol earns the respect it deserves  
The IP address you have been reverting has a history of vandalism it seems  I suggest you see if you can get it blocked On a different note please see the discussion above as that would remove Hovercontrol altogether
