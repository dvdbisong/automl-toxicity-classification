Comments on your work as administrator

Now that the dust has cleared a bit I thought it fitting to give you some feedback on the events of a couple of days ago Do you know what a kyosaku is In the zendo when you lose your mind you can request to be struck on the shoulder with a bamboo stick to recover your alertness Even if unrequested I consider the block you imposed on me as a kyosaku a welcome reminder not to let emotions get the better of me After all Wikipedia practice is very much like zen practice You have to drop your ego to write well and if done well the writing itself cuts ego further

Paradoxically however that good effect came out of an action that was not so good It came from an abuse of power by you against me When I am dealing with another user who laces his edits with vulgarities and ad hominem attacks what I expect from the administrators is not onesided vindictive reactions even if for a moment I lose my temper but evenhanded action that restores order and helps everyone maintain the focus on the writing I am disappointed that you were not able to provide that this time around I hope that this has been a learning experience for you as it has been for me and that in the future our interaction will be more constructive than it has been so far
