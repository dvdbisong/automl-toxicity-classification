Why is an article about a Greek Orthodox theological subject being dominated by an Roman Catholic editor
Why is Esoglou making very disproportionate at best Roman Catholic additions to this article 
Why is an article about a Greek philosophy and a Greek Orthodox concept as it is used exclusively in the present being dominated by the editor Esoglou Why are there recent very long additions about people like Augustine whom in their writing never used the word because Augustine could not speak nor read Greek Being added to an article about the very essential difference between Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologies as specifically noted by scholars of Greek Orthodox theology  
Why is Esoglou engaging in rewriting this article to say a concept that is almost exclusive spoken of in Greek
Why to an article about a theological concept so important to Greek Orthodox Theology that is mentioned by Greek Orthodox theologians in that way 
Why is the actual text for the Roman Catholic church now equal to or more that the Eastern Orthodox Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se
Why or what evidence is there to believe outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do
Why is Esoglou using this concepts article to ATTACK Greek theologians John Romanides
Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation Why is it that it appears that Esoglous edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article
Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglous best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church 
Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY
Contrary to what Romanides said it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all even those who choose against him such as the devil 
Why is in Esoglous POV interest to either make the article incoherent discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale
Why if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage it is not clear that Esoglous behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by UserTimothylucasjaeger show 
Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglous anecdotal original research His speculation opinions and interpretations Why is allowed to do this to various wikipedia articles without even once being banned for an hour let alone 24 hours LoveMonkey
