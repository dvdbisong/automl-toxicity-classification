Oh the irony 

Someone commented that I bear a passing resemblance to a character from The Shield Not having ever watched this one I decided to have a look for the character to find out his real name Wikipedia is one of the few sites I can access from work nowadays but imagine the irony of this I still didnt know what he looked like A ridiculous situation but I had to laugh Hope you are well Alf  Bhotep t
