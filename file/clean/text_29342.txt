Two complaints for the prehistoric apex predators section
1 Why is Dunkleosteus listed under dinosaurs that were apex predators Dunkleosteus was a placoderm a fish It was not a dinosaur It should be moved to the section listing other nondinosaurian apex predators Come to think of it why do dinosaurs get their own category instead of being lumped together with the other prehistoric predators some of which were more closely related to dinosaurs than to other creatures on the same list
2 As possibly the largest terrestrial mammalian carnivore in history Andrewsarchus needs to be on this list I know it is thought by some to be a scavenger but so are some of the other creatures on this list such as Tyrannosaurus In fact few prehistoric carnivores have been confirmed one way or the other to be scavengers or active hunters
