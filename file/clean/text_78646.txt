1 Okay
 2 Not entirely sure how to do so but I will read into it At the worst can I just create a new account
 3 No I will not agree to this I find this completely biased and illogical The only point of reference the Actual Student Newspaper The Gauntlet uses is ITSELF You are asking me to go above and beyond what youve previously deemed to be fair This is not fair and I ask that you either remove the Gauntlet page unless you can find  secondary sources as you are asking me or you allow the 2 sentence subsection to stay
