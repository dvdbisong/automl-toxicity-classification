Removed Hoax tag
Im not sure I agree the hoax tag  There is a difference between hoax and popular mythology  The popular mythology of the day is that Kingston created it as day to honor orphans and shutins and that version of events has been widely reported  This should be in the article see WPV verifiability not truth  If there is an alternate version of events that can be sourced ie the Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper article this could be included as well as an alternate sourced version of events  The article space is big enough for both versions without making any judgements as to which is true  Besides the hoax tag is for articles that are primary hoaxes created in Wikipedia without external sourcing  Well known hoaxes that are documented here are just described as such in the article not tagged
