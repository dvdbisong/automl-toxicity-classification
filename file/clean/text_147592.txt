hi netsnipe  thanks for the unblock 

i am not worthy i am not worthy
thanks again netsnipe not really sure why i got blocked my comments on the ref desk discussion page where meant to add to the ongoing debate but i can be too frivolous on the ref desk so i will rein that in pronto
 the sock thing possibly because i use to call my self abe before i learned to log in abe normal was already being used and as perrymankster i use several networked computers and a home pc to log in this could have caused the sock thingy and yes using a spoonerism like perry mankster will have you marked as a naughty boy but it was in ref to tom ken jack and neal rather than trolling i have a fun sense of the world and dont take myself to seriously and of course this might not transfer to well to something like wiki so i will try and be more intune to wiki standards when replying on the desks

wiki has to be the best thing ive ever found on the net and hope it stays as good

thanks again
