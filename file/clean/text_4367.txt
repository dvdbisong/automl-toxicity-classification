Cited academic works that have been vetted by peer review are not POV and are probably some of the hardest forms of source to contradict When I say peer review I mean by those in academia  not our own peer review process Your claims that they are an authors POV are spurious at best The books he used are highly researched publications by noted members of their fields who spent years researching this subject

You will need some serious sources to counter those presented by Chris Also before you go challenging his research I wish to remind you of Chris bona fides he is a published author who is finishing his PhD in Gastronomy from Boston University a major American University You really need to step up if you wish to contradict his work  blah blah
