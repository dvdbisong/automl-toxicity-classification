David Lovelace  why did you mark an article with references as not having them
Please work with me I am not doing this to harass or bother people or to besmirch the good name of Wikipedia We have added further references The Hartford Advocate article is not available online but then lots of Wiki editors use noninternetavailable articles as references every day I am NOT Mr Lovelace and he is NOT paying me to do this I am doing this as a favor to him Why did you mark the article as having no references Is there some preferred format for citations that I am not aware of
