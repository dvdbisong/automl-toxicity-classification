I was a little busy getting my boat up north out of Chicago couldnt decide whether to go to Door County or Mackinaw plus the Stanley Cup took up some of my time Blackhawks won Then you too have been busy  here and here  Anyway as I mentioned I was a little disheartened by your participation  here As a result of your comments made at the AE request I wanted to explain to you that Im truly at a disadvantage at these proceedings The main reason for that is that I find them to be childish and a waste of time There are enough mind games played at the talk pages of some of the articles that we interact at sometimes agreeing sometimes disagreeing that the last last thing I need to do is run to some forum and look for some type of succor to assuage my bruised ego I have a thicker skin than that I do not plan to file this type of complaint now or in the future Which is why Im placed in a disadvantage I simply do not believe in the suppression of free speech free thought or a frank expression of ones beliefs I do draw the line at a bona fide personal attack especially one that is obscene but Ill leave it to you or others to make that call and run to ArbCom when you feel that it is paramount to do so Id be interested in your viewpoint concerning the matter Thanks
