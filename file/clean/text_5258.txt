I have no opinion on  I assume in certain situations it may be of use WRT to the image it was linking to  it looks like it appeared either in The Sun or its website or both and has a  PA Press Association watermark The image is at the Daily Mails website though Now it may not be copyright infringement considering how many other pictures Ive just seen with  PA but it would be better to get it from The Sun if it has to be there at all  talk  contribs  email
