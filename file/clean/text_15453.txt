It is all just terminology 

Perhaps all this argument is about nothing but terminology  Does anyone disagree with any of the following statements  It is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly the players initial pick is random and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat

1 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 3 is between 12 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference This is clearly a conditional probability

2 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 2 is between 12 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference This is clearly a conditional probability

3 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 23 for all host preferences Morgan call this the unconditional case maybe this is where the confusion arises

4 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 23 for all host preferences

5 The probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is 23 for all host preferences

  
Youre right And notice that in case 3 opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition because it is part of the rules of the game The only condition if you would consider the full model there is the initial picking of door 1 In case 4 there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case 5 But  notice that in the MHP a specific door has been chosen and a door opened  

I continue here The difficulty is what we do mean by probability If you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened there is as I mentioned no condition If you mean a door has been opened but I do not know which one and I want to average over all cases concerning the same door the answer depends on the door and is a number between 12 and 1   

I do not quite agree with you  If we average over all cases where a door has been opened but you do not know which one the answer is 23 if we include all possible host strategies in our average  The only way to get an answer other than 23 is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time   

Nijdam do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door  If the player picks randomly the probability of winning is 12  If the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement   
  
Who else agrees   

I agree with 1 and 2  I find 3 4 and 5 somewhat ambiguous without further clarification for example I dont know precisely what you mean by for all host preferences  I would agree with the following revised versions

By for all host preferences I mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to always open door 2 where possible always open door 3 where possible choose randomly where there is a choice or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules   
  
3 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked door 1 is 23

4 The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door is 23

5 The probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is 23

These are clearly unconditional statements that say nothing about the player deciding after the
