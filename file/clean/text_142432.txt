Arbitrary break for my reply
but if we really cant say that with our own experience from watching the show then we should remove the rest of such and such is based off of the character such and such from the original version at least for every character but the main three maybe

Youre totally right with this and I hadnt noticed that this was noted for other characters  For now we should pull it But I think eventually well see reviews and interviews noting the comparisons weve made   But unfortunately per the  original research policy we cant make those statements based on our own observations  Its really frustrating sometime when something is so obvious but it prevents more problems than it causes  Keeping the main three shouldnt be an issue the show runners have talked about the onetoone comparison to their UK counterparts in interviews  Its something Ive been meaning to go looking for the articles where theyve talked about how they are similar and different from the originals but havent had a chance to do yet  This sort of thing is always an issue on list of character articles   they tend to get updated with plot summary and very little else  But as the show progresses there will be more material to drop in so that the article isnt so inuniverse and has more real world info

But would you still remove my edits if I added that information to the casting section

If we can find the links to back up the comparisons absolutely not  I think it will be great info to provide once we have our sources  Its exactly the kind of thhing I mean by real world info casting the roles how they are changed from originals by creators how actors interpret the scenes and characters  

Actually what I gave in my first reply wasnt plot summaries but character summaries 

That was actually a reference to an edit that came after yours  Someone added waaay too much plot detail in there and I was reverting past two peoples edits  Since the lines for our edit summaries are so short I find it hard to be clear about that sometimes  

And while unsourced original research it was from my experience of watching every season and  episode of the UK show so far and doing the same pretty much with the American one I hate things like this where its true but you have a hard time finding something that confirms its true due to Wikipedias standards 

I know exactly what you mean  It drives me bonkers sometimes  I like to drove myself nuts last year looking for this little bit I remembered from an interview about an actor on True Blood  But it really does prevent more problems than it causes  Imagine if every person who had an off the wall interpretation of a scene came in and said well this bit reminded me of this thing in another thing so clearly the other thing was an inspiration  

No need to make this personal But if I really did come across that way Im sorry because I didnt mean to

Not personal at all no worries  I just figured you undid before you saw  my reply to you here  My edit summary probably seemed more blunt than I meant it because again trying to explain the reversion of more than one edit  And I do waaay too much recent changes patrolling which seems to lead to a severe truncating of verbage in edit summaries  I probably seem like a stark raving butthead half the time when Im just trying to be brief  I think you have great instincts about the type of stuff well want to include on the article  We just have to find the articles to back up the info  Theres not going to be a lot out there yet because its the first season but itll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away  I follow the UK versions article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff  So now its particularly overwhelming a thought to try and fix them  The True Blood characters page is my personal nightmare  Ill get around to it

One thing Ive been looking for is an article I read just before the premiere that talked about changes made to the three main characters  I vaguely recall that it had some quotes from the writers and a couple of the actors I think Witwer mentioned something about watching the UK version  I cant seem to dig up the link from the message boards where I read about the show though  Ack
