ALSO  I am completely lost to your logic here where you say If you think that such acts are indeed racist then you are simply a racist WHAT so on ANZAC day or the Holocasut rememberance day if other people were to carry NAZI flags or Japan Emprial flags and I thought that to be racist then by your reasoning then I am racist excuse me did anyone else get that YES I DO NOT like some cultures  namely NAZI racist culture that does not mean I am racist to NAZIs does it I mean that is what Rcnaderlori is suggesting unbeleiveable

I am afraid of a culture where I would be gassed if I were jewish or a culture where I will have my lips cut off for wearing lipstick Iran or a culture where I will be murdered by my father for having a relationship and dishonouring the family etc some things are evil  NAZISM gassing of Jews and Islamic beheadings of Infidels  yes that is truely evil I will not tolerate gas chambers or beheadings never its not that I am afraid It is that nature herself has imprinted on my mind the idea of what is good ie protesting rape and hatred for white people and what is bad gaschambers beheadings and gang rape
