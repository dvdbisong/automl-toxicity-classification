Im not sure what my completely unrelated block has to do with anything Generally speaking it seems to be okay however I have two problems with this proposed version one of which is a legacy of the existing version First of all it removes significant parts from some of the quotes Krugman talking about Armey Maddow specifically stating astroturfing for example Secondly I have no idea what the last paragraph has to do with this section It seems completely unrelated and added as an afterthought
