I figure you were probably monitoring the article and noticed by now but I wanted to let you know that I posted a section about Hamzah in the Syrian Uprising article a day and a half ago or so  When I finished I had a splitting headache and had to log off but I wanted to be sure and let you know  If this does take the situation there to the next level and people there are still demonstrating in his name in a couple of weeks or stage a continuing demonstration as they did in Tahrir Square we can expand it into its own article

The day after I wrote you last I woke to the news that Will Nortons body had been found after six days  The whole week his family had been appealing for any word about him and they kept showing his photo on the news  He had been driving home from school with his father in the car and his mother had taken her own car  They were only a few blocks from home when the Joplin tornado hit  It picked the vehicle up and rolled it several times and his father in the passenger seat had held onto him until his arm was torn from its socket as Will was sucked out of the vehicle through the sunroof

Two hours earlier he had graduated high school
