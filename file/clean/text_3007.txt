Ringmail
I dont know if he regards himself as an expert Ive sweated enough to know for sure that a broigne is not a victorian mistake and to find citable sources for it I understand that the English language world lacks proper history on the subject but from a continental point of view theres no mistake possible that ringmail is different from chainmail and was used in the period between the fall of Rome and the comeback of chainmail in the late 1100s Also the high handed way in which he remade all the article with no regard for the effots of those who came before him and without even setting up an account for people to discuss the matter with him wxas to my view qualification for vandalism

Im quite willing to include the bit about representations making it difficult to differenciate between chainmail and ringmail and the possibility of misconceptions in the 1800s but the basic matter as established with my collaboration stands even if it has to be edited further
