The LVRR 

You began the page by noting A lot of information is not available on the topic of the Lehigh Valley RailRoad However we already do have an article about it with lots of info at its proper name Lehigh Valley Railroad so I converted your new page into a redirect to that existing page which already does mention the nickname Black Diamond Feel free to add to the existing page whatever other info you find
