Distinguishing between professional and unprofessional reviews 

I am currently working on making my article ready for submission I had it reviewed to find out what I would need in order to make this page worthy of wikipedia You reviewed it and mentioned that I would need to find and cite outside sources about the game that were not made for or by the game producers and I would just like some help with looking for these sources How would I distinguish between a prosessional review and an unprofessional one I think this would help me out a lot in finding the sources to cite Thanks again for your time snd I look forward to your input
