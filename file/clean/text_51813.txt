I really need the liner notes of Everything in Time Theres so little information out there Frankly I dont have a clue where songs like New Friend are from Im reluctant to buy the album solely for the notes I might trawl charity shops or something

As for Live my first header would be Background and Production you could do a really long section on TK its success and its singles Then talk about the tour sources at TK Put critical reception below tracklisting per all the other articles and cite the extras using sources already at TK Oh and the track listing would be better in a table like the one at TK Ill look for more reviews for you   Talk Contributions
