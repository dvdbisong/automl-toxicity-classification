TNA said he is the first champion of the TNA era in one of the commericals for Slammiversary when talking about the past 5 years Not quite as saying the first champion in TNA I just think that listing NWA Champions on the TNA Title page could be confusing especially with men that win both Christian Cage for example would have a 2 next to his last NWA Title reign and then a 1 next to his first TNA Title reign
