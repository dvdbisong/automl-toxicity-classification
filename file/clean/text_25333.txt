The two pictures of the Dutch athletes are there simply because they are the best free images we have of individual athletes that clearly depict the medals If you have a suitable free image of a single Chinese athlete that displays the gold or silver medals in a similar way then id be quite happy to let you change it The image at the top of the page has no issue though and is a far more neutral than the one you are proposing Chinese athletes may have won most golds but USA won most medals in total and 87 different nations won at least one medal It is not about recognising any nations achievement but depicting the appearance of the medals in the manner most aceptable to all  TC
