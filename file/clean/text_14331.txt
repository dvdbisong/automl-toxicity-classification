SVG Request 

Hello again Tim I was wondering if you had time if you would be interested in converting some logos from some of the big transport companies of Australia into SVG format At present I only see three that need attention
FileBrambleslogogif
FileLinfoxbrandpng
FileToll Logopng
Also the logo of one of the big political parties over here looks like a good candidate for an SVG conversion FileAustGreenspng If youre busy or anything there is no urgency Thanks again for your time Cheers  talk
