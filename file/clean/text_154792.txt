Oxford Meetup 6 

 Im sorry that you were unable to attend the fifth Oxford Meetup I intended to send this message on Monday but Ive been a bit busy sorry

Several of us would like to continue with the monthly plan since trying to make a twomonthly cycle fit into the University terms doesnt work very well It does occur to me that first Sunday is 7 July which would clash with Coventry 8 Perhaps one of them could be second Sunday 14 July which probably clashes with London 71 for which no date has yet been set but there were reports at Oxford  I think from   that the London attendances are down A page has been created about the sixth Oxford Meetup please sign up if you think that you are able to attend  if the date or venue are unsuitable please comment at its discussion page

Please spread the word to anybody else who you think might be interested The next UK meetups are at London 16 June Manchester 22 June and Coventry 7 July
