The link you put forward as an argument httpwwwwebstersonlinedictionaryorgdefinitionSerbian is citing Wikipedia as its source We are discussing the accuracy of the Wikipedia article you have created a circle That is like saying I am right because I am right It doesnt prove anything Miroslav Radman a Croat is a member of the French Academy of Sciences does that make him French I also do not want to start a nationalist argument with you so let us stay focused on facts I will not revert the article until we sort things out I agree with you that Andric was both a Croatian and a Serbian writer but the issue here is his ethnicity because the article is about the Serbian nation If you would write a novel in German that would make you a German writer but not a German by ethnicity even if you would be a German nationalist You can not choose your ethnicity just like you can not choose your race it is something you are born with People can be of mixed ethnicity but that is not the case here you can not have two nationalities at one time Btw thank you for trying to improve my work on Wikipedia I will read the tips as soon as I can
