Clarification needed  Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article under Brothers shooting later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road trying to get into the vehicle

Does the above have anything to do with this  It doesnt seem so to me  Heres a snippet of the article

Carrying a shotgun by her side a 21yearold Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront where she began searching for car keys Coming down from the second floor she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate  Her gun hit me in the chest Pettigrew 45 recalled from his Quincy apartment I yelled What are you doing and she screamed at me to put my hands up So I put my hands up

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion that she accidentally killed her brother and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brothers death The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrews account of the events today  Only minutes after that shooting according to Pettigrew Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs

So my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle  In other words whats the time line  Thanks
