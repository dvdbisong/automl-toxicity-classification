The rest of the Western world would agree that tests questions and answers ought to be leaked  Really  This entire argument is about only one specific type of information test answers and questions  Notrhing else  To mislabel your posting of cheat sheets of test questions and answers as scientific discourse is as misleading as it is grandiose Posting these cheat shets as you are doing is not furthering scientific discourse  On the contrary by rendering a test that is used in scientific studies less useful which is what you do when you leak its questions and answers on wikiepedia you are hampering scientific discourse  0129
