The article literally claims  her first article in the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad which is simply untrue She had already published more articles in NRC Handelsblad as well as in other Dutch newspapers

Working as national expert is different than being an employee of the European Commission

Well Mees has published five articles or so in The Financial Times Deutschland one in the English Financial Times and five or so in Foreign Policy plus the ones in Le Monde New York Times et cetera Even the Dutch article for Heleen Mees finds Mees publications in foreign papers worthwhile to mention The article is quite unbalanced if you leave that out while at the same time you trip over all descriptions of Mees views on womens issues
