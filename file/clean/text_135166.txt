Yes you have time to editwar and restore the article to promotional version but not to edit to correct it When corrected by some other editor you claim it not to be perfect and do revert repeatedly I see no good in promotional and unsourced tone and contents based purely on primary source

Editwarring Did I make any edit without leaving an edit summary It is you despite discussing the concerns on here you went on to make revert multiple times Im very much disappointed to see apparently an established editor behaving yes much likely to a WPNOTHERE editor It is you who chooses to revert instead discussing the changes You came here to leave a comment only after making a revert Did you notice it You choose to post a warning template on my talk page instead initiating a discussion on articles talk page You should post a editwarring template yourself on your talk page being honest seeing the page history And If I really am editwarring then I dare you to make a case at ANEWANI 

You did not answer one previous question Have you some conflict of interest with the subject And the headline of the discussion is very much appropriate You see good in promotional contents either unsourced or dependent of primary sources and claim it to be encyclopedic Is it really what you understand of encyclopedic contents In my edit the article has less contents but at least it is encyclopedic what Wikipedia is all about see WPENC I do not care for contents I care of standard And thats what I did when removed promtional unsourced and duly based on primary source contents and you did reinstate the same multiple times 4 times am I required to cite diff links You say An article must inevitably describe its subject It is the purpose of an article NO information present in Wikipedia articles should be based on secondary independent and reliable sources and the same should be written in a neutral tone Wikipedia does not accept original research Maintenance tags are not an excuse to put in unsourced promotional tone into any Wikipedia article Do you understand it I may expand more if you want me to  Lets talk
