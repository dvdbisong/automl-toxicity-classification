I am not a legal expert but trying to put too much detail in the legal section will be difficult since only actual court cases in each jurisdiction will decide whether bitcoin is illegal in that jurisdiction or not For example it is stated above The claim that bitcoin is illegal in Indonesia is based on the warning of the Bank Indonesia which claimed that bitcoin is not a legal medium of exchange in Indonesia Thus bitcoin is legal as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange You can thus legally mine it and legally buy it outside Indonesia and hoard it in the country It is legal as long as you do not use it as a medium of exchange Similarly intricate and complicated legal arguments can most probably be made for all statements regarding the legality of bitcoin in each jurisdiction in the world This article is clearly not the space to get bogged down in these legal matters Perhaps this should be stated as a preamble to this section Obviously referencing newspaper articles about the legality or not of bitcoin in a country may be encyclopedic but may be far from correct in terms of the actual legal status in a jurisdiction Most probably not many courtcases regarding this matter have been decided by now The correct way would be to only allow references to courtcases deciding these legal matters in each jurisdiction
