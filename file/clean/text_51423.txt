Members input needed at WikiProject Womens History 

Hello Im writing to you as your name is listed on the members page for WikiProject Womens History In recent discussions at the project most notably here several members have indicated that the scope of the project may need to be more clearly defined and communicated I have set up a workshop page for this but it obviously needs as wide a participation as possible to achieve genuine consensus and to allow the project to move forward Youll find the workshop here 

If you no longer consider yourself an active member of the project it would help if you could indicate this on the members page This will allow us to better gauge how much peoplepower we actually have   Best wishes
