Bruce Lee flexing his muscles in the 1972 movie Way of the Dragon Frontal shot 

Good day Shawnc I were wondering about the photo you updated Bruce Lee flexing his muscles in the 1972 movie Way of the Dragon Frontal shot I think this is your best work yet this is the picture that truly shows Bruce Lees physique I were wondering if you have the same picture but in a bigger resolution or could you tell me where to get it    Thanks Maikeo
