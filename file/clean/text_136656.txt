I do not have the book here with me at the moment  Is it a Wikipedia requirement to not only provide a book but also page number and chapter number etc  That would put enough burden and responsibility on volunteer contributors to not be able to controbute in a practical way  That would be the kind of detail you would expect from a wellpaid staff such as the major commercial or academic encyclopaedias have and even in their case I dont think they provide page numbers or greater details they just mention the source  At any rate this book is academic authentic and wellrespected  Naturally it is deeply hated by its opponents   2237 7 Feb 2005 UTC
