Yes it was published in 1913 because it was published BEFORE the Federal Reserve Act was signed into law as an explanation of a fractional reserve banking system As I did not say that it was published publicly in 1913 I said it was written as you seem to be nutty about citing things PLEASE cite your sources as to it was written or published in the 1960s Also as you ask a few things of me in my posting I would like to kindly ask you to remove your arrogance and assumptions that you always are right Also you didnt even comment on the subject at hand under the summary of this topic defying what you said in the other post Feel free to reply to this at any time or email me at randomrdgmailcom I will be copying this and reposting it daily to prevent editing 715512230   Sam Gelman
