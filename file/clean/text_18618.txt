Rothwell struggles in vain to withdraw from Wikipedia 

This is somewhat off topic but I was surprised to discover that a person is not allowed to withdraw from Wikipedia or delete the contents of his own talk page Apparently it is cybernetic tar pit

Had I know it was against the rules to erase ones own talk page I never would have talked there since I frequently use it for things like unfinished manuscripts which have embarrassing errors jokes and so on which were never intended to be permanent Anyway for the past day or so I have been trying to erase these comments without success One of the Sysops here Mr Connolley apparently wishes to preserve this page because it includes proof that I have committed an egregious violation of the rules by calling someone childish boorish pig headed and unreasonable and earlier an insufferable ninny The poor fellow was so overcome by grief  consternation he felt compelled to report this outrage to the authorities I might also call him a crybaby or a tattletale but he would die of shock I have done enough damage already I fear he may need longterm therapy

Anyway I was banned for this unspeakable language and Connelley will not even allow me to purge the evidence of my shame I changed my description page and sent a message to Connelley with damning evidence for him to use in place of my talk page I fear he may revert both and delete this message but before he does readers here may be amused by the new text here httpenwikipediaorgwikiUserJedRothwell I quote Schillers warning Mit der Dummheit kaempfen Goetter selbst vergebens Against stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain Maid of Orleans act 3 sc 6 Hence the title of this message

Thickskinned readers here might also enjoy the egregious replacement insult I sent to Connelly

   If you would like a reason to block me or prove that I have violated the rules you need not preserve the talk page Here is another deliberate  intentionally provocative violation of the rules  an oldschool personal insult

You are a loathsome sanctimonious hypocritical ignorant twit If you were in state of uncontrolled combustion I would not take the trouble to extinguish the flames by urinating on them

I hope that is satisfactory

That goes for you too Mr   uh Chihuahua  isnt it Bow wow Ruff Grrrrr    Consider yourself gravely insulted If this were the 18th century you might challenge me to a duel but since I am a craven bounder I would of course run away instead of accepting Believe me I am trying to get away without success so far
