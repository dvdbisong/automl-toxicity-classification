The real problem is the set up for GOT wiki characters  Almost unprecedented TV viewers dont want to be subject to the spoilers from the books  If theres a possibility they will they wont click on the wiki link   So just a plain Jon Snow description doesnt say if its from the book or TV or both    Really you should have two separate descriptions Jon SnowTV series and Jon Snowcharacter in a Song of Ice and Fire series such as exist in long running TV or movies series sometimes when they are not exactly the same as the book series  Jack Ryan is a good example
