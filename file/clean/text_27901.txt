Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

Id like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section I wont try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the life on Mars page on this very topic He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS I gave up arguing the point with him

However Id like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches The PresentDay Habitability of Mars 2013  Program

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource Please note I did not write this section myself only added a couple of sentences to it

I strongly recommend that it be reinstated
