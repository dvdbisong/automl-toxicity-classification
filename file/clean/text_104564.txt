Oh ALSO whats particularly funny is that on that ANI discussion Gene Poole says that Elonka asked him to look at the edits and that in his opinion the edits are the same as WikGnomerplatz besides it being hypocritical with his and Elonkas known history of sockpuppet use to try to prevail in conflictsvotes the post there is trying to claim that this was something new he came up with based upon evidence In fact it is just the same false accusation he came up with out of nowhere last fall as part of Elonkas failed attempt to become an admin and which directly lead to his sockpuppets being outed When he made the charges at that time they were found by multiple admins to be completely groundless Hes trying to deceive people by presenting the same tired old harassment as something new and to failing to mention that he was the one actually using those tactics  0612
