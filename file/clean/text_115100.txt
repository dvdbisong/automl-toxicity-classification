Indexing by Saddam or by Hussein 

A recent editor has changed the DEFAULTSORT to Saddam Hussein rather than Hussein Saddam with an edit summary that it is based on a comment to index it that way I have not followed this article and may just be behind on recent events But this seems odd to me Of course it may also unbeknownst to me be the standard way of indexing Arabic names  I doubt it however seeing that his sons were named Hussein not Saddam indicating that Hussein is indeed the name to index However before I do any reverting Ill see what everybody says about this Ill also ask the editor in question to comment on this discussion  talk  contribs   count
