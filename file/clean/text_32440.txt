If you raise a general complaint but cannot specifically cite what your objections are then it is difficult to take you seriously  And even if one were to assume your complaints have substance there is no way to address or redress them without your pointing out specific language to which you object  Youre in effect wasting our time  Im still awaiting a substantive response
