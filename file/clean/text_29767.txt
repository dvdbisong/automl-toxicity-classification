Yes Dave  I find your proposed wording an excellent way forward  

I would very much like to see your version in place of the current version  I would also like to hear some ideas on what to do about the misleading name of the document  Do we continue to refer to the DIs document by its misleading name or is there some practical way to deal with that perplexing issue as well
