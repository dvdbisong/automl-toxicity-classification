I am quite shocked that my inquiry was also deleted I have no quarrel with any user nor even a complaint about anything but I do believe strongly in freedom of speech and it feels quite like communism to have one of my first edits summarily removed I wanted to contribute my opinion to the discussion about talk page deletions which was within this talk page for quite some time with a number of contributors discussing it right here It makes no sense to me that then someone moves it away from this talk page Quite concerned about all of this
