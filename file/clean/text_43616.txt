Mr Haider the theory that Pashtuns are an East Iranian people is the most scientific theory about Pashtun origin based on linguistic and anthropological studiesevidences contrary to other theories which are just wild speculations and fantastic fairy tales So please now that Pashtun ethnography has taken proper course dont push it back to speculative histography by making irrational proclaimations that Pashtuns are an old race of its own and that Pashtuns are great This is an encyclopedia article and it should relect the dominent academic view about Pashtun origin instead of folkloric myths 

Further in detail every ethnic group has a distinct culture but on general level different ethnic groups align with each other to form super groups with the same cultural linguistic and ethnic roots There really was a protoIranian language ethnicity and culture Anthropology linguistics and even social structure align Pashtuns with other Iranian people This is a fact that cannot be refuted with mere sermises and conjectures

I further inform the editors that Pashtun population in Karachi was 11 millions according to 1998 census of Pakistan That might have swelled to at most 1314 millions by now I request the editors to exclude the statement like Pashtuns are twice the number of Pashtuns in Afghanistan because first proper population census of Afghanistan are yet to be held and second this statement would unnecessarily propogate the impression that Pashtuns are now well integrated in one state or the other Moreover we already have have Pashtun populations in various countries mentioned in the side bar 

Further I couldnt understand this term Punjabi Pathan Why coin such term in the first place
