Instead of doing whatever it is you want me to do you both can do MY job and fix the episodes up  The last two are in the wrong order  TLC has a tendency to change things around so Ill just send you a message on a regular basis and you fix it  Yes Ill be a pain the butt but thats what you get for listening to another user who did NOT provide a source that Season 4 has ended  You just went by their word and theyve only been contributing for a month and interfering in the Gosselins page for the past week  Hope you have fun I know I will
