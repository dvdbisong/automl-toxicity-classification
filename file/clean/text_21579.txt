Well at least the relevant passages I think most German to English machine translations are ok but one of the passages confused the machine translations because of an idiomatic phrase and the other one was a problem because of complex sentence structure interacting with sarcasm The machine translations mostly supported the wrong interpretations that people wanted to include but the a human fluent translation does not I dont want to go through that again
