Why Didnt You Block TrustTruth and Rfortner

Sir your block of David Tombe is unfair Apparently you didnt read the discussion The dispute was started by a nasty comment from TrustTruth but you didnt block him Then Rfortner was extremely nasty in a remark to Mr Tombe But you unfairly blocked Mr Tombe This indicates to me that he is right in what he says about you editors So unless you block the real offenders I have to assume that you sir are not a fair and honest person Frankly sir I am upset by the way you have treated me here and this is not unusual editors treat users with disrespect as you have Mr Tombe Wikipedia needs reform to create honest and accurate articles I dont see this happening All I see is political correctness and poorly written articles with significant political bias You need to block the real offenders in this controversy not Mr Tombe 71251183186
