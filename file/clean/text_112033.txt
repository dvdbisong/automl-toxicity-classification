Further note I have undone your changes at TemplateUKacademicbiostub You unfortunately tried to create an article in a template which is the wrong way to do it  that particular template is used on lots of articles to show that the information is about a UK academic and can be expanded Your changes meant that for a while every article using the template was displaying your notes about Edith Hall  If you want to create an article about an academic and you think that they are sufficiently notable check the guidance at WikipediaNotability academics then go ahead  but on a new page not in a template Have a look at HelpStarting a new page for more information  Hope all this makes sense Regards Talk
