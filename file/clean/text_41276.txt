Romanization 

Modified Hepburn romanization as described below should be used in all cases excepting those cases where another romanization is determined to be in common usage in reliable sources
Japanese terms should be romanized according to common usage in Englishlanguage reliable sources as indicated by policy including unconventional romanization of titles and names by licensees eg Devil Hunter Yohko and Tenjho Tengesee belowwords used frequently in English such as sumo or judo the official English name for companies and organizations eg Kodansha rather than Kōdansha Doshisha University rather than Dōshisha University or location names eg Tokyo Kyoto Osaka Kobe Kyushu Honshu Hokkaido Ryukyu Islands Bonin Islands Iwo Jima The list of examples given here is not exhaustive Redirects for all likely romanizations should be created to make sure people will be able to find the articles easily regardless of which form they use in their search
To determine if the nonmacronned form is in common usage in Englishlanguage reliable sources a review should be done of all the related reliable sources used for the article as well as any which may not have been specifically used but can still be considered reliable per WPRS This may be redetermined periodically generally no more often than semiannually as usage changes over time and as new additional reliable sources become available If it can not be determined whether the nonmacronned form is in common usage in Englishlanguage reliable sources then the macronned form should be used until such time as it can be determined
If an article uses Englishlanguage reliables source and those sources use a particular form of romanization to name a topic give preference to that romanization in the article title and body text If an article uses only Japaneselanguage reliable sources use the romanization given in them If no romanization is given by the reliable sources used in an article use modified Hepburn romanization In all cases the same romanization should be used for the article title and the body text within that article and within the body text of other articles
Please note that scholarly reliable sources eg encyclopedias academic journals documentaries and textbooks and mainstream media eg newspapers magazines and television reports reliable sources are equally acceptable and neither should be considered more valid than the other However more recent reliable sources should generally be given preference over older reliable sources especially in topics and areas where current understanding may be more complete than older understanding eg in science and technology
