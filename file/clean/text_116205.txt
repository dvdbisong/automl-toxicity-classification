No example of the infamous 25Cheap the Cheap 

Back in the 50s back when I read the magazine on the cover just
after the price was this Cheap

Clearly whoever participated in creating this wikiarticle didnt know that wasnt reading it back then because you just couldnt miss it it stood right out

Clearly before changing anything someones got to verify this with maybe several people of somewhere near my age 67 who read it back then  or maybe simply call the magazine and ask and get them to email you pictures of several issues that showed the cheap thing

I think that even when it went to 50cents it kept that suffix cheap

Maybe when in attendance at some meeting with at least some attendees old enough to have read it in the 50s at question time stand up and ask THE AUDIENCE what if anything on the front cover immediately followed the price

Or act like a beggar on the subway and walk through from car to car LOUDLY asking in each one anyone read MAD Magazine in the 50s or early 60s  Yes
Well Im trying to verify something  what words if anyalways immediately followed the frontcover price

Follow through on this somehow and youll improve the page

I assume that my comment here is NOT the first one to appear here

CHEERS
