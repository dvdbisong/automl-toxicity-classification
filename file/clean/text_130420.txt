Public Image edit or addon 

Ive overlooked some other contemporary musicians that have a more sorted article about the Public Image article The current one is a bit dumped in a way it doesnt sort out her musical background ACTUAL public image etc So I made a previous edit before of sorting it out but was reverted So I was wondering would this be alright to add or consider ANY parts of the edited version to be added to the current public image article Thank You  talkÂ  contribs
