I like the link to The Unbound Bible however I noticed that some of the translations were not showing up Anyone else have any problems with the links I also was curious about a different link for the translations BibleGateway It provides over 50 Bible translations in 35 languages and includes links to download them as pdf text or audio files I thought this might be a more relavent link Let me know what you think   0100 13 April 2008
