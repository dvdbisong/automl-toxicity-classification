Hi Aoystreck thanks for contributing to helping make this article better

 Spelling and grammar notably though and apostrophes   I spell checked the entire article and I think that I corrected all the spelling mistakes and the apostrophes
 Spoliers  Im undecided on what to do for this problem I do agree that saying to much about scenes being filmed is a give away but I think that occasionally mentioning what type of a scene is being filmed should be noted for example mentioning when and where they filmed scenes with what cast members and occasionally mention a notable setup or notable scene being filmed
 Plot summary  Im not sure if you cited this as a problem but think that the plot section has a reasonable amount of information and plot points throughout the development and writing section because both cast and crew released this information to the public domain via interviews statements  etc so I think that it should be mention because if the information wasnt suppose to be known then they wouldnt have stated it

You also said that these three problems are among others If you could could you please cite other problems with this page so that I could fix them
