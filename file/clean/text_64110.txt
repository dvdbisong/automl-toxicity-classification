After your closing of WPRM discussion on Case Closed saying inter alia  seemed to be disputing invalid argements that you mentioned in the closing arguments Please answer himher there  TALKCONTRIBS 

Just a little misunderstanding I think Ive addressed the issue there Thank you for bringing it to my attention  

 List of mycologists 
Thanks for creating the list of mycologists  The only thing that might be missing is the author abbreviation  I have been linking a lot of those lately in the mushroom articles  

I noticed that the botanists have everything set up pretty well  They have a list of botanists with abbreviations and also a template to make it easy to put a box in an article that gives the abbreviation info

I copied it and changed a couple words  Now we have  httpenwikipediaorgwikiTemplateMycologist

I tried it out on Gaston Guzman  

There are still some red links I havent decided if I should reword the template or add the articles that are in red

What do you think

 

I can see the advantage of having author abbreviations included on the list of mycologists and I cant see the harm of a separate  to parallel  although since mycology falls under the ICBN all mycologists are in some sense botanists and many were both particularly in the early days so the links in the template should lead to author citation botany and botanical name We should not expect a separate article on author citation mycology to be created since mycological naming is botanical naming even if the organisms arent plants  

 Melolonthinae 

Thanks for fixing the errors I made in creating Melolonthinae I took a leap creating it since I have zero practical knowledge of the subject Hey this is totally random but I figure you might know a thing or two about biology as a whole Why does Canis lupus familiaris cover everything from a chihuahua to a great dane yet other animals with very minor variations ex Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdnerii Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii are distinct subspecies  Â C T 

The species is normally defined as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding populations the biological species concept which means that if two animals can interbreed to produce fertile offspring they are considered conspecific Subspecies are defined more vaguely as divisions of a species which are not different enough to prevent interbreeding but which have fairly constant differences I dont know what the morphological difference between O m newberrii and O m gairdnerii is but I am sure there is one The unusual situation is Canis lupus familiaris which has been subject to artificial selection and so exhibits much more physical variation than is normal for taxa of such limited genetic isolation I am not sure whether it is really valid to apply scientific names to domestic dogs and the like in the first place although it is widely done perhaps it represents the scientific name of the wild taxon from which the domesticated breeds are derived By contrast cultivated plants have their own system of nomenclature separate from the ICBN
