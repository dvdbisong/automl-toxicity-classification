While I appreciate the personal attacks I never the less disagree with your conclusion The 3 ITrelated names you mention 2 in fact I have been unable to find any sort of software or otherwise ITrelated technology named Peru It seems fairly obvious that Java and Apple should link to respectively the land mass and the fruit as those are what most people would immediately relate with those wordsnames
While Im sure Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres is a famous artist in his own right hes hardly comparable to artists like Picasso Da Vinci Goya etc which have achieved a general recognition also outside of art circles If you look at artists like Andy Goldsworthy Sebasti√£o Salgado Ansel Adams youll notice that Goldsworthy and Adams simply goes to a disambiguation page while Salgado is an article on some obscure Brazilian village
If Ingres the artist had been a generally well known personartist I would have agreed with you but as it is its 2 separate interest areas with an equal claim to the article namespace and considering Ingres the rdbms is actually named Ingres while Ingres the artist is only part of the artists name I think it makes more sense to keep it as it is with the disambiguation link at the top of the article pointing to Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres
