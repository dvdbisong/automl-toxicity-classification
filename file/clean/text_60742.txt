i dont see where any of the book references have anything to do with yugos i guess the books may have yugo references in them but if they do that should be so stated exactly or else the refernces to books is POV and unverified and who is this conscensous on the porsche thing who forms the conscensous if i and other people with no real knowledge about programming start an article and wipe out any corrections as your editors have do here do they get to form the conscensous and if you who are an expert on the subject edit it and they roll it back is that okay with you you can not have website claiming to be fact yet that is compiled by people with a Npov with an axe to gring or who repeat rumors affecting peoples lives and livlehoods this is what wiki editors did to John Seigenthaler i am sure you a familiar with that i used to live in san antonio and being an anglo i have a point of view on racism in SA should i pubish an article or edit an article on sa i could prove that it is a problem but i wouldnt do that because i am not a expert on race relations or have a degree in sociology so i dont have a right to pubish that as fact as wiki publishes articles about people and things you can not just let a bunch of people publish what ever they think in a public forum where some people are going to take it as truth because you call your self an encylopedia and wiki articles are blindly republished as truth in othe online content so it is not my legal threats that matter it will be resolved on a much higher level that mine this whole thing is why bill gates doesnt make windows open source wouldnt that make your job so much fun when anyone can change the operating system at any second
