Swing out sister  everything but the girl  

I guess I should play my CDs more often  For a minute there I thought Swing Out Sister was the same as Everything but the Girl

Sad that I rarely see CDs of either group for sale in USCanada

Ive actually got Its Better To Travel and Kaleidoscope World and Acoustic and The Language Of Life by EBTG

I guess theres a lot of Smooth or newfusion jazz CDs that we just dont get to see here in USCanada
