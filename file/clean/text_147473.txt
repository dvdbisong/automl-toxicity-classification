The Russian imperialism is rather on the fringe of the mainstream views within RU nation

Are you kidding me Irpen Or the readers of my talkpage I want everyone going to tell fairytales here to make a respective warning in the beginning of his text Even if tales are put down by such a skilled and polite writer as you are  

Its just opposite RU shauvenism is established and encouraged by the state policy of RF both domestic and foreign namely of Putin And since they have no democracy and TV freedom at all while we have very little what may the mainstream view  be if not imperialistic shauvenism While in UA excessive liberalism and ocassionally stupid tolerance is the state policy That was the layout of my POV But It IS NOT a usenet group indeed So Ill try to support my point with balanced editing links and citations 

As for your point Im afraid that your  moderate Ukrainian POV  is amusingly moderate as for me  Best wishes
