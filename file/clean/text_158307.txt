Removed Sun Dried Fetus flavor
I just happened to be browsing the Doritos page and noticed that someone added a flavor called Sun Dried Fetus  At first I thought this was supposed to be Sun Dried Tomato but after visiting the FritoLay website I learned that there is no Sun Dried Tomato flavor so I removed this line completely  Flavor list referenced
