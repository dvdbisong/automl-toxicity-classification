Huh  Have you seen these pages  Look at their titles  At any rate Ive been looking at this wierd saga and it just makes no sense  Has anyone been to this museum  Seen what they call themselves  Visited their website  Read their literature  Spoiler alert  I have  Its more than obvious that The Wild Center is not some sort of nickname or other alternate name for marketing purposes  Its its name  Isnt wikipedia supposed to be an encyclopedia  Isnt it supposed to reflect reality  Cut the nonsense  if you want to accurately describe this museum use its real name  A site that reflects the personal incorrect opinions of a few dictatorial editors is more than a little useless
