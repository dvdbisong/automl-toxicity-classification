More than one version for the Nintendo 

Something to note the US release of Bards Tale has at least 2 different versions  Well call them version 1 and version 2  Its nearly impossible to tell the difference from the outside although I believe version 1 has a darker shade of red for the cover art  The biggest difference is the enemies version 1 uses the same color palette for all the monsters if you get attacked by a group of 3 identical monsters  In version 2 they are given the rainbow treatment each monster appearing a different color  Another difference is the color of the Wizards guarding the wine cellar  All of this is original research but verifiable so I didnt add it to the article
