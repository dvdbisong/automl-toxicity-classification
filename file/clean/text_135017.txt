About Claim of POV and grammar errors for this article

To speedoflight

Your claim of POV and grammar error are not clear and not helpful For instance I cannot see whats wrong with the sentence As a versatile actor Cheung also acted in many comedies With all the different types of roles and movies he acted it is proper to call him a versatile actor In addition all the movies talked in the same paragraph are comedies As the names of movies are already given people can easily check out by either checking the movie itself or going to imdb or any other movie related website Neither is there any grammar error in this short sentence Without this sentence the whole paragraph became confusing and ridiculous In addition I keep telling you that Cheungs niece never explicitly said in his funeral that Cheung was suffered from depression This can be verified by the video record of his funeral published by Cheungs family However you stick on introducing this mistake again and again In addition Ouyang Fengs job in the movie Ashes of Time is killer agent instead of assassin this is easy to verify as the movies name is given in the article I dont know why you change it to the wrong one You also remove the movie link of Happy together I cant see any of these revisions made by you have anything to do with POV or Grammar error

As for the subtitle Golden Age in Film it is just to address the blooming period of Cheungs Film career Changing to Height in career did not show anything about Film If you want to change it to something else at least you should not ruin the meaning I can see that you are very antiChinese media However You should not bring personal feeling in editing I can understand and am tolerant with Chinese media doesnt mean I would trust them In fact I am trying to dig out references not just from news media but also books and original interviews which make the job time consuming

Again its no problem and you are definitely welcome to do editing However you need to be careful not introduce new mistakes in the article In addition please explain you point clear for others to understand and check outAugest 

I keep telling you to be patient as I am still in my process to finger out a better way to put references and resources staff However you keep removing things in all kinds of excuses introducing tons of mistakes and making the article ambiguous If you want to put whatever references you want go ahead and do it Or if anything you consider as needed a reference EXPLICITLY POINTED OUT Dont just rudely remove things with ridiculous reasons Not EVERY piece of sentence needs a reference otherwise ALL articles in wiki should be removed I spent THREE months to verify the information correct errors and finish the current article To dig out all the original resources may need another 3 months I also need break during the Christmas season Please be patient Augest 

Please dont remove background or useful information when you do gramma corrections Augest 

I think its better to put Chinese version of Cheungs suicide note in his Chinese version wiki page to reduce redundancy However I dont have time to do it yet

As for the references I am still trying to think a better way to include them as there are too much about him please be patient Thank you for the suggestions though Augest
