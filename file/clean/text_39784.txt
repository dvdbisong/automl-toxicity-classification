Seating Capacity 

Some of you told me to discuss here and did so but I do not know why you deleted the section I hope that this section will not be deleted this time

I am extremely sure that A340200 has two types of 3class seating configuration The configuration of 261 passengers can fly a shorter range while the configuration of 239 passengers can fly a longer range Before editing I have cited relevant and reliable references but I do not understand why you people still think that my edit is doubtful You know what even the official website of Airbus says my edit is correct

On the other hand some pages of other language on wikipedia can support my edit If other pages say that I am correct then why do you still insist on reverting my changes If the information is different in the same page of different langauges then what is the point of having Wikipeida with so many languages

If you really want to discuss then discuss here and do not remove this paragraph again
