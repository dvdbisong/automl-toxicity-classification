Please see  Yamal Briffa and the Hockey Stick for a parallel discussion In particular Fred Pearce noted that 
The word Yamal turns up in 100 separate emails more than hockey stick or any other totem of the climate wars The emails began with Yamal back in 1996 and they ended with it
 which would seem to qualify Yamal for mention here No mention whatever at present Curious
