Figures in the infobox once again 

I found this

The Russian defeat of Berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the Germans in men 51 guns 151 tanks 51 and planes 31  thats a lot more 2x more men and no German artillery in infobox at all

Until recently the Russians had claimed that they lost 10000 men during the battle for the Seelow Heights and 100000 in Berlin The actual figures are unknown Yet no less than 30000 Red Army soldiers were killed at Seelow and the staggering figure of 600000 killed in Berlin seems more plausible Konev complained at one point that he was losing 1000 men a day because Zhukovs artillery failed to shift fire when asked Zhukov denied that allegation stating that Konev was not using his troops intelligently  now a HOLE DAMN LOT more Wikipedia now claims only 81000 Communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation while even the OLD Soviet figures were appearently more 100000 in the city alone 

Id like to note Battle of the Seelow Heights says 35000 Communist soldiers were killed in this battle which is even more than claimed by these sources

Other source modern Russian The Battle of Berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300000 Soviet casualties The number of German losses is unknown but roughly 480000 were taken prisoner infobox says 134000 captured

Still another However it should be noted that the Soviet Union placed their own casualties as over 300000 in the two weeks of fighting from the Oder to the collapse of Berlin8This number included killed wounded and missing Interestingly recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the Soviets as even higher  Although the exact estimate of Russian casualties during the battle for Berlin is unclear infobox says 81000 killed etc  while everyone knows the Soviet numbers were completely unreliable

How about just not putting any figures as are really just unknown 

Also Britannica about overall Soviet unknown losses

Available estimates of Soviet casualties vary widely A Soviet officer  who served with the high command in Berlin and left the Soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13600000 8500000 dead or missing in battle 2600000 dead in prison camps 2500000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7000000 These figures have been widely accepted in Germany but most US compilations based on Soviet  announcements list 6000000 to 7500000 battle deaths Calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 USSR census give some credence to the higher figures for they seem to indicate losses of from 15000000 to 20000000 males of military age in World War II The figures used here are a compromise estimate not intended to obscure the fact that Soviet casualties are in reality unknown in the West
