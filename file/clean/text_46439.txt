See this First I shall argue that the theory of evolution is by no means religiously or theologically neutral Second I want to ask how we Christians should in fact think about evolution how probable is it all things considered that the Grand Evolutionary Hypothesis is true And third I want to make a remark about how as I see it our intellectuals and academics should serve us the Christian community in this area Note the date before Johnson and the DI took up ID and his statement that Returning to methodological naturalism if indeed natural science is essentially restricted in this way if such a restriction is a part of the very essence of science then what we need here of course is not natural science but a broader inquiry that can include all that we know including the truths that God has created life on earth and could have done it in many different ways Unnatural Science Creation Science Theistic Sciencecall it what you will what we need when we want to know how to think about the origin and development of contemporary life is what is most plausible from a Christian point of view What we need is a scientific account of life that isnt restricted by that methodological naturalism As you may know creation science was relabelled as intelligent design and the statement is very close to Johnsons ideas of theistic realism    talk 1027
