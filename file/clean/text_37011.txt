The actual idea behind timeout is to get the parent to cooloff They are the real problem in a confrontation Its rare that children need to cool off

The theory behind adult timeouts is that you deprive the child of your attention Of course in our electronic gadget society where children hardly ever see their parents anyways that accomplishes nothing So as a replacement for spending time with ones child and paying attention to them most of the time someone invented the child timeout as a form of punishment instead This is not an acceptable tradeoff and thats why child timeouts are bad Theyre still better than physical abuse of course  Ark
