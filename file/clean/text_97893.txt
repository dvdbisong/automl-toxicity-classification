My article httpenwikipediaorgwikiBill_Muster was tagged as an orphan When I read this I wired up about a dozen links from external sites to Wikipedia yet it still says it is an orphan Does it need to have links from within Wikipedia or do links from external sites count Bill Muster grew up as an orphan during the Great Depression in a series of orphanages and foster homes The external links come from billmustercom steamboatscom and other sites
