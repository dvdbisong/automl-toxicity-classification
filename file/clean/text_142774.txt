WM23 Cruft in trivia section taken from archive 

TJ nothing new has been added to that discussion in three days can it just be put back in to the Archive 3 I archive the page cause it was really long if the issue comes up then what would be wrong in starting a new section and pointing out that the discussion is in the archive How about we give it til midnight if no one else has chimed in then move it back to the archive
