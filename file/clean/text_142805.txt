Actually the next station east of PMJ is Lake Hopatcong  Hackettstown is farther down the line on what would be a separate branch of operation for NJ Transit trains to and from the CutOff will not pass Hackettstown  You raise a valid point however  We dont know what NJ Transit will call the CutOff and the extension into PA  Technically it would be correct at least at this point in time to call it an extension of the MontclairBoonton Line  More detail on this would help as would a map
