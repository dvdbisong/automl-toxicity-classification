Hi again I think that when it shows two cross sections is simply an error which may have been made in the original publication as in all cases the crosssections shown are exactly similar to one another It is in the listing for Trochulus hispidus Trochulus striolatus and Humboldtiana nuevoleonis and just now I noticed that the first one with two is Helicella itala Thanks Good wishes
