Bus stop this statement Christian proselytizing shouldnt be pursued on Wikipedia That is exactly what the inclusion of a Jew in the Christian List of converts to Christianity is all about is proof that you are not yourself approaching this discussion in good faith On that basis I very strongly urge you to cease from further comments based on your existing POV as you are completely and utterly failing to assume good faith on the part of any other editor involved in the discussion and clearly using your own point of view as the only relevant matter again without any sources cited yet another rule of wikipedia that I can honestly say that you have demonstrated a disregard for the rules of wikipedia This blatant demonstration of your own lack of objectivity is I think sufficient cause for you to recuse yourself from any further discussion of this matter before you once again cause further action that I believe we would all find regretable
