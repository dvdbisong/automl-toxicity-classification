Do I have to repeat 

1 Karadžić wasis esteemed as an ethnographer reformer of Serbian langauge and culture as well as folklorist

2 Karadžićs work consisted among other things in misappropriation of Croatian cultural heritage 8the balald Hasanaginica first published by Fortis has nothig to do with Serbsor Bosnian Muslims for that matter It is a purely croatian song which VK sold as a Serbian song Also his work in lexicography is unthinkable without Croatian heritagefor instance in his 1847 translation of the New Testament he explicitely stated he had coined ca 300 new words Later investigations httpwwwusergwdgdevbockhovbockhopublikationenhtm have shown that Vuk has simply took more than 90 of his new words from Joakim Stullis Croatian dictionary

3 but its the ideology that matters Starčević had completely unmasked Karadžićs myth on štokaviansSerbs And this part of Karadžićs ideology is what even contemporary Croatian linguists find reprehensible httpwwwmaticahrMH_Periodikavijenac1999135tekstovi08htm httpwwwmaticahrMH_Periodikavijenac1999138tekstovi06htm
