Boolean logic involves the theory of sets And as far as I can see all information all communicated scientific information can fit into either or both of the two categories fact or opinion So when I get information I immediately try to fit it into those 2 category sets But Im human and live with uncertaincies and believe in luck and have hunches etc which are not consistent with Boolean logic And Ive dealt with the mathematics of probability and know that if we went through that formalized process every time we had to make a decision wed never get anything done So as senator Eagleton said about action in the Senate We muddle along But using strict Boolean logic in todays concepts about scientific phenomena wouldnt get us very far It would bog down at the travelling twins paradox But if we took a computer and told it Stick to rigid physical logic and go as far as you can and then call me rather than jumping into hypothetical nonmaterial alternatives we might be able to move the level of real physical entity calculations down into the level of detail that it would need to really explain some of these natural events
