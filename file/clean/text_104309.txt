IntroductionSecond Paragraph
The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national  It doesnt support a broad assertion that as you say The CFS generally referred to legally consists of 3 separate organizations the national CFS a provincial chapter and CFSServices which are often collectively referred to as CFS

Also The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches
Your source does not support that statement Also brand is a corporate term and not NPOV language

Also In addition it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS defacto one organization Is not supported by the one source you provided

See the reliable sources policy Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made  WPRELY

Simon Frasers The Peak has a well established and long time editorial bias against CFS so Im not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source  Again check WPRELY for all the details

This also seems to be directly related to the defederation issues in BC the article you use as evidence seems to speak more to what went on in BC last winter
