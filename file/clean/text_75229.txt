Scientology web links 

It is imperative that we include religiousfreedomwatchorg in this section  Joel Phillips who is a Scientologist is the registered owner for the Church  This site is probably the most important site that the Church owns  It lists every big time critic of Scientology  The site lists all of the facts that the Church believes is true about these people  It lists any crime that they believe the critic of their Church has ever committed  It even has a reward of 5000 against the person who made threats against it  The Scientology website includes articles that show the other side to something they believe is critical to Scientology  They list hate groups as anyone or any group critical of ONLY Scientology  They list religious experts as people that are Scientologists  This site is huge  Its updated all the time and shows up everywhere on all major search engines for every possible search you can imagine  Scientologists should be proud of this website  This website sums up everything that Scientology and the Church are all about  This website is Scientology therefor it should be listed in the Scientology web links section  All in favor say yes  All opposed say no  Thank you
