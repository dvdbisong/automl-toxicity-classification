List of St Louis Rams seasons
It appears that you tried to give List of St Louis Rams seasons a different title by copying its content and pasting either the same content or an edited version of it into another page with a different name This is known as a cutandpaste move and it is undesirable because it splits the page history which is legally required for attribution  Instead the software used by Wikipedia has a feature that allows pages to be moved to a new title together with their edit history In most cases once your account is four days old and has ten edits you should be able to move an article yourself using the Move tab at the top of the page the tab may be hidden in a dropdown menu for you This both preserves the page history intact and automatically creates a redirect from the old title to the new If you cannot perform a particular page move yourself this way eg because a page already exists at the target title please follow the instructions at requested moves to have it moved by someone else
