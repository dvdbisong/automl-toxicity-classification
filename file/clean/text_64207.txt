Re httpsenwikipediaorgwindexphptitleGallipoli_Campaignoldidprevdiff648912759  with this revert you made the comment Image size should not be specified Really Why Is the a wikirule on that you can quote Actually dont bother the image needs to be resized Obviously youre new here and didnt realize that when you make an edit even a revert you are responsible for ensuring that the article has been improved and more importantly not made worse When you make blind reverts like you did here because youre in such a rush to show your wikisuperiority you end up making mistakes  mistakes that others have to both fix again and explain to you Im going to revert it back If you get the revert itch again look at the before and after effects of the edit and stop wasting peoples time
