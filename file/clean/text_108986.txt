Hi  When you uploaded ImageHPUbaseballjpg you did not specify complete source and copyright information  Another user subsequently tagged it with  and for some time it has existed on Wikipedia under the assumption that you created the image and that just as with all of your text contributions you agreed to license it under the GFDL  This assumption however wellmeaning is not legally sufficient and the tag is being phased out  Images using it are being deleted

This image has been tagged for deletion and will be deleted in one week if adequate copyright information is not provided

If you personally are the author of this content meaning that you took the photograph yourself or you created the chart yourself and it does not use any clipart that you did not create please retag the image with a free image copyright tag that correctly describes your licensing intentions usually  or   Please also make sure if you have not already done so that you write a good description of what the image depicts when you took the photo and other important details  This will allow Wikipedia to continue using the image

If you did not create the image or if it is derived from the copyrighted works of others please keep in mind that most images on the internet are copyrighted and are not suitable for use on Wikipedia  Wikipedia respects the copyrights of others and does not use images unless we know that they have been freely licensed  Any creative work is automatically copyrighted even if it lacks a copyright notice  Unless the copyright holder has specifically disclaimed their rights to the image and released it under the GFDL or another compatible license we cannot use it  If you did not create the image simply do nothing and it will be deleted in a week
