TalkIndia 

If you are facing a content dispute you are increasingly unable to resolve I suggest you file an request for comment as was done for TalkHistory of India etc This may help in resolving any disputes you may be facing As for Sarvagnya Ive given him a warning about incivility

In regards to our previous clash I would like to apologize for making rude comments to you  I cant warn Sarvagnya with any credibility if I dont Im obviously not apologizing or defending the blocks Ive issued  I stand by those decisions 101  nor can I appreciate your views on the matter but I do regret being rude to you
