Youve deemed those of us who disagree with the contention that Obama clearly characterized the attacks as an act of terror on September 12 as liars and scam artists  Im trying to keep the article from being turned on its head just because Candy Crowley did a disputed factcheck during a widely televised debate  Why didnt you come to this article on September 13 or anytime prior to the October 16 Presidential debate and have it indicate that Obama clearly characterized the attack as an act of terror if thats true
