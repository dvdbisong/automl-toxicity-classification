Hi Mary Im not going to bother adding anything to the Trance page as that fellow Roux and his minions monitor what I say to silence it before the public gets to read it I suspect this has to do with the somewhat decline in Trance popularity starting in 2008 Last year I would go on this page to write about the trends of Trance and they experienced a backlash as their chosen leader Armin had not lost the polls yet They couldnt believe that the trends could possibly be changing for the next generation in the dance scene They experienced personal feelings of hatred towards me thinking I was a House only propagator In reality I am actually a Trance DJ but dont tell them this as it makes the whole situation even more fun for me That said there is no point in me adding stuff to the page because it will be deleted I am currently writing a very complicated article on dance music if you want to proof read it find a way to provide me with an email address if you want

The history of Trance is very complicated For one thing to put it simply Trance isnt really a genre of music I hate to put it this bluntly and it kind of sounds crazy This is why you cant find information The Snoman section on Trance in his published book is mostly false hopes When people do write about it it is often from the perspective of industry interests who have equity stakes in the genre so they often invent information in attempts to keep the label in the media Most of these clever music terms are the inventions of the English  Sneaky buggers

As Armin puts it it is more A state of trance like his show is titled This observation is correct It doesnt matter what its called as long as its good What he means when he says Trance is a state of mind is that it is not some formulaic equation that determines what is and what isnt All of these labels are just styles and buzzwords You will find difficulty locating written information on Trance because it is just another offshoot of House one of the many The articles that you will find are probably from punters who came out of the Tiesto generation Tiesto is in fact a House DJ but dont tell punters this or they may commit suicide Many have currently experienced heart attacks or early menopause when they found out Tiesto went back to a House sound now Good Luck
