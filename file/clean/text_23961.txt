DAB versus DAB in Ireland

Could somebody explain why if DAB is far superior as this article says would RTÉ begin its DAB service this morning 1 December 2008 httpblogsrnwnlmedianetworkrtetolaunchfivenationaldigitalradioservices rather than a DAB service I accept that RTÉ began its trial versions of DAB in January 2006 ie before DAB was released in February 2007 However if the differences are so significant between both systems why would they have not changed to the newer version by now December 2008 Basically I want to but a DAB type radio with Ipod dock and Im wondering which is the best system to buy now given the above Thanks 192122218190
