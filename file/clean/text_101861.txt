Peace walk
Of course Satish Kumar and his companion used ships to cross the channel and the atlantic something I know all about myself see Pet passport I have changed the article but I think people can figure out for themselves that Satish did not cross water no more than Jesus so please do not vandalise my site 2052 25 Oct 2004 UTC

Wikipedia is no more your site than it is any of ours And that was a valid question  people have walked on water with the help of large flotation skis  2233 25 Oct 2004 UTC

Kumar could not have walked across water in the sixties on Flotation skis because they had not been invented Besides which you could have asked not did they walk on water but did they cross water on flotation skis If they had done so in the sixties across the Atlantic we would all know about it At the very least your comment was absurd and your excuses lame It is not my wiki but I have the right to keep it clean 1341 26 Oct 2004 UTC

 Article Licensing 

Hi Ive  to get users to multilicense all of their contributions that theyve made to either 1 all US state county and city articles or 2 all articles using the Creative Commons AttributionShare Alike  CCbysa v10 and v20 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer  The CCbysa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedias license the GFDL but it allows other projects such as WikiTravel to use our articles  Since you are among the top 2000 Wikipedians by edits I was wondering if you would be willing to multilicense all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles  Over 90 of people asked have agreed  For More Information
MultiLicensing FAQ  Lots of questions answered
MultiLicensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who mulilicense their contributions many users copy and paste the DualLicenseWithCCBySADual template into their user page but there are other options at Template messagesUser namespace  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page

Option 1
I agree to WikipediaMultilicensingmultilicense all my contributions with the exception of my user pages as described below
DualLicenseWithCCBySADual
OR
Option 2
I agree to WikipediaMultilicensingmultilicense all my contributions to any US state county or city article as described below
DualLicenseWithCCBySADual

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain you could replace DualLicenseWithCCBySADual with MultiLicensePD  If you only prefer using the GFDL I would like to know that too  Please let me know what you think at my talk page  Its important to know either way so no one keeps asking    comment talk

Thomas John Barnado
I just wanted to draw your attention to a matter of style We dont usually include a persons titles in the article name  so we have Winston Churchill and not Sir Winston Churchill Therefore we already had an article at Thomas John Barnardo which covers his life and work in some detail What Ive done is made your article Dr Thomas Barnado a redirect so that anyone who goes to it will automatically be sent to the existing one also note the spelling error

All the best with future edits  1526 12 Jan 2005 UTC
