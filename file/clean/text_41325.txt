First I honestly dont care if your different or not  Now that is a lie I have a hard time not being that you are really not DrPizza since your argument starts with another thing as if you were DrPizza sic  You only say you dont care now since its been revealed you were wrong  Its another instance where you shift the argument when youve been proven wrong and engage in a smear campaign  And what do you mean by behind your back  That would mean that he wouldve said idiot somewhere he knows youre not going to look like say the History tab which you dont seem to know about  Presumably someone who bothers to edit the NTFS page would clearly read its associated Talk page  So once again youve failed to provide the evidence and again shift blame and bring up wholly irrelevant issues to cover your tracks  It reminds me of Michael Brown being questioned by Congress  Youve failed to demonstrate you had the correct facts  Youve failed to justify your ideology that wikipedia should only be limited to what you deem mainstream  And youve failed demonstrate any evidence for your ad hominem attacks instead insulting our intelligence by pointing out blaringly obvious facts and insinuating that we are stupid unlike DrPizza your language leaves no room for such doubt and your profile clearly indicates you have no issues with the North American dialect of the English languageOr are you going to backtrack away from your earlier broken argument about language and intention now and casting blame in all directions hoping it sticks somewhere  These are signs of gross immaturity and a complete failure to be able to put forth a rational logical argument  These are your faults not ours  Not DrPizza
