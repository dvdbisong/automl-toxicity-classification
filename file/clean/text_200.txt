Link to Sacramento 

I placed a wikipedialink in this article where the word Sacramento appears  Another editor who appears to be stalking me and is reverting everything that I do claims that I am overlinking by doing this  I have read the policy and think I understand it and I disagree with him  The word Sacramento was not linked anywhere else in this article before I made the link and I think that my link provided good context for a reader who did not know Walnut Creek but thought that maybe they knew Sacramento  Was there anything wrong with my link  I would like someone objective to give their opinions 7423445208
