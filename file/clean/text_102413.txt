If you had bothered to read the talk pages and discuss the proposed edits before you stomped them then you would have probably noticed that I have been discussing the article content extensively across three archived sets of talk pages including this one The problem is that since you and several other editors have demonstrated that you are willing to stomp any edits without discussion which you and several others have done several times now and then complain that the editors are not discussing the edits in the talk pages which is demonstrably NOT TRUE then nobody wants to edit the page anymore Ive consistently indicated my desire to discuss the content and have somebody else edit the page but nobody wants to edit the page anymore because every single minor edit gets stomped without discussion and then we have to endure your complaints and we cant fail to notice your complete lack of content discussion Blah blah blah
