Comment  Its confusing enough that I am not sure what disagree means in this conversation  A quick run through my sources indicates that folk costume folk dress national dress ethnic costume traditonal dress etc are all used pretty much interchangeably  I would support a move to folk costume or folk dress for the reasons cited above but folk costume should not be a subset of national dress since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified at least in Europe  as mentioned some folk dress is still evolving

For what its worth I wouldnt characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress  western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing and bolo ties are a modern invention  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress

By the way the use of narrow use costume to mean theatrical costume is about as common as the use of dress to mean a womans garment with a skirt  Both costume and dress have these narrow nonspecialist everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia  Clothing is probably the most neutral and inclusive term but we struggle in choosing Medieval clothing vs Medieval costume vs Medieval dress  And folk clothing is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb  In the museum and arthistorical worlds costume and dress are both preferred terms

OED definitions are pertinent here 
COSTUME The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress including the way of wearing the hair style of clothing and personal adornment belonging to a particular nation class or period
DRESS Personal attire or apparel orig that proper to some special rank or order of person or to some ceremony or function but in later use often merely Clothing costume garb esp that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering

 is right in that there isnt a simple solution were going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go  Gievn the OED definitions Id say Folk costume is more accurate  But I personally prefer Folk dress and Id choose that over National dress
