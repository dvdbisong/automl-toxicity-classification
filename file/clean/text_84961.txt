In the newish section of the article about naming there is a sentence that states that some Swedish speaking Finns would prefer to be known as svenskspråkiga Finnar I believe that is completely rubbish as use of such a term does not make sense in the Swedish language especially in finlandssvenska as finnefinnar refers specifically to a Finn or Finns who speak Finnish as their mother tongue There is no equivalent distinction in the English language ie the word Finn in English includes all Finns regardless of language the equivalent Swedish would be finländare  I think it should be removed Certainly as one myself I know of no Finland Swede who would call themselves this
