Good Article nomination has failed 
The Good article nomination for  has failed    
Nice article but on readings the TD Judah article nominated at the same time I feel this one has missed something TDJ says that both locomotives were built for companies that couldnt pay for them but this is not mentioned here  In both articles a little bit more about what they were used for would be nice
