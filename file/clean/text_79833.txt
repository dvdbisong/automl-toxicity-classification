I know what you mean but if you split xenogenesis into its two morphemes xeno  genesis then its pretty clear that the word means foreign origin Intermediate level English students are taught the valuable ability of splitting words into their composite affixes in order to discover their meaning In any case if a reader is unable to do so he could look the word up in Wiktionary or somewhere if the entry isnt already in the former Ill add it later today However if another word can be found which does the same job then thats fine too  1704
