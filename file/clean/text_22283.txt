Dear Lightocha your claims of Buddhist origin of Yoga have no grounds Read the article Yoga has Vedic origin

The yoga article used to have much more Buddhist information about 15 months ago but the information was selectively deleted 

Can you please show me which which 15 month version had more Buddhist information As far as my knowledge goes this article has always been Hindu centred which is right as well
