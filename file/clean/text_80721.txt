Ok then But maybe you can imagine how arrived at that conclusion when all of a sudden implicit accusations of sockpuppetry sprang up See also below at disclosure I was planning to have something to that effect on my userpage for quite some time but it never occured to me that anyone could still be interested in old stories like that You see I was never sockpuppeting as in using parallel accounts Block evasion yes sockpuppetry no Any even implicit allegations of the kind I can only judge as badfaith attempts of getting rid of me altogether Find a better reason if youre interested in indefblocking me Or maybe you dont have to My prior blocks on the two shortperiod accounts TfTSE included no warnings or shortterm blocks Indef at once without any warning Where the first block was mostly due to the fact that my total newbie posts and my European IP reminded some folks of someone else who I wasnt And the funny thing is I dont even disagree with those blocks They helped me focus a bit more and get at least some serious contribs under my belt Â Dorftrottel
