Hello and welcome to Wikipedia

I hope that I dont seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome but I noticed your username and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedias username policy for the following reason Your username appears to represent an organization that you are promoting First you shouldnt write articles about yourself or your organization Second usernames must correspond to individuals for legal license reasons so having a username for your group would be against our policies After you look over that policy could we discuss that concern here

Id appreciate learning your views for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern

There are several options available to you
 We can talk about it here 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concerns noted above
 Or if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name then you should visit WikipediaChanging username and follow the instructions there

If we cant resolve this on our own we can ask for help through Wikipedias dispute resolution process such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process
