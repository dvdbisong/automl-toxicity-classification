Cascade Range template inappropriate

Just noticed the notable volcanoes of the Cascades template has been placed here no doubt on Garibaldi as well  I wouldnt have an issue with it if it said notable volcanoes of the Cascade Volcanic Belt or Cascade whateveritis its not the Cascade Range  I havent looked at the edit history to see if you placed this could have been a statesider for all I know but unless the Cascades template is reworded in its titling and doesnt focus on the High Cascades volcanoes its not suitable for a Canadian volcano even Garibaldi which Americans continue to think is in the Cascades as if none of the rest of the Coast Mountains were and it werent on the far side of the Fraser  Dont mean to be snippy Im just very particular about definitions and even more particular about fuzzification of them  Is the template from the Cascade Range bunch or from the WikiProject Mountains do you know  If its the latter Ill take it up with them in the forum thereBTW I found a really amazing couple of shots of the top of Meager maybe its Plinth or Devastator Im not sure google Randall and Kats Flying Photos and tour the first flight the 2006 one to Chilko Lake
