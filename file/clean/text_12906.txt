About Puerto Rican parade day in New York in 2001 where Women were stripped naked by Puerto Rican animals while the police stood by and did nothing Is this something you are proud of Thanks for having served in the Marines but if I came from an ethnic background as unsavory as yours I would be damned if I would brag about it If you want to see Puerto Ricans come up the social scale try convincing them to control their sexual impulses and stop filling our streets with gangs and fat Women who do nothing but collect wellfare and drop little bastards Ethnic groups are not discriminated against because of their ethnicity but because of the way they behave
