I must object quite strongly to your removal of the bolded text from this sentence 
Furthermore intelligent design is neither observable nor repeatable which critics argue violates the scientific requirement of falsifiability

This is an accurate statement in its entirety and does not contain any weasal words I dont understand your purpose in removing the text but Im willing to hear your explanation

I must also object to your edit summary which accused me of trying to trick you and of reverting all your edits To the best of my knowledge we have never interacted before and I have never reverted any of your edits before To claim that I am somehow trying to trick you is nothing short of ludicrous I suggest that an apology is in order in addition to some explanation  Tropics
