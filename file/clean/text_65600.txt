bison hair  

No bigfoot researcher made any big deal of this since the hairs were not yet tested If you have questions on suhc things ask Beckjord who is here The best hair analysis was done by three 
scientists and no further need have been done httpwwwbeckjordcombigfootbloodandhairhtml
Current hair analysis a waste of tiome now imho is done by Dr Henner Fahrenbach

In light of the statements of Dr Michio Kaku CCNY Physics and CUNY saying UFOs may come here
via wormholes an idea I sent him a year ago said it on tv  ABC it would seem that hairy humanoids __could be__ temporary visitors and dna only proves they were humanoid at that time
DNA was obtained by LA state researchers several years back they claim  James Lansdale

Just because a newspaper makes a big deal of possible hairs of BF that later are buffalo does not mean we need to make a big deal Being verified as source does not mean truth Some sources lie
