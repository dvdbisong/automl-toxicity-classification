Tony I note from the block log you are dealing with these users in an apprpriate manner  I apologize for any inappropriate comments or behavior I have made with regard to the Wikipedia in the past  I thank you for cleaning up these folks  Wikimedia Foundation will be granted a perpetual use license to the DSFS file system for internal use on the wikipedia servers for kindly cleaning this up  I will discuss with Bryan and I do not feel he would object to donating full a full use perpetual site license to Wikimedia projects for Wikipedia to use to monitor and control their networks more efficiently  Thank you very much  You have restored my faith in people
