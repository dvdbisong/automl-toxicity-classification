What you cannot do is pretend that the UN itself favours territorial integrity over selfdetermination when the exact opposite is the case The right to selfdetermination is enshrined in the UN Charter but there is no right of annexation to add to the territorial integrity of a state which is what spain relies on As you are well aware Gibraltar as a colony is not a part of ANY other state therefore cannot affect the territorial integrity of a state of which it does not form part The UN itself descibes the right to selfdetermination as a fundamental human right and both the UN and ICJ have repeatedly stated in the process of decolonisation there is no alternative to the principle of selfdetermination It is like comparing chalk with cheeseIt is not me who favours the right to selfdetermination the UN does
