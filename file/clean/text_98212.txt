One More Stab at Making the Article Neutral  
I have inserted a passage that is identical to a passage from the homophobia article It merely replaces the word homosexuality with transexualitytransexualism There is absolutely no reason to keep this passage out  other then to provide the article with a liberally slanted viewpoint It is more difficult to find a citation for opposition to use of the word transphobia than it is to find a citation for opposition to the use of the word homophobia simply because most people dont even know this word exists Common sense however makes it clear that opposition does exist for the same reasons
Depsite changes to the article it still remains nothing but an unsourced opinionated opening section which is then followed by a list of unfortunate incidents Thats not an ecncylopedia article Thats a political pamphlet With this addition I believe that we can at least make the article reasonably neutral in the same way that it seems to have made the homophobia article neutral Im glad that we got rid of that Lewis Ranja guy but he did have a good point
