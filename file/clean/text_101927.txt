Re Patron Saints of Places 

I noticed on the Talk page two separate comments going back a few years that the page would be more userfriendly if the listing was according to Place Accordingly Ive been trying to resort the entries towards that end Ive been making the changes in what I hope are manageable bits partly because its very timeconsuming and I dont want to lose anythingparticularly the citations and partly because Ive been waiting for someone to object I take it from your welcomed feedback that I may proceed
As far as the other patron articles In general since an article on any individual saint would indicate their various areas of patronage geographic and otherwise I think the overall listings would be better grouped by topic However those pages seem somewhat less pressing because at least they are separated alphabetically whereas I found the Places page a bit confusing  particularly because a number of the historical places are now known as something else I am going to see if I can find some images as well unless there is a rule against images and lists
On another note I was looking for a cleanup listing for the Saints portal but the one I found dates back to 31210 Is there a more current one somewhere I noticed your comment on the WTX talk page and I would be interested in helping out a bit on AdventChristmas content if you like  appreciate the input   Mannanan51
