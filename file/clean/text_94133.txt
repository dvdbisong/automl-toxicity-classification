Help with CSS Reference Manual article 

Dear editor this morning I found a new article CSS Reference Manual initiated by another author that I am not acquainted to However while the article was at that point and this moment as well clearly still work in progress another editorcommenter  had put an AfD on it Because I feel a strong need for this new article to exist I defended it strongly with valid arguments even stating that I wanted to contribute to it myself However at the point where ontopic discussions based on argumentation seized to exist the editorcommenter  started to attack me personally by openly questioning my personal credibility
At his talkpage an earlier ban half way of the page is present based on personal attacks although I am not fully sure that he was the one given the ban or that he was the one that gave the ban to someone else

Nevertheless because of this AfD the article gets flamed now by other users that dont take a closer look at it for no valid reason just because its currently labeled as AfD

My question is therefore could you help me out to let this article be enhanced properly to Wikipedia standards
Because I strongly feel that there is a need for it it deserves a decent chance because I would not liketo see very hard work thrown down the drain because of a bully that was banned before for personal attacks and because the articles initial author again not me has done a good job in starting it
