Its not emo 

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo only for someone to delete it Stating that it is completely off topic unproductive unrelated to this article and that belongs in a discussion forum Hello this is a discussion forum for the emo page if we have an issue with something on it its suppose to be displayed here and talked over Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesnt fit to YOUR standards its for people to talk on

With that I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo

First off Id like to take the time to say Read this and dont reply UNLESS you are agreeing or are going to change this matter If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something I dont want to hear it

So here we begin

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez Lead Singer has thought of in that brilliant mind of his Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics Well how else would you explain a painful moment or happy moment in a story A rhyme about whatever the heck junk in a trunk is No youd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself 
Within The Amory Wars page The comic made by Claudio

The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system far in the past known as Heavens Fence in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudios siblings and then murdered themselves by the Supreme TriMage and ruler of Heavens Fence Wilhelm Ryan

All of their songs came from a point in the story if you had known the story youd not tag them as emo at all Because in fact they are not its a story Get over it and stop with all of this scene stuff 

Its all a story unlike other bands that cry and scream about I want to die no one understands me I have it so bad My girlfriend left me because I am whiny

Understand what I am pointing out

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly 
So why not research bands before you label While you are at it read the Coheed and Cambria comics they are quite the epic This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldnt be in this Emo label scene  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

Doesnt matter if they are or arent emo  Theyre listed here as a band that has been called emo  In fact thats the point of the paragraph  to demonstrate how nebulous the term is

If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines  all we have to do is supply a reliable source per WPRS that confirms that CC have been called emo  Source  Thats it  Thats all we need  Any amount of rambling about how they are or arent emo is irrelevant  

And you trust MTV The people that dont even play music anymore pathetic Well I counter your source with mine  Source  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

Did you really read what I wrote  It doesnt matter if theyre emo or not  Were not using CC as an example of an emo band were using CC as an example of a band thats been called emo  Theyve been called emo so theyre mentioned  Period

BTW  click on the tag page of your source  

Honestly I read it But I dont give a damn what you wrote Apparently you are one of those I must be right or heaven shall fall type of people But yet again So youre making your own rules for Wikipedia now You know the public place Cute

But as always there is that one prick in the crowd You know what though KoRn sings about sad matters about how they are lonely and scared little boys and no one gets them Maybe they should be on that list of exmaples Ive heard them be called emo before This is a retort personally I like KoRn With that I am done talking over the matter continue to go on your own about it I wont a
