my opinion
i believe knoledge as such should be neutral any knoledge can be used for good or evil and has therefor no conection to one or another value  you can cualify intention and use of knoledge but not knoledge itself look at the definition of encyclopedia comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge to take out any part of the knoledge would be against the main nature of it to impose a value of evil or even a value of good into knoledge would  remove its natural imparciality and therefor its aproach to the truth 
is the atomic energy bad becouse one can do bombs with it or good becouse one can have energy with it or even then bad becouse one gets terrible wastes from itknoledge should be and will always be NEUTRAL and in my opinion free and to the hand of everyone so that we know weather we do good or evil by our own moral measure and not just becouse we didnt knew
