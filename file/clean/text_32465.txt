Re use of aka for Nou and Oumi I dont know about the view from Ehime but please note that these spellings are common usage in Niigata and beyond Nou is the spelling used on the wiki page the area literature and the train station By leaving these alternatives it will help improve searchability for those using the alternative spellings I dont think there is a case for being so hard and fast Thanks 8 March 1744
