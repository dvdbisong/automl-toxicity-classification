Oppose Plainly contrary to practice and a violation of WPCONSISTENCY Articles which merely list the members of an organization like this with little or no sourced explanatory text about the organization itself are identified as list articles See for example List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame List of National FourString Banjo Hall of Fame members List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame List of Water Skiing Hall of Fame Inductees List of Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees and List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Individual Hall of Fame articles in contrast deal with halls which actually exist as institutions not simply as names given to lifetime achievement awards and whose articles have substantive content about the hall itself beyond the list of members and simple chronological entries The distinction has not been carefully observed but that is no reason to further muddy the waters rather than clarify them Here the is no actual hall as an institution unlike the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown NY the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield MA the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland OH the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame  Museum in Knoxville Iowa the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton IA or even the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward WI Consistency and practice call for retaining the current title and it appears renaming the parallel XRCO Hall of Fame as a list article
