Merging with Mid Sweden University page 

It has been suggested since October 2011 that the page for the Student Union in Sundsvall be merged with the Mid Sweden University I as one of the contributors and a member of the board of the student union in Sundsvall am against such suggestion for following reasons

 Student unions in Sweden are independent organizations and therefore should be treated as independent organizations
 Mid Sweden University has 3 campuses and each campus has its own independent student union While the directing body of the University is the same for 3 campuses the directing body of the student unions in Härnösand Sundsvall and Östersund are different

Thank you
