Albuquerque New Mexico or Dallas Texas 

Im having a problem Even though there is a source saying she was born in Dallas Texas her live facebook video chat on YouTube said otherwise See Demi Lovato Facebook Live Chat Part 1 71609 401 minutes in Demi Lovato confirms that she was born in Albuquerque New Mexico when a fan asked her if shes ever been to Albuquerque via comment So she confirmed she was born in Albuquerque but the source in Early life says she was born in Dallas Which one is it Dont you think we should go with Albuquerque because Lovato confirmed it
