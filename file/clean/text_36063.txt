I really dont care about the few google searches that result one of which is this site If I put in Chelsea or Boys Town halstead st Chicago TONS of hits appear  Not a handful  Gays dont have to wear signs  But there should be more than one drinking establishment that caters to them  The one dike bar on 4th ave is usually pretty dead as is the one on 5th ave  The point is there IS no gay community  A few lesbians does not a community make  But Im not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home  It has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years  The point is the term itself Dyke Slope  I dont like it  Ive never heard it  I dont think its appropriate for Wikipedia  And dont tell me what to do  I can type whatever I feel like on this page

I think you sound like a delusional academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own  Ive never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood  My point is that while they have always been present perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like Dike Slope  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon  It doesnt surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim  But that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years
