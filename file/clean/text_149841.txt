Realworld examples 

If I come across any good analogs in the real world Ill be sure to add them but Ill also be looking out for more experiments in economics not listed on Wikipedia yet  there dont seem to be nearly enough interesting experiments from such a rich field Anyway thanks for your additions they were in line with what I was planning to do 

I think one thing you have to be careful of in Wikipedia is that a claim is totally unsalvageable before deleting it some editors NEVER delete any claim from another user even then One reason is that many Wikipedians love fact s more than their own children and take an accusation of factual error more seriously than aspersions against their parentage Hopefully I dont have as much of a problem as that but its all an interesting experiment in group dynamics

Good luck  0916 2005 May 18 UTC
