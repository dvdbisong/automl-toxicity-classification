Kudzu1  Please have respect and assume good faith Please note that I am not the only editor who has rejected this change see above from User Str1977 User Coffeeshivers You need to have a consensus for a change like this I would like to clarify that I have no problem with a new section being added into the Article where the variuos names historic and colloquial etc for the Sudan could be explored This could absolutely refer to the term North Sudan and it could even specuate about whether North Sudan will become a common name However at the moment not enough time has passed to assess whether Sudan will become commonly known as North Sudan As editors have mentioned  more likely than not it wont become known by that term It would be wrong this single ONE of several colloquial term for the Sudan and include it in the very first sentence Finally you referred to my contributions on the question of the name of South SudanThat is a topic for the other pagebut suffice to say it was not a question of me not liking anything it was a question of what the Constitution of that country says Art 1 8420369183
