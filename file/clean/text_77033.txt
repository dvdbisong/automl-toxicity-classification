 Makedonjiarm√¢njiljii are the ancient macedonians who were romanized and they have their millenary distinguished language They are not Romanian and they are not Greeks by ethnical point of viewIs truth that we have 2 thousands years in commun with the greeks but with Romanians we have nothing before masive imigrantions after the explosion of Moscopole and Gramostea
