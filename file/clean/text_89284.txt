Jorfers complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0999  1   His issue rather is rather the concept of limits actually applies to real life  He is agreeing that the series 09 099 0999  has a limit of 1 but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0999 should be said to be equal to 1 but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount

The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity must be equal  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no nonzero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers  Since 0999 and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity and the only such quanity in the reals is zero 1  0999  0 and thus 1  0999
