Review of this articleinprogress by Erin
Big changes There are NO links to other articles in this article The interconnected nature of Wikipedia is its strength this needs to be changed Your style of writing is too conversational for an informational article Write as if you are the expert 

Little changes Using Wiki markup to force a table of contents at the beginning could add structure to this article This might help you better relate a topic to the next topic youre going to discuss I would also suggest moving the image up to the top of the article so you can immediately communicate visually with the reader

Style suggestions It needs some spell check read it out loud to catch them if your word processor didnt It could also use some grammatical editing to avoid embarrassing apostrophes dropping in wherever they like 

Visual suggestions The figure is wellmade that is it gets across the process of producing a river anticline but it is not properly tagged according to wikis copyright protocols and it could stand some labeling and uploading in a higher resolution

Overall you have a good start Adding links to other articles and presenting the most professional article you can will help you get the rest of the way there Cheers
