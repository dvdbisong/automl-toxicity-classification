The Class action of Greek Cypriots has been on Cyprus dispute article since 28032011 Now after USA Federal Court rejected Greek Cypriots and decided that Greek Cypriots cannot claim that the government in control of Northern Cyprus gave their homes to Turkish CypriotsAlthough the United States does not recognize it as a state the TRNC purportedly operates as a democratic republic with a president prime minister legislature and judiciaryTRNC is not vulnerable to a lawsuit in Washington Hellens immediately removed it from Cyprus dispute page on 15102014 by the 3115394183 I strongly objected this kind of nonneutral stance till now and definitely will object from now on I hope that the number of fair people in WP will increase to take action against this blatant vandalisms
