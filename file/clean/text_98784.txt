Chills Watchmen appearance 

Sorry for editing without asking first I see you fittingly reverted my edit so here I am presenting my point
In the title sequence for the 2009 Watchmen movie the young Nite Owl I is seen punching a mugger that was about to rob a rich couple exiting an Opera House The scene features various theater programs reading Gotham Opera House and several posters reproducing a classic Batman and Robin cover the couple dressed in 30s clothes matches the standard depiction of Thomas and Martha Wayne Alfred is also visible beside them while Bruce is completely missing
I thought this would be worth mentioning in the page  Preceding unsigned comment added by 793048198
