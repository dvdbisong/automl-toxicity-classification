First Ichkeria was recognised by Georgia only during the rule of Gamsakhurdia in the early nineties Second and more important now Chechen insurgents dont control any stable territory and do not maintain a state anywhere Now its rather a government in exile If it were not 2009 but 1998 now Id have nothing against listing Chechnya with other unrecognised countries since then it was indeed de facto independent question
