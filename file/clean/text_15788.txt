Lebanon edits 

Hey there
thank you very much for your edits to the article Lebanon I just wanted to note that you marked all your edits as minor Minor edits should be superficial edits that you are believe will be agreed upon by all editors While I personally agree with all of your edits and think theyve been quite an improvement to the article you should use that minor edit check box a little less often  especially for correcting typographical errors and grammar

I also wanted to take this opportunity to invite you to join  WikiProject Lebanon If youre interested enough in editing Lebanonrelated articles please list yourself as a memeber Thanks again  talk
