Except the film was NEVER announced for release in 2006 so already your agenda is in question  Never  A quick google of Varietycom  a verifiable site not like Aint It Cool which prints rumors lists one and one release date Septemeber 7  And the reviews from that screening that I searched call the film GROUNDBREAKING and one of the best films EVER  They also site the film as being tested in Culver City Ca far away from NYC where you could have seen it  All in all this equals you trolling for unknown purposes
