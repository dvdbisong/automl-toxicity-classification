Disputed paragraph 

While according to the European Patent Register in 2005 85 of European patent applications in the field of electric digital data processing G06F in the International Patent Classification IPC did not give rise to a granted patent but were refused on various grounds or withdrawn by the applicant in response to the search report or substantive objections of the EPO some of them have been granted by the EPO since the 80s At present applications in this field account for 7 of the total number of applications to the EPO but only for about 2 of all granted patents

This paragraph looks like original research to me But even if it werent how is it relevant to the introductory paragraph of this article
