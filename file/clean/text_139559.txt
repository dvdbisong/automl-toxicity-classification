Hi I noticed that you questioned the credibility of my article on Small Town Murder Small town murder is indeed an unsigned band that is certainly not on allmusic but all of the information I have provided is correct and my source is the band itself I hope you are not questioning its worth on wikipedia for it does provide information about a band regardless of how many people want the information 

If you want proof that the information is from the band you may want to view my myspace page and notice the multiple comments back and forth STM and I exchange I am close friends with every member and I used to live with one of them James to be exact You may also see many comments from James on my page If need be I can have them contact someone on wikipedia themselves Please respond to this before you consider deleting my article
