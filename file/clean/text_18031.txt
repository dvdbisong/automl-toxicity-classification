And as I replied there there is no such concept as inherited statistics with respect to the IOC  Medals won by competitors from URS TCH FRG GDR YUG etc in past Games are still recorded as such  Since the IOC does not publish any summary results medal totals that span more than a single Games they dont have to worry about how to combine them  The only instances where an old NOC is replaced with a current NOC is for name changes ie Ceylon to Sri Lanka TaiwanRepublic of China to Chinese Taipei etc  I dont know what you mean by membership rights but the Russian Olympic Committee for example was created in 1989 and recognized in 1993 so clearly is a unique NOC from the Olympic Committee of the USSR   talk  contribs
