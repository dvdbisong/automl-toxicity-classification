Re the deleted photos from Mandy Hall 

I noticed that you do not have email activated here right I really would like to find out how the ORTS permissions in Commons works not just for prophotographer Mandy Hall but for me too Since my earlier message is now buried in your archives this is what she had to say about the five photos she attempted to upload
This is the comment on the deleted photos  Looks like collection of promo photos not own work

I am a professional photographer  I was paid both by Martin Cilia  The Atlantics to take those photos and they requested that they go up onto Wikipedia to replace the outdated ones I own the copyright I guess its kind of flattering that my photos appear too professional to be my own work  Im happy to supply original files with EXIF info if needed Should I put in a request or just leave it for you to handle 
She went on to provide all these ways of contacting her and I do know her well enough she was the first photographer I contacted back in 2007 who was very generous with allowing the Wikipedia to display many of her recent photos She lives in Australia

Will you please help out so we can rectify this situation I use Commons just to upload photos and dont really understand the rest of their work Thank you so much for your kindness in crazy situations like this I may copy this to my less busy talk page if that helps
