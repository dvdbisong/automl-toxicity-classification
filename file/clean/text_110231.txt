Yeah I know it must be shitty having the finger pointed you is Especially on the talk page like that I am not saying it is your fault but something similar did happen You made a quick series of edits that cascaded into edit wars over a few different aspects I honestly dont recall what they were You only did some minor reverting but your edits were the catalyst I actually started a talk page seciton on it title Romacs recent edits or something but deleted it within minutes because Sean or someone else had already started a discussion on it Ill try to find it just so you can see my example Again it was not your fault but these are  potentially similar circumstances
