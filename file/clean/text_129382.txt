I thought we all discussed this that there would be no more mergingIm going to say no for each one because I believe the format we have right now is absolutely perfect And Grantz is hardly a stub more of his back story I can see is coming soon and his freakish zanpakuto may have more abilities then before Kaien should be left alone because he a key character for Rukias history And Mayuri and Ukkitake have a lot of screen time even though Mayuris backstory hasnt been revealed but Ukkitakes has and Grimmjow is now Ichigos nemesis now almost halfdead Im not even going to mention Kira or Matsumoto Ive said what I wanted to say and now about Nells status How long have we seen her 5060chapters After we know the Zanpakuto we should give her an article THIS week Oh why the bloody hell would you vote yes Aizen to be merged Hes the major antagonist for christs sakes

Oh and will people stop saying merge Noitora and Grantz after their run is over Jesus theyve been barely introduced and will play a future role Its crazy saying Oh Ichigos gotten a cool new super power hell kill Noitora and well merge him cuz we know hes going to die Its just speculation Why dont people actually sit back and enjoy the manga not predict deaths which they know arent gonna happenOh and if anyones noticed Szayels article is bigger then Noitoras Theres my two cents No more Merging if you please
