Spam Page Deletion 

Id like to ask you for advice as Im still a junior member Ive been very active on the WikipediaMiscellany for deletion for the past few days as I try to learn about Wikipedia and join new projects often Ive just taken a closer look at your templates and links and I have to admit your work is very impressive You ideas for finding vandalism are very efficient Its great we have people like you here Ive made a brief search using your engine and found hundreds of pages advertising stuff What should I do now In my opinion taking it to the discussion page is totally inefficient as it will take years to discuss all this spam However I guess thats what is done here Should I start putting several spam pages for discussion every day now Should I leave it all alone  but in that case  why do we have those discussions anyway Cant an Admin delete all those pages quickly Thanks in advance and keep up the awesome work
