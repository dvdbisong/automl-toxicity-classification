You were arguably incompetent That you are now claiming cluefulness is likely only because someone Nil Einne has emailed my identity to you Until that was done you were dabbling in something about which you knew nothing merely to make some sort of point about an unrelated discussion elsewhere in which you had failed to get your way You chose to ignore the advice offered by several people of good standing including admins and to push the matter here and elsewhere in a rather idiotic manner I still doubt whether you really understand what has been going on regarding me in part because some of it is sub judice anyway and because the history is long but I guess Ill have to assume that you have in fact now done your homework based on the email that you received
