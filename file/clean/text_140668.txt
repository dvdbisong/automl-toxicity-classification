Original research 

This article seems to be structured on principles of WPOriginal research An indepth analysis of US support to Israel in the absence of mainstream sources that link American military support of Israel to this conflict seems to merely be a tool to somehow make charges of IranianSyrian support seem less problematic Of course those relationships have been a prominent part of the conflict as well as being in contravention to UN SCR 1559 Additionally Hezbollah is a nonstate which is classified to differing degrees by the US UK Canada Australia and the Netherlands as well as having its senior intelligence officer listed by the EU as terrorist I am removing the sections that are not directly related to this Please let me know if you disagree Talk
