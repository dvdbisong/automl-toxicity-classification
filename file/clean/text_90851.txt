First of all Mr Anomymous IP the EU is not a unified entity The EU lacks a unified foreign policy You state that For istance if Usa attack EU the same Usa would disappear for nuclear answer I dont know where to begin This isnt intelligent of even coherent Second you dont seem to realize that the EU is not a single entity that the US could declare war upon Furhermore your scenario of the US and EU going to war is ludicrous Also although the EU as a whole has a slightly larger economy than the United States an essential aspect of a single economy is a unified currency The Eurozone itself has a smaller economy than the United States America and Europe have been joined under NATO as well as steadfast allies In addition though you claim a lot af people claim the US isnt a superpower here at Wikipedia we only use reliable academic sources not POV and original research The next time you spout off your unsubstantiated theories bring solid academic proof of the claimns you make
