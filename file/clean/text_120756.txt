Harry to apply notability to anything just because it exists is rather humancentered dont you think  Notability implies comparison so that one thing is notable over another thing or things  So even my saying that Earth is notable as being the only known safe harbor for life is really poor usage of the word notable  Why is this notable  To whom is it notable  In improving an encyclopedia one must carefully stick to facts as best as one can and one must avoid anthropomorphisms as much as is humanly possible  Â disscuss
