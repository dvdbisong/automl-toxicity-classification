I dont think its a terribly big deal but I think 800x600 seems to be pretty much standard here when it comes to FPSs I just think they dont want really high resolution pics because of bandwidth issues Any image showing combat lighting or a key part of the game would be much appreciated I havnt had a copy of the game in ages 

If you want to put in a mention of the Coop mode feel free There actually wasnt a multiplayer or even gameplay section at all in this article until a month or so ago  I was actually thinking of putting a mods section in as Doom 3 has had a couple of notable ones
