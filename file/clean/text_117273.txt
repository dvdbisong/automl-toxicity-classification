Regarding countenanced vandalism andn personal attacks 
If Wikipedia elects not to block anonymous vandals  AND refuses to delete an entry of which I am the original athor I find it simply beyond belief that Wikepedia could consider me a vandal for deleting the text of an ACTUAL vandal I would suggest you spend your time discussing etiquette with 7059246169

I am not disrupting Wikipedia to make a point I am disrupting what my own entry because it has been repeatedly hijacked by an anonymous editor pursuing a vendetta and making personal attacks
And by the way I know that you can delete Wikipedia pages Its done all the time I know that you can block anonymous editors
