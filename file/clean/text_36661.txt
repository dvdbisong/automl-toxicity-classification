Citation of Patents 
I dont know why the wikipedia citation think creates a link to a site that doesnt have info on the patents I found the patentes easily with Google Patent Search See httpwwwgooglecompatentsid1EVnAAAAEBAJdqHNewhousePatentNo189643 and httpwwwgooglecompatentsid1EVnAAAAEBAJdqHNewhousePatentNo189643 Can anyone help me figure out the proper way to cite these so that it will link to a source that actually contains the info
