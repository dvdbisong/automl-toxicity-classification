Sigh Thats not acceptable Ive given up any idea of unblocking Frightner and will semiprotect the articles involved for a limited time renewed as necessary if the vandalism comes back Please drop me a note or send me an email with diffs if he seems to be vandalizing other articles or user pages and Ill semiprotect those as well Well the user should ask for their own user page to be protected I see yours still are  A shame  squeak
