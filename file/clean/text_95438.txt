Note that the warning was due to the fact that you tried to disambiguate by performing a cut  paste move which separated the article from its contributor history for no good reason A simple use of the movecommand would have served your purpose equally well with less efforts  I have performed a history merge to rejoin the history with the article and created a proper disambiguation page at Water cure
If a similar case ever presents itself please try to avoid copy  pasting entire articles under a new title in favour of using Move as the former may lead to the loss of the contribution history if the original page gets deleted a loss that would constitute a violation of the copyrights of all contributors to the article If in doubt you can also ask for assistance at WPRequested moves
