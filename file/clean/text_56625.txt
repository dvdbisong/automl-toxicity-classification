I vaguely recall a discussion where that was proposed I dont recall committing to anything my response to the proposal or if I responded at all  Can you refresh my memory
I know the vast majority of these nonhamlets do not qualify for CategoryDesignated places in Alberta as defined by Statistics Canada and likely all wont qualify for CategoryFormer municipalities of Alberta I think that category is complete from a former urban municipality persepctive except for a few that dont have articles yet whatsoever  Im opposed to hastily replacing these with CategorySettlements in Alberta as there are multiple definitions for unincorporated nonhamlet settlements in Alberta  Lets discuss unincorporated nonhamlet settlements further once Im done with purging the nonhamlets from CategoryHamlets in Alberta Ill also put refinement of CategoryDesignated places in Alberta on my todo list
