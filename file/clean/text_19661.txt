RandyKitty none of these collaborators did anything I welcome their collaboration Let them add a single line or even delete a line that they think is unimportant Mass deleting is not a collaboration and you are abusing language to make your point I am the only one who collaborated on here Take a look at the record and you shall see I collaborated with at least 4 other editors before 2 collaborators who are collaborators in the sense that the French were collaborators with Hitler simply mass deleted contributions rather than selectively keeping what they liked or approved of Please stop abusing language
