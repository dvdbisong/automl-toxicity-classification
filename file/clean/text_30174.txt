Confusing 

Ummit mentions in the article that to make more effective close range weaponry this was done by shortening the 8 mm Mauser cartridge to 33 mm and using a lighter bullet  last I checked although Im no gun expert 8 mm was shorter than 33 mm  If this is indeed accurate its worded somewhat poorly  new to wikipedia just trying to help JSto
