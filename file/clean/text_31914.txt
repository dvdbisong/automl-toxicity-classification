Alright first off
Please remember to sign all of your posts on talk pages  Typing four tildes after your comment    will insert a signature showing your username and a datetime stamp which is very helpful 
Secondly I understand your point but userpages are about users not for commenting Talk pages were created for this purpose
Now that the warnings are out of the way If you have proof why not post it on the articles talk page Thats what the talk page is for  Post something like I posted insert what you posted here because insert reason here I was reverted because it looked like vandalism The proof it is not vandalism is insert reason here Make sense I thought it did      Got something to say Say it
