Youre right I hope that you can understand that I wanted to let the person frustrating me know how much annoyance his or her actions has caused me Since he or she does not have a personal email posted at his or her page I opted to risk violating the civility protocols I am going to avoid the situationeditor altogether from now on and those like it Perhaps the best approach to deal with these kinds of disputes is to give the other editor the same consideration you would to a psychiatric patient Eg always assume that the silly editor may having a deeply distorted perception of reality and that this is not his or her fault and that I should not take it personally since none of it is intentional on the other editors part Thanks for the message  I honestly did need it Cheers to you too
