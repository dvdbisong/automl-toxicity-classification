Looks like the other thing you dont understand is the nature of the choice
I think you would agree that it would be wrong to treat you the way I might treat a corpse just because if we wait a bit you will become a corpse  After all your potential status is not your current status  When you finally die you will cease to be a person but youre still a person now and we cant just ignore that in the name of farsightedness
In the same way an embryos potential for personhood does not constitute personhood and potential rights are not actual rights so nobody is choosing life or death for a person  When a woman chooses not to become a mother it is the pregnancy that is aborted not a person  The actual rights of an actual person are being recognized as primary over the potential rights of a potential person
Of course if youre really against abortion like I am not just choice the real solution here is to allow comprehensive sexual education and full free access to contraception  Women who dont have an unwanted pregnancy are never in the position to even consider an abortion
