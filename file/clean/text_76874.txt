1 On students and faculty its common to list those who are both only as faculty which is why I deleted Marjustin from the student list and moved Kallas up formal professor and dotsentships As regards Keres and other cases that may come up I think the biography article should then be updated as well and Tartu included

2 I would stay with Academia Gustaviana this is really how it was called and the Charles addition only obscures cf Piirim√§e  Co

3 I would always transliterate Jurjev both in German and in English why did you change it to Yuryev  The point is in almost all literature on the field and especially on the imprints of books that are likely to be read Mattiesen Acta et Commentationes etc it is spelled Jurjev and thus people would look for that  I would if anything put a referral page to Yuryev and Univ of Yuryev
