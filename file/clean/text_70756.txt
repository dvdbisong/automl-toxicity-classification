Third party sources

The article failed the GA review although it was a bit premature in my view and I would have preferred it if the admin who initially indicated that he would review the article had been allowed to have his say 

Anyway one thing that is clear from the review is that there are too many references from the subjects work and that a clutch of thirdparty sources are needed to redress this balance Maybe once that is done steps can begin again to move towards GA status
