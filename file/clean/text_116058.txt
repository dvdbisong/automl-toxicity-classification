I also have no objection anymore to removing the square brackets if it is done entirely consistently throughout the article in the citations however the brackets may still be needed so that the dates are bolded as the 20080909 style is  As one who had to restore all the square brackets which took a lot of time I will not be the editor who removes them  There are square brackets around years in some of the charts created by other editors I just helped to develop the charts following their prevailing format  Please do not alter and thus try to maintain the prevailing citation format it takes forever to code those citations
