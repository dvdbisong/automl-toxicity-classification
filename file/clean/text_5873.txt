Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WPDBAD here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit   as I consider you had pointed me      but that still hasnt given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page here I mean the TalkInternational recognition of Kosovo page As far as the WPRM if this is what you had in mind is concerned my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure Im still not sure that there is one Moreover Im certain that for the time being he doesnt think of another POV of the procedure because of this words of his which are somehow unclear at least to me Any new proposals will be speedy closed Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WPARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of concerning the closure of proposal Im not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo IroK or through the WPRM Actually I find WPRM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new requestproposal is to be made Ive tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WPRM but then I might misunderstood something I might consider asking for explanation on the very own projects page as for that matter Hus as a formalist as I consider you at the moment I must ask you now this when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go throughin order to have any validity I suppose I pointed out  one might consider Ive used irony I apologize to those to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure since the very procedure hasnt been tagged as a guideline but still named a project to the least Maybe some other place exists which Im not aware of  I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner since Ive been passive and not searching for potential one myself Not to mention judgemental and still nonconstructive enough to contribute myself although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action    Sorry for that
Ijanderson977 you asked Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia Well actually I do consider this title is biased also But personally I consider the IroK more globally important not just to me as one might think it is If the bias is dealt with this issue IroK title it could be dealt elsewhere also And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place  maybe creating a new page where this discussion concerning the term recognition or more could be taken should be considered as an idea
All the best s talk
