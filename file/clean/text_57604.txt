Looking at that pages revision history you appear to have edit warred as much as anyone else 
I urge you to reread WPBRD specifically this passage  
BRD is not a valid excuse for reverting goodfaith efforts to improve a page simply because you dont like the changes Dont invoke BRD as your reason for reverting someone elses work or for edit warring instead provide a reason that is based on policies guidelines or common sense  

Examining the talk page where one would expect to find those reasons we see multiple contributions from each of the edit warring editors even IPs  except you You raise exactly one objection Academic Questions  does not appear to be peer reviewed which in fact it is and proof was presented on the talk page Did I miss your response I encourage you to return to the talk page and discuss Page protection should not be used to settle content disputes 104156240153
