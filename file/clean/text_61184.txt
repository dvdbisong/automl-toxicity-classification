1 In Pakistan ethnic Pushtuns who also speak Pashtu language are considered Pushtuns Due like what else can they be considered as other than Pashtuns 2 There are many Pushtun tribes that have settled in different parts of South Asia over generations and have adopted the local languages and culture and thus have became part of that ethnic group Part of that ethnic group What ethnic group you talking about 3 Nearly 45 million  people in United States claiming German ancestory although they are now part of English speaking Americans These people who claim German heritage in USA are not claiming German citizenships or being from Germanythey are simly saying that their ancestors came to USA from Germany and that they are Germans by heirtage 4 They are also not considered Germans since they dont speak German Who are you to say that they are not considered Germans and so what if they dont speak German language There are many people from Asia and other places living in Germany and they all speak German language noware these people Germans by ethnics becayse they speak German language 5 The people who dont speak Pashtun and claiming to have Pashtun ancestory cannot be classified as Pashtuns I think that the Pashtun are ethnic Pushtuns who also speak Pashtu language and may include their first generation children If they and their parents dont speak Pushtun then they are longer ethnic Pashtun though they can claim Pastun ancestry UserSiddiui you are getting confused between Pashto language and Ethnic Pashtuns Anyone can learn to speak Pashtothat alone does not qualify anyone to be Pashtun In fact that means nothing We Pashtuns believe that ONLY THROUGH BLOOD family background a person is recognized as Pashtun UserNisarKand November 7 2006
