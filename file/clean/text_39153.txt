Unclean animals 

I believe that there is a problem with the information regarding exclusions  The way it reads would imply that the pig is an exclusion to the rules set fourth by Jewish law  Absolutly not true  You might even say this is in some way a direct contradiction  Perhaps the original writer used the word exclusion erroneously  If you are unsure of what a word means you obviously should not use it especially in an encyclopedia
