Barnstar
Hi Solipsist first I would like to say thanks very much for your kind comments and observations on my modern art contributions and the gift of the wonderful revolving barnstar It was quite unexpected and made my evening 

Ive noticed your continual contributions tooas have others too judging from your barnstarsand was already wondering whether I could leave one for you when one appeared for me This is my first time for awarding a barnstar and I hope it is acceptable

I would be grateful when you have the time if you could cast your eye over the Damien Hirst article as I would like to bring this up to featured article level I havent got enough experience to know what might need to be done and how far short it would be at the moment Any pointers would be welcome I think it has the potential to make a very notable featured article There is already some very interesting material in there that I had never come across before I started researching for itand I thought I was fairly conversant with the subject
