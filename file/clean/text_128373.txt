SHANES There is no way I bow to the unjustice and comply to that arrogant bastard That guy reverted my edition based on the fact he claimed arrogantly that his version was better than the others Wellyou better tell me if that was a resason good enough ALSO Why didnt he need to start a discussion before he changed the previous article while I am asked everytime to start a discussion to socalled defend my edition Why he wasnt asked to defend his action while I was called to defend my edition This is absolutely ridiculous and obviously there is a double standard This guy changes others edition for the sake of changing it He only knows to mess around and stirs up trouble I am just here to defend  my rights and not let it exploited by some troublemakers By the way I think I have better things to do but the only reason why I come back and persistently reverting it back to the changed version only because there is absolutely no justice I dont want to accuse you but I think your handling is a very onesided and biased
