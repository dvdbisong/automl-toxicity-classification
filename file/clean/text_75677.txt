As per NPOR Selfpublished expert sources may be considered reliable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable thirdparty publications Caution should be exercised when using such sources if the information in question is really worth reporting someone else is likely to have done so Selfpublished sources should never be used as thirdparty sources about living persons even if the author is an expert or wellknown professional researcher or writer

The simple fact that noone has already done so is evidence that either A nobody has noticed or B nobody dares try If such a paper has even been produced by a professional which through my research it hasnt then which journal would publish this information only in the case of A would it be NPOR but to say that nobody has noticed this is utterly absurd It is plain to see even to a child 6425081218
