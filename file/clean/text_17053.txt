Clearly you havent read WPNPA otherwise you wouldnt have written this It is difficult to understand why someone interested in Jeremy Sinden should instead rush across to his far less wellknown brothers article and immediately feel the need to remove tags The tags remain because the article is in severe need of a rewrite not least because one of the main contributors has claimed to be a good friend and a fan of Marc Sinden from the age of 12 when they met on the set of the Hey Jude video recording Unfortunately this is the very same editor that was caught dragging along a bucketload of socks to try and support various POV positions and outright puffery of Marc Sinden and Sindenrelated articles Amazingly enough this editor and their socks have added Marc Sindens name to around 130 articles on Wikipedia 130 For someone whos less notable than my goldfish
Its certainly true that the Jeremy Sinden article might lead one here because of course there are no less than three mentionslinks to Marcus page from there  sadly there is not one single link from Marcus back to Jeremys indeed his name has been expunged completely from the Marc Sinden article It seems more than odd that you should seem so determined to enter an edit war in only your first day as an editor instead of fixing the egregious error that would strike any true contemporary of Jeremys immediately May I therefore suggest you take three actions 
1 Go read WPNPA yet again just in case it hasnt impinged 
2 Add links and content to the Marc Sinden article that reflect and respect the memory of your school chum Jeremy Sinden because in all the puffery of Marc poor Jeremy seems to have been wholly ignored 
3 Expand the content of the Jeremy Sinden article such that it at least matches the Marc Sinden article because it is a disgrace that the puffedup Marc Sinden article is perhaps ten times the size of the Jeremy Sinden article when Jeremy was perhaps ten times more notable  go and put this right 
Finally as an observation as a contemporary of Jeremy you would be around 60 years old  it is both surprising and disappointing that with such advanced age has not come the sense of insouciance and the wisdom of seniors that one might normally expect May I suggest that you therefore refrain from further conflict and personal attacks and put your editing efforts to work exclusively on the person you do know about Thanks
