Phase TWO Consensus Buidling 
I would say that it is notable that Long gave a speech and that speech was covered national for the first time likely Under WIKI rules that sentace meets guidelines it is NPOV and it is verfiable I contend it cannot be deleted by a warring editor on his own whim

Now I say lets discuss whether it SHOULD be in the article I think it can be without question I dont think it wise to hold this article to so much scrutinty that no one can edit it without challenge That would be totally wrong SO I suggest we move on from notability to real consensus building as to whether it should be in For a lack of a better term lets just call it Notableenough Is it notable enough to be in there under wiki rules I have said that it is not the most important thing around It is not I understand that others think it may not be But I dont think the case has been made that it is not notable but that good points have been made as to whether is is notable enough
