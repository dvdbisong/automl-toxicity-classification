Proposed Controversy Section

1 I requested administrator assistance because of user mongos unrelenting deletion of anything I post including a NPOV Template at the top of the articlehe removed it within minutesthe template states it should not be removed until the issues are discussed and resolved
2 Im simply proposing a Controversy Section or any separate section with the following
Outside Magazine revealed Kellogg used the powerful steroid dexamethasone for an Everest speedclimb attempthttpwwwoutsideonlinecomfitnessClimbingsLittleHelperhtml
The above powerful steroid dexamethasone is in the subtitle of the article and the paragraph on Kellogg is about 30 paragraphs from the top
3 Im open to different wording
4 Mongo objected to this with various personal objections about the climber  Mongo did not propose other wording or any other alternative  Instead he deleted it within minutes and did not suggest discussing it nor would tolerate any discussion  Isnt this a violation of wikipedia conduct
5 Fact  National media Outside Magazine did an article on the matter its a critical article and the journalist did a paragraph on Kelloggs use of the prescription drug on Everest
I will try to find other mention of Kelloggs use of the drugthere is mention of it at his sponsors blog Outdoor Research
6 Administrator could you inquire into whether other moderators etc are joining together to control the information in the article
7 Could you ask for a third party to take part
