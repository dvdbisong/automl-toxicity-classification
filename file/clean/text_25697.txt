Ain Kades 

I have made a redirect from Ain Kades Ain Qedeis Ein El Qedeis Ain Kadis to here but on second thoughts possibly I should have made it a separate article

Ain Kades was the presentday place most commonly identified with Kadesh Barnea between about 1880 and 1916  But its not the same place as Ain elQudeirat which is where the articles coordinates point to and which is where Kadesh Barnea is now most often identified with

If anyone wants to write up a separate article for Ain Kades this webpage  has quite a lot of material on how it came into scholarly popularity and then fell out of it again  That page is part of a quite useful whole miniwebsite  on Kadesh Barnea and different things that have been written about it over time although the website does very much wear its heart on its sleeve the author writing from a committed Biblical inerrantist point of view and a conviction that site near Petra is where Kadesh Barnea should properly be located
