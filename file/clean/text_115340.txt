I agree with  This reads like an attack on the theory rather than an explanation of it I cant hardly see the theory as a whole because it is so littered with that Please change it in the way this user stated Other articles are covered in that way and both the ideas and the rebutal of the ideas are clear in that form This page is an attack not an encyclopedia article Very nonwiki I suggest you fix it I dont think I should give it a try since I dont know much about such subjects thus Im looking here I agree that the theroy and the opposing facts should be seperated Also you are right no need for another article just for the media information A section will do Seperating it just gives the topic a favor towards looking true
