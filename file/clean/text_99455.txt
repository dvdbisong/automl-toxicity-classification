Thanks for your comments As for my failure to provide diffs for mediation  arbitration purposes regarding offensive reverts without offending party allowing discussion dont worry I have all the relevant diffs Where I come from my understanding is that complainant first states grievance responding party then replies and indicates whether hshe agrees or disagrees if the latter then complainant files evidence ie would be diffs in case of wiki But it seems wiki process has other rules And even if there are rules the rules are worthless as youve apparently stated above 

 Re your If youve already supplied page numbers and are saying they werent received appropriately please supply diffs of your edits with the citations and of the responses that youre taking issue with Okay the archives are full of examples but heres a recent example submitted 23 August 2010 relative to denazification and improvement WW2 Aftermath section and still on the current talk page above so diff isnt necessary
