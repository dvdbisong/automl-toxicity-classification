Leviathan Review 

Wikipedia defines a worthy review as Professional reviews may include only reviews written by professional music journalists or DJs or found within any online or print publication having a paid or volunteer editorial and writing staff

Our website is obviously an online publication we have advertise for large clients like Nick Cave and The Big Day Out Music Festival and our staff is a mixture of paid and volunteer workers

So the review should stay there you have no legitimate reason to take it down
