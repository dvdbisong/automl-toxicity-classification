Reply to  request As an editor which you are you are encouraged to be bold and fix it yourself  You should feel free to choose the phrasing you feel is best and dont be too surprised if another editor later makes changes That is the nature of a collaboratively edited encyclopedia  If you want to gain the consensus of other editors it is better to ask this sort of question on the articles talk page rather than on a User talk page  You will get the attention of more interested parties there     Talk  Contrib
