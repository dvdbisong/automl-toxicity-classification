Move to Philadelphia 

The Youth Study Center has moved to West Philadelphia their building has been demolished and a bare site awaits the beginning of construction for the new museum at 2001 Benjamin Franklin Parkway just west of the Central Library I believe all the legal obstacles have been overcome but a few diehard Barnes students continue to argue against the move  Of course the Barnes Foundation Arboretum is going to stay in Lower Merion  Someone should find references for the current situation and update both this article and the Albert C Barnes article
