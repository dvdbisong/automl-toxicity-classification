true cooperation will likely never happen 

cooperation is asked for but is true cooperation asked for

I dont have any problem with the NPOV rule  I just see censorship over and over Wikipedia is clear

None of this however is to say that minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can possibly give them on pages specifically devoted to those views There is no size limit to Wikipedia But even on such pages though a view is spelled out possibly in great detail we still make sure that the view is not represented as the truth 

Now I have wanted to have cooperation and have good faith efforts on both sides  I have listened to the other side and taken feedback I made some changes although admittedly not a lot  

However Cooperation may never happen  Why

Here is why

1  Does some person keep changing the theological conservative Christianity  internal link in the Biblical scientific foreknowledge BSF article so it goes to the Christian right Falwell etc  Would a person who wants to act in good faith do that 

2 Would people who act in good faith send harrassing messages fundie etc  

I think the people calling for cooperation yet saying absolutely nothing publically about the bad behavior of certain  antiBSF parties are not seeking true cooperation  What they are asking for is the minority view be trampled despite the Wikipedia policy

addendum
The Bible says the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things  The above devious tactics are not a great surprise   Now you can pretend that someone is not changing the conservative Christianity link to Christian right   You can pretend MickWest is not harrassing me with messages to my userpage I said I did not want but that doesnt make it so  You can choose not to view duncharriss userpage  That is your choice but dont ask me to endorse it  I am not going to  I am not going to exist in LaLa land and pretend MickWest and Duncharris are reasonable  They have shown they are not and it is likely not going to change  I can adjust to this and recognize this matter  I suggest you do the same 

Now you say BSF is minority  Does the Bible say the universe had a beginning  Do scientist increasinng recognize this matter  Do major medical historians recognize where the Bible was ahead of its time Yes they do   Now I cannot help peoples ignorance regarding these matters but I am not going to let it decide for me my position
