So Necrothesp lets get this straight You wrote an article on a woman whose crowning achievement seems to be that she ran a pottery company for something a bit over a year before World War II with her husband and yet you doubt the notability of a woman who has curated at least nine exhibitions over a period of 20 years at one of Australias most important art galleries and continues to do so Should I remind you that four years later your article only has one reference no notes and no external links
Its not that I dislike the disambiguation page Im all for it and would certainly agree with adding a reference to a disambiguation page on this one once the move has been made But it seems entirely sensible to me to have a page for the only entry thats currently for someone unambiguously called Julie Robinson at the address httpenwikipediaorgwikiJulie_Robinson and have the disambiguation page at httpenwikipediaorgwikiJulie_Robinson_disambiguation If someone else more notable comes along with a claim to that exact address Id happily support her taking this page too
