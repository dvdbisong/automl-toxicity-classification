Yes we should follow what the sources say but since the source regarding Obama eating dog is about Obama eating dog it doesnt belong in this article which is about a dog named Seamus and his owner Mitt Romney  Furthermore the fact it is not just myself but now a journalist pointing out that the Romney camp is committing a logical fallacy it would be irresponsible for us to publish said logical fallacy as a serious encyclopedia  As an aside Podhoretz is wrong about the fallacy involved as this is ignoratio elenchi not reductio absurdum but thats neither here nor there  talk 0546
