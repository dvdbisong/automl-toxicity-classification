Wanted to add my welcome and thanks for the help with DDrelated work  I do a lot of work in this area too and its always nice to have another pair of eyes and hands around

One thing  we cant add just any photo scanned from a magazine or found on the net since the copyrights belong to the photographer  Please read WikipediaCopyrights and WikipediaImage use policy for more details  If you believe the photos youve added can be legitimately used here please provide more information on your reasoning and the sources of your images on the photos Image description page otherwise Im afraid many of them are going to have to be deleted  Its a shame because youve put a lot of work into providing and placing great photos but we have to be very careful to have legal rights to everything we put up here  Wikimedia is a nonprofit organization which cant afford to be sued over this  

I had to learn all this copyright stuff the hard way myself when I was looking for photos to put on the Duran Duran article which is now a featured article btw the ones that are there now are press release photos which Wikipedia has decided can be used if theyre tagged with  one of the Wikipediaimage copyright tags  Its a tangled mess but please ask on my talk page if its unclear and Ill do my best to answer questions

Thanks for all the hard work  talk  aka artslave
