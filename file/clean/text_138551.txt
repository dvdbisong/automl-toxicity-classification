Issue with Map 

Using the light green color for Crimea seems somewhat misleading and inconsistent The China map uses the same light green color for Taiwan even though the situations are not similar at all China has no control over Taiwan and the people dont want to join China Russia has total control over Crimea with the approval of its people In reality Crimea is not a contested territory except in the minds of politicians I think Crimea should be labeled as fully part of Russia on the Russia page and marked with some other color on the Ukraine page that represents territorial claims without control This should be the same color used for Taiwan on the china page A different color should be used to mark contested territories where multiple parties have actual influence over say if Crimea was controlled by Russia but its people were not happy with the Russians and were protestingrebelling
