Hi Bogdangiusca Thanks for blocking me I mean this from the bottom of my heart Since I am clearly a child who needs to sit in the corner with a dunce cap on and learn my manners this is exactly where I should be So I see your act of blocking me as an act of kindness and consideration for me and for the entire class which I have obviously disrupted The teacher who is always right has the certain and inalienable right to do just this 

Freedom after all is a thing which should be ascertained not by the people but by the government which rule the people This is a thing that is agreed upon by all states monarhcies socialist states fascist states republics that have been overtaken by oligarchies etc So I cannot do otherwise but to agree that your block is correct We did have a chance at real freedom here in the USA at one time But alas it was doomed from the start by those who would steal it to ensure their own freedom and not that of us the people

I do have a question though May I ask why you blocked me now for something that I am accused of doing yesterday Why did you not block me yesterday duck talk
