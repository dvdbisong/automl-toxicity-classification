Nicknames 

He has been calling himself the King of Kings of late but that doesnt mean its an official nickname  I seriously doubt other announcers or other wrestlers will be calling him that either note unlike The Game or Cerebral Assassin  Same goes for the Greatest Wrestler Alive Today a selfanointed name as well as crony Ric Flair  I dont think anybody in wrestling calls him Trips and thus Ive removed all of these
