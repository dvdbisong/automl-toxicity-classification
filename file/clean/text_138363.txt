North Africa is a vast region a large region that spans a huge geographical locale much greater than that of Western Europe Enmeshing all these different groups of people together for the sake of simplicity on your part I suppose is unfair unethical and false Much of the information that is posted regarding their origins is false and based on a study conducted in Southern Morocco near the border of Mauritania As the studies were conducted by europeans who often look for the exotic element we cannot even be sure that these were inhabitants of the region and not maurauders Basing the findings of this study to for instance the Kabyle people who do not think of themselves as Berber as they are racially apart culturally as well and even geographically reside mainly in mountainous regions in algeria is absurd and grave As a native of the region I am saddened by the distortion of so many peoples on wikipedia a source that is edited by anyone people such as the madman who thinks that only blacks exist in Africa which is as the world knows false and an absurd proposition The fact that you keep removing my posts and allow his to remain is very strange I am contacting wikipedia at once
