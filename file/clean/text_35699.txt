Hi there Seeing the crusading fixated nature of MM I would have serious doubts about any information that he inserted into the article here I restored the infobox info and deleted the diffamatory categories but I seriously doubt the stuff he has inserted into the main text From what I can gather if the people were not Akan true Ghanaians according to MM then he otherwise slurs them as being of the Ewe tribe Togolese and so on
BTW you did the right thing posting at BLPN several people reacted rapidly resulting in an indef block of Mark Mysoe if you werent aware already WikipediaAdministrators_noticeboardIncidentsMarkMysoe_blocked_indefinitely
So feel free to edit those articles knowing that the guys blocked watch out for similar style editing from IPs block evasion or new accounts editing in the same way socking Good luck  Parley
