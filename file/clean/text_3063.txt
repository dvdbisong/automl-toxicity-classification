And re the matter at hand  I agree and RS seems to support that megavitamin therapy is used by practitioners of orthomolecular medicine not the other way around  Unless theres solid RS showing that MVT is generally defined as or equated with OM I dont see any reason to mention it in the introductory sentence or conflate the terms  Ill certainly concede that its widely used as are megamineral megaamino mega therapies and will gladly stipulate to its inclusion in the opening section but I cant see my way beyond that  Any thoughtssuggestions anyone
