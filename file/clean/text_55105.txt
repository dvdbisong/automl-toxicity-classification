Number of edits is a pretty useless indicator  We have people whove made tons of edits to their user page but never contributed meaningfully to the project  And really we dont usually have a reason to bother wanting to judge other editors so I wouldnt worry about that very much  Keep in mind that Wikipedia is a community only insofar as is necessary to work on the encyclopedia  Since youve been blocked a few times lately I can only assume people think youve been disruptive to the project  From what you say this isnt at all intentional so mentorship sounds like a great idea to me  If you mean well but have trouble knowing what is or isnt helpful to the project this is EXACTLY what mentorship is meant to help with
