I did actually Even if you grant the forger enough expertise in Photoshop to cunningly so randomly age the documents to the point that you can not replicate most at all with a modern word processor  as well as make himher an exceedingly diligent researcher who carefully culled through all the DoD records to gather up convincing content minutia to a detail that exceeded greatly what bloggers and the even media could pick up on including a reference to the now redacted James Bath who was suspended exactly one month after Bush  you still have a couple of issues 1 someone so brilliant would very likely have been smart enough to have used some old typewriter like the still easy to find Selectric to create the forgeries and 2 you still have that Feb 2nd 1972 memo  with the reference to Bush and Bath having some sort of flight certification issues  information that could only have been derived by an analysis of Bushs flight logs but which were not released until AFTER CBS had obtained all the memos Those flight logs had not been available for over 30 years and even then likely only to Bushs superiors in the Air GuardUSAF The proforgery claims may start as a big pile but item by item it shrinks down to nothing under close scrutiny The they are real pile starts off a bit smaller but even after you take out CBSs incompetent dumbass handling of them there is still a pile left Like I said it is what it is and you should think instead really long and hard about what this all means especially in regards to the way the White House dodged answering questions about them as in the answer given to Stephen from Colorado Springs CO here I always find it interesting how Dan Bartlett fields the question there and how he gets mentioned and described in this long interview of Burkett there seems to be a certain consistency in behavior But again whatever BC aka
