Thats Wehwalt  Its been 20 years since I read the thing but in the book there were those who felt that they could solve the countrys severe economic problems by pressuring the intelligent to solve the problems  They were not successful  I do not think that if you put this into force that admins facing reconfirmation would solve the problems of RfA

I should add that I do support community desysoping  I would favor that the RfDS would have to get a consensus to desysop and possibly some minor restrictions lets say seven days notice to the admin before you can start one and perhaps each editor is limited to one attempt at a desysop per month  And if the desysop fails the admin cannot be taken down that road for six months  That kinda thing
