The request for community input has lapsed and there is overwhelming support for the primary name of the creature to be changed to xenomorph Guidelines for consensus does not require all parties be supportive of the change

I repeat There was no early closure by anyone Its just that everyone disagrees with you that it should remain alien and disagreed with you for the entire 30 days of the request
It was inappropriate of you do reopen this request the reason you gave in doing so is invalid and it was inappropriate of you to reverse the agreedupon change
I will be reporting your actions to an administrator
