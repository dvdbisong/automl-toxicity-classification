Youre the one assuming youre the same person since you have a different IP address who claims Chang doesnt exist at the Genome Projectprove it Again I quoted 2 sources with people who actually WORKED in the Genome Project who say they arent sure Chang existsbut that he COULD exist there for all they know If you have evidence Chang has never worked there prove it I emailed Carolyn J Brown who is affiliated with a Samuel C Chang working in genetics to see if its the same person but have yet to get a reply If you have better things to do go do them and stop worrying about this article if it bothers you so much If you have other deeper realms of truth contribute them already However I still think the hoax is notable to mention as I have neutrallyhell Ive even provided 2 sources that pretty much negate its validity but that doesnt negate its notabilityespecially considering Zecharias theory
