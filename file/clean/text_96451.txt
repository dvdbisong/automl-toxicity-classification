Secretary of the federation is 2001  2004 Wladimir Ruschailo he has to be asked as well towards the topics because his period ended as well with the beginning of putin

Ivan Rybkin was the securitysecretary of the russian federation and as well specialsecretary for the Tschetschenienwar He was called Mr Consens so he made peace with them in a mute way  the opposite of Putin a loud war And this was as well the topic of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko the war against Tschetschenien which should be strategic product of burning the house downPutin in their eyes
