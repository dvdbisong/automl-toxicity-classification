Im worried that this 10 minute headway is
 1 Completely arbitrary If there is no source for it then it really should be dropped
 2 Many of these metros have less than 10 minute headway during periods of the day How is this accounted for
Im trying to get to the criteria we use to determine what is a metro system The only reason we are having this argument is that the criteria for what is a metro is not well defined here 
No criteria should be proposed without a source to back it up No more arbitrary rules made up by random editors
