I stand corrected then about exactly who added the material The questions now become is the material supported by the reference is the reference WPMEDRS and is the material worthy of inclusion A previous arguement about including similar XMRV material in the main Chronic Fatigue Syndrome article was that with all the publicity of the studies readers would expect some coverage in the WP article It would seem a difficult question that will have to be reached by editor consensus Perhaps an RFC to draw some more editors in would be in order
