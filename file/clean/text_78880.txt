Hi VQuakr  I just saw your message from Dec 15 I understand your policies now I have made no more edits since then Is it possible now to remove the warning banner on the article about it possibly being autobiograpghical  that was not my intent in making the edits I made Thank you 
I notice this article has not been edited since I last removed some promotional content For to no longer be an autobiography it needs to be substantially edited by someone other than yourself which has not happened yet Feel free to start a discussion about whether the tag is still needed on the article talk page but since most of content that is there now was created by you it makes sense keep appraising any readers of the article of its status
