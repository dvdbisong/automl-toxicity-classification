 Romeo and Juliet comparison 

This is the quote I found from the source given the other source seems to be a dead link
Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative but its Shakespearean said Borden who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet We took from the best

I see this has been discussed before and there doesnt seem to be a conclusion so let me give my two cents The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world and thats the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet Theres an enormous difference  Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy for one Lets just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet

Moreover if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare you will know that Shakespeare created nothing His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid who probably heard the story as a folktale His other tragedies  Hamlet King Lear  are the same The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse It has nothing to do with creativity and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeares plot  which has been around for centuries It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on

All this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Bordens claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet  is it babbling or is he simply ignorant We do not know But we do know that his comparison is at best doubtful Yes it is a verifiable source it comes from the writers own mouth and it is not my place to judge him wrong but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writers mouth  as far as I know no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as The writer of the play claimed that as it is not exactly a notable claim either nowhere else in the article is it mentioned except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence Or better remove it   
I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient Id be a little dubious because besides it being possibly selfpromotion the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that like what you said about the Bard they werent that creative    

Ok  I have now posted 5 more references not from the author but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements I also fixed the dead link I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same or similar description  As to the obvious similarities meeting at a party a balcony scene each has their gangs the thwarting of a parents will rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics May this be the end to this conversation now Thanks for allowing me to post more references  Please read them all and you might learn something  
Oh yes  of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story  They too were based on elements of the RJ story I feel silly even having to point this stuff out but it keeps coming up Lets see  Grease wasnt a tragedy either except its message of dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted  Shakespeare created nothing Gee I guess that is why RJ is perhaps the most adapted play of all time See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet I have though  has anyone on this page read it I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have And just so you know  Shakespeare did indeed add to the plot and created characters that hav
