Companion Books Information 

I noticed that we didnt have any information for the companion books such as The Demigod Files or the upcoming The Ultimate Guide Should we add a section for these I mean not in detail maybe just a note like 

Companion Books
The Demigod Files
MainThe Demigod Files
The first companion book of the series The Demigod Files was released on February 10 2009 
featuring three short stories various pictures and interviews of campers It serves as an introductory 
guide to Camp HalfBlood

The Ultimate Guide
This is the second companion book that is to be released in February 2010 It is to feature a guide to 
the gods the camp the monsters the labyrinth and a lot more all illustrated in full color

Ok the above serves as nothing but an example since I dont really do well at encyclopediatic writing However I really hope that sections or information like this would be written into the article Thanks
