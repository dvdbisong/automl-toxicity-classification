Three hundred thirtytwo MTF transgender persons 112 African American 110 Latina and 110 API completed the survey  The 3 most common selfidentified genders were female 36 preoperative transgender 31 and preoperative transsexual 21 Few had undergone sexual reassignment surgery among them 73 identified as female and 24 as postoperative transsexual A majority identified as heterosexual
This points out an interesting thing  The large majority of the transgender individuals in the survey were preoperative  Since the only receptive intercourse available to them is oral or anal they are more likely to engage in URAS  Honestly I like the idea of URAS it should be People engaging in URAS as the risk category and we could avoid this whole whos male whos female idiocy
