No you dont use any logical organization Gold medals are the most valuable and the reader need to see them first to do a organization into their minds Its useless to put medals in order that the athlete won That does not matter to the reader The reader wants to know the golds silvers and bronzes the athlete won and starting from the first to last you still make stupid to put on the contrary to leave everyone confused It is not possible for the reader to make a decent compilation of his head with everything so messy
