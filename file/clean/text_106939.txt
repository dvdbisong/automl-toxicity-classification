regardless of your opinion on that matter its really moot No poll ever done has shown that he is considered greater than Schumacher In fact all the polls ever done have shown Schumacher the greatest above him with Senna trailing a bit behind Fangio is always a distant third Hes not the peoples greatest hes not the experts greatest and hes not statistics greatest Calling him greatest in any capacity is intellectually dishonest Further you CAN prove someone is the best via data and statistics which has already been done by a well known race car driver biographer And popularity can be polled as well Fangio loses on all accounts
