To insult a historian is free to say that these statements are not backed up by reliable sources that is a very big mistake The limits of Patagonia and the ones of Chile and Argentina have been very well documented by Carlos Morla Vicu√±a and Perito Moreno in 1880 Frederic Lacroix in his History of Patagonia  in 1841 defines all the limits also Raul Rey Balmaceda in Geografia Historica de la Patagonia  in 1976 confirms the limit of Northern Patagonia which are stated by me The same is true to the historian Enrique Campos Menendez in his work  El alma de la Patagonia based on a careful study done at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville he states clearly the limits in year 2002 Also from a point of view of its Flora and Fauna look at Hans Steffen So you have many different ways to reliably understand the same argument both political geographical nature human and cultural To try to change the history and geographical references in year 2010 its a joke If you are stating the above with good reference I will be happy to continue with this matter uderwise it would be considered an offence made without any support and a waste of your time and mine
