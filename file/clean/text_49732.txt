I thought that the Buick LaCrosse was using the BAS system in the 2012 models as of Aug 2011  At any rate Id surely like to see a photograph of the installation the belts and batteryies  Since this E boost system operates on 36 volts some discussion would be helpful since all other components of the Buick electrical system remain on the conventional 12 volt system
