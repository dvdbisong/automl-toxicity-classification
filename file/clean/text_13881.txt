Knowledge of Dipterocarpaceae  

Wow Im not even sure how to say that word Have we recently crossed paths editing somewhere   WikHead  

To be quite honest I dont really know a lot about trees I am however searching for a good central treerelated talkpage for you somewhere where you might have a better chance of attracting other users with the knowledge you seek If I can find a good link I will most certainly post it here to your talk page    WikHead  

Youre most certainly welcome Im guessing that the talkpage at Wikipedia talkWikiProject Forestry might be a really good place to find other users who can be of most help to you I wish you the very best of luck with your updates Have yourself a great day Curritocurrito and happy editing    WikHead  

Hi Curritocurrito thanks for your post at WikiProject Forestry If you could elaborate a little more either there or at TalkDipterocarpaceae about what specific additions you might suggest for that article that would be helpful Thanks   
Thanks for your reply I suggest that you add your questions  why are they important what habitat are they living what animals eat their seeds are they important economically what minerals or grounds they need  to the TalkDipterocarpaceae page That will help others think about how they might contribute to that article   
I dont get much time to edit Wikipedia pages but am slowly trying to creat stubs for all the Dipterocarps and correct errors in existing stubsarticle If anyone is interested in editing these pages and needs access to primary sources  I have a reasonable collection of papers mainly for SE Asia and can send pdfs
RE the questions raised above
are they important economically  they use to be the main timber export from SE Asia I dont have figures for what  of the timber trade they account for now
what minerals or grounds they need variable  there is a high degree of habitat speacilsation Some species only occur in Peatswamps other in poor sand soils ie heath forests others on rich clay soils
what animals eat their seeds  when they fruit which varies from yearly in some of the Sri Lankan species to onces every x 216 years in some of the Borneo species  they are an important food source
