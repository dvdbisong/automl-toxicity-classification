Robert Walker 

You were patient on Robert Walkers talk page and tried to be sympathetic to an editor whom you thought was still learning how to use talk pages  Patience and sympathy are virtues but he isnt an inexperienced editor who is learning  He is an editor with a history of excessively long posts to talk pages who has in the past been taken to ANI for his talk page behavior  I dont think that he is interested in working on a noncontroversial article to learn  He decides what he wants to work on he isnt working to learn because he is working to express his views  I have tried to help him learn in the past and he hasnt benefited from learning  Thank you for trying
