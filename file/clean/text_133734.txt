Firstly The concept of state terrorism as it applies to declared war is inherently fringe The USA and the Empire of Japan were engaged in a declared war The idea of war terrorism as outlined in the article now is a a neologism and shouldnt be included on Wikipedia When you include information on the targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets and were defended by an air force What you have included and reverted to goes on about the use of air power in unrelated conflicts as if that too were terrorism Terrorism and terror terrifying are different things A declared war between 2 nation states is certainly terrifying but it isnt terrorism and as such the opinions of a the few college professors who specialize in this are given undue weight here 
Secondly I am not the one who is edit warring  Per the WPBRD cycle you were bold and added material to the encyclopedia I disagree with the materials inclusion and reverted It was objected to That is where you were supposed to take it to the talk page and discuss the changes instead you reverted Thats edit warring
