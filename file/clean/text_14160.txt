The only problem I have about this image is that you inserted BroadwayCity Hall as a transfer station What I thought was considered a transfer station is a station where you can change from a line to another Bridgeport I believe is counted as one because it can transfer to either YVR or Richmond CentreBrighouse but Broadway doesnt go to any other line except for the Canada Line What are your thoughts on this  LAKERS
