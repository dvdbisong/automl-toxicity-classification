WikiProject Mixed martial arts
Ever thought of joining WikipediaWikiProject Mixed martial arts  I noticed you have lots of MMA related edits  We are now taking suggestions for the new MMA article improvement drive  please add your input to decide what the first collaboration should be  

I probably should get around to joining at some point I dont think I have the time right now to contribute much to the article improvement drive but I keep my eye on several MMArelated articles for vandalism nonsense etc Ill probably throw my name in the members section  

Ill second that your contributions show youve made a lot of positive edits to MMArelated articles Keep up the good work 718

 Great job 

catching that linkspammer and reverting vandalism in general Have you thought about trying out Twinkle It makes vandalism reversion much easier and also streamlines warning users  718 at 0126 September 12 2007 

Looks interesting I may have to check that out 

 Arbitrary revision reverting 

If you are going to reverse a revision that has been researched and well crafted be consistent across the board  Compare content with other similar entries which are considered acceptable then rethink your actions  Read the Muhammed Ali Fedor Emelianenko Chuck Liddell biographies for examples of what is considered relevant information particularly regarding fight descriptions  Make changes to all of those wiki entries if you feel that your standards should be universally accepted 
Please see WPOTHERSTUFFEXISTS Im sure Tuckdogg will get around to cleaning up those articles too 718 at 2017 September 25 2007
 is correct at least as to the LiddellFedor pages Chuck hasnt been on my watchlist but I think I should add him 
Ive copied the MMA portion of my watchlist to  for your use just visit  and paste at the bottom theres probably a few leftovers from other topics though 718 at 0041 September 26 2007
Holy friggin crap dude Suddenly my watchlist doesnt look so insanely large
