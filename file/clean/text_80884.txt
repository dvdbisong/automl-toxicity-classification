Hi Peridon

I have to respectfully disagree with part of the advice you have to a new user on User_talkLegl6836Help re Emotion  viz   I think that gives the wrong impression to a new user as Ive explained on their page yes technically it is true  but at core yes you do need refs for almost every fact except common knowledge if you dont want someone else to remove it  is poor advice IMHO If a new user does not understand the clear core value of verifiability then they are very likely to experience huge problems  especially as in this case theyre mistakenly introducing original research

Hoping that you dont mind this criticism which I want to be constructive I also hate to contradict another helper but in this case felt I had to and tried to do so as diplomatically as possible as youll see on eir talk Best
