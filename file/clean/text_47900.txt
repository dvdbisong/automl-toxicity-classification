First J Greb is a volunteer just like the rest of us hopefully if you take that into account your tone will be a little less sarcastic Second apparently on that talk page where no one posted opposition they actually did  and requested you provide cites for your change which you did not Be careful that through your surely accidental yet still incorrect portrayal of events that you do not appear to be editing in bad faith Im sure thats not your intent thus I would suggest you reread the discussion on the talk page to see where you erred in your determination that there was no opposition to your edits As it appears to me the other editors are waiting on the proof they have requested  and offered to discuss the matter further if that is forthcoming They also seem to have pointed you to another article where this has been discussed cited and covered Hope that helps I know Wikipedia can be a bit daunting  and discussions can sometimes drag on for days or weeks so I politely suggest patience and working with the community Best   TKCN
