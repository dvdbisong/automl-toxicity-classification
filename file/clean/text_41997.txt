First I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page and would like to thank him for his research and work Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable I can post the references again if necessary they are not original research they are also impartial in presenting the Faiths teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Bahai teachings about the life of the soul after death This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here

When we discuss an opinion we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion For instance rather than asserting that The Beatles were the greatest band ever locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made Likewise the statement Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey a claim such as The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart can also be made because it is verifiable as fact The first statement asserts a personal opinion the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources

Also the Bahai Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Bahai World Center Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers worldwide
