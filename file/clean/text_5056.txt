Hi I am very new to this and I am int he process of attempting to setup this wiki page on behalf of the band The Breaking News This page is simply to provide information to the public regarding the formation of the band and the members in it There will be no attempt of advertisingsalesmarketing as a result of this page

I have added external links to allow members of the public to access content related to the band itself eg Sample music and further information Non of this external content if a chargeable service and if the band choose to go down the online sales avenue the links to any sales related pages will be removed from this wiki article

Lastly all I can advise is that I am new to this I am in the process of creating and wording this wiki page in accordance with your guidelines and will be retaining the page from public access until I can create the page correctly and comply with all rules

I welcome all advice and guidelines available from you
