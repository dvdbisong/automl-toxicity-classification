Royal Holloway Anti Cuts Alliance 

Can I ask why this section keeps being deleted from the Royal Holloway page It is relevant information about a large notable and legitimate student organization and it is not written in a biased way I see no reason why it should not be included many other university pages have similar articles Further to this the organization is recognised by both the SURHUL and the Principals It is not inappropriate political content it is true and factual information about a very relevant student organization
