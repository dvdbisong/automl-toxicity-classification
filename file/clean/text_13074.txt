Re Well when I first read this article I thought that 98 of it was neutral in tone and informative so if you wrote most of it you did a good job It was only a couple of things I thought were problems  Thank you for the compliment  I did write most of this entry with helpful edits by Pisceandreams involving punctuation  If you check the history of this page youll see how many times Ive edited myself so as not to make this page sound like a fan page It took a lot of work and merciless selfediting  Ill agree to cooperate with you in discussing further conflicting edits on this page  Also again I apologize for obstinance  Some of it has to do with what weve discussed and some of it has to do with my own personal matters
