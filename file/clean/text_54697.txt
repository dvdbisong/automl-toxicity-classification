Youth Division 

Why has the youth division been removed There is no disscussion over its removal then who dared to remove it without any consent In the 0607 year Milan had alot of players injured which has resulted in significant inclusion of youth division players in to the first team I request the mods to please add the deleted contents

And Matt or whatever the squad numbers are taken from various breaking news that appear on acmilancom For eg the sqaud numbers for Vitofrancesco and Facchin were taken from this link httpwwwacmilancomNewsDetail_popupaspxidNews36113progr6
