RM text from Criticism section 

I have been bold enough to remove the following text from the Criticism section In 1944 Tito signed a the decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property without compensation of Yugoslavias ethnic Germans 73 and an additional law promulgated in Belgrade on February 6 1945 cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the countrys ethnic Germans 74
Reasoning 
1 Its culled directly from a text written by SuniÄ‡ for the IHR here 
2 As we have seen previously with other parts of the Criticism section it makes a complete dogs breakfast of the facts There was no additional law The AVNOJ decree of 21 Nov 1944 was passed into law by the Belgrade decision of 6 Feb 1945 It was the same thing If you are interested what the AVNOJ decision actually said was this Decision on the transition of enemy property into state ownership on state administration over the property of absent persons and on sequestration of property forcibly appropriated by occupation authorities Article 1 of the mentioned decision states precisely the status of ethnic Germans To be transferred into state ownership on the day this Decision becomes effective 1 All property of the German Reich and its citizens situated on the territory of Yugoslavia 2 All property owned by persons of German nationality with the exception of those Germans who were members of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan formations or are citizens of a neutral country who displayed no animosity during enemy occupation 3 All property of war criminals and their accomplices with no regard to nationality Full details can be found here 
3 Its untrue that Nov 44 decreeFeb 45 law cancelled the Yugoslav citizenship of the countrys ethnic Germans  this happened later in the summer of 1945 through their loss of voting rights Specifically the Provisional Plenary Assembly of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia passed a citizenship law on 23 August 1945 which stipulated in article 16 that members of those nationalities whose states had taken part in the war against the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia and who during or before the war by disloyal  behaviour had violated the national and public interests of the peoples of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia and hence their duty as citizens thereof could be deprived of their Yugoslavian citizenship  its here 
4 Its quite hard to see how any of the stuff in question here can be converted into criticism of Tito
