RePublic or fairuse images from websites of 3rd parties 

In referrence to what you said on the image talk page work of the US government is in the public domain since its paid for with our tax dollars Since what you mentioned is a navy photo just add this tag PDUSGovMilitaryNavy to the images description In regards to fair use on videogame screenshots that information is found on the use page If you have trouble finding the correct image tags in the future try searching for articles that will have similar images in this case aircraft carrier or grand theft auto to see what tags they used Hope that helps
