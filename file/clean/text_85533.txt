As the discussion is now archived in your talk page archives Archive 64 to be exact I have modified the Wikilink at WikipediaPending changesClosureAnnouncement of result to point to User talkJimbo WalesArchive 64Announcement about Pending Changes which is the permanent home  Per your Wikipedia user page comments I boldly edited that section separately to note that the discussion is not to be edited and if anyone wishes to bring it up please start a new discussion here I have done this because of the direct wikilink and people may not see the notice at the top of the page in some cases  I hope this is considered all right and if not please feel free to personally revert that edit I simply am ensuring that people can find the discussion and am thus doing my part to prevent people visiting that page from trying to add to the discussion and not getting answered
