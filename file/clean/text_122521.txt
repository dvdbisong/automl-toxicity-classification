Kwai Chang Caine
The presence of guns is not always necessary for this kind of character in a western  For example in the television series Kung Fu Kwai Chang Caine is depicted much like a gunslinger but is a wandering Shaolin monk who instead relies on his mastery of martial arts when called for

True but guns were almost always present because the men that Kwai Chang Caine fought had guns on camera in the fight scenes
