The name used is for the languages spoken within Iran which is the South Azeri dialect written in the modified Arabic alphabet  Thus it is inconsequential how the languagealphabet of another country uses such a term  For example if the term Iran was used different in say the Persian of Afghanistan it is inconsequential for an article on Iran  In Iran no one writes Güney with such an alphabet in the Azeri publications there say newspapers  Because first of all they use the modified Arabic alphabet and second it is politically charged  Second the same region a good portion of it like all of Western Azerbaijan is called by Kurdish nationalists as Eastern Kurdistan  For example in the Northern Federal region of Kurdish Iraq they use East Kurdistan for all of West Azerbaijan with their own alphabet  However this does not mean we put Eastern Kurdistan in say the article West Azerbaijan for Kurdish language or here   Thus what matters is mainstream and official publications within Iranian Azerbaijan and even the term Güney is not used that much as the word Jonub is used for South more often then Güney   Also please do not edit war given the fact that your block was just lifted by adding controversial items
