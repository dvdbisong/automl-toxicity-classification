Editwarring 

Hello Brother Anselm  I just read your comment under the Five Pillars section of the EC business regarding block length  Is it true that automatically longer blocks are only applied in the case of repeated editwarring  Ive thought for a long time that the increasing length block idea applied to all kinds of misbehavior  Im no expert on wikipolicy  Am I mistaken in my understanding  9623111361
