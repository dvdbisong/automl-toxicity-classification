I have been following this technology for a while in Pop Science News articles as well as more academic sources  I do agree that this article reads a bit like an ad but this technology is definitely on its way  I hope that emotives system will be able to do all that it claims but since it will be the first device of its kind to hit the market I am skeptical  Even if it does end up being a subpar implementation of this technology I will rush out and buy it  I am not much of a gamer but with a good development kit I hope it will have a good development kit it will be amazing to see what sort of programs you could write with this  BCI interfaces are clearly the next wave  Why waist time and energy communicating your thoughts through clunky physical mediums when you can do it directly  Its all just information
