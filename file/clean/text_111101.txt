Yeah I did see that There are quite a few submerged churches in Mexico I know of two others One was flooded by a plantation owner who wanted the native residents of the community to leave in the 19th century The other was flooded when the Mexican government constructed the Miguel Aleman Dam in the 1950s Maybe some day they will emerge as well    snunɐɯ
