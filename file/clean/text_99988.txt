Ita140188 if you really want as much information as possible on Wikipedia then why have you supported the merger of the page specifically about the EuroVelo 7 with its parent page ie EuroVelo when it is clear that the EV7 page has greatly expanded information including an overview map and some images It seem completely incongruous with what youve said above Surely we should be expanding Wikipedia not stunting its growth In any case the EV7 page is set to be expanded by me hopefully others will too feel free to help
