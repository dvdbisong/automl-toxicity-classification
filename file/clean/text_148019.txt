Clearly you know very little about these bands as you wouldnt be saying some of the things you are You are Greenwald right Youve basically used this article to ballwash his lousy book that is in fact another stepping stone in the falsification of a misunderstood subgenre of hardcore music that was born with the worst name in the history of genre titles If youre not him then I hope hes paid you well to pimp his nam here

You know why these things are so little known Because the people that know about it that care about it arent writing for Rolling StoneSpin or sharing their thoughts on some famous blog or anything like that Where are these socalled reputable sources I dont need some celebrity gossip site telling me a band is emopop what and having this site link to that as if its factually correct I see a solid 9 links to the Billboard charts all for completely offtopic nonemo related material I must say the standard set for good sources here is criminally low

None of this is my point of view because I am simply talking about facts and events that really happened Yes those bands were real in the 90s and yes they played what is really emo Then the mainstream caught ahold of it and ruined it by plugging bands like SDRE and Weezer that had nothing to do with it Thats what really happened Why would there not be countless tales of this happening Because the mainstream media the only people that can put out articles in the mid90s before the internet buzz never heard of the damn word until those kind of popular bands started having it associated with their name Oh emo that must be emotional right And listen to this band They dont sound like anything else out there today Emo it is 

You think Im an elitist but Im just being a realist I see the full puzzle here What youre presenting in this Greenwaldquote stealing essay is only part of the puzzle The only thing revisionist is the idea that these poppunkindie rock bands had anything to do with a genre that was already changing and evolving from the hardcore scene it began in back in the 80s But no lets not give those bands a single sentence of credit in this poorly written article
