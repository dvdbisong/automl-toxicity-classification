OK We will read idle statements about Slavs who practised inhumation in the land to the south and cremation in the territories to then north of a line but whose movements across that line can be archaeologically proved Maybe the Slavs axes prove those movements because they did not give up using their weapons but they easily adopted burial rites Is there a difference between the axes used by Slavs who inhumated their dead and axes who cremated them
