The edits have been an attempt to fix the article which has predominantly been written by the subject himself and major portions of which were uncited  Those who have reverted the text back to its original form have done so without addressing the underlying problems  Unless those who keep reverting it back to its original form address the underlying issues I fear this may result in an Edit War
