Vocalizations is a rare word for me and not very specific it seems to mean anything produced with the voice from words to shouts to song If I read that I would think it actually meant coprolalia while I think what the source means is that he tends to express himself heatedly in discussions which is why I liked outburst which to me means passionate words but not nonsense A side comment when I was expanding the article I actually wrote to him and asked if he would be willing to release a freely licensed picture He wrote me quite a lot about how the Wikipedia mistreated him and after a few back and forths wouldnt release a picture if I couldnt guarantee our article would name specific Wikipedia editors who mistreated him No obscenities were involved but I could almost read him becoming heated as he typed  squeak
