Yea you are right I didnt see that picture anywhere els at Superherohype and Countingdown But some guy posted that picture at Countindowncom message board

The person that created that picture did a terrific job Damn

I would perfer his work than Sonys teaser pictureP

By the way there will be 2 villains Sand man  Venom Harry as been comfirmed to be the next goblin Hobgoblin
So I am wondering will Venom  Sand Man are to be in it will Harry be in it I am thinking Harry might appear in Spiderman 4

But Peter will meet a new girl in his life Betty It is said that someone close to Peter will die in this movie And I am greatly sure it will be Betty cuz its official Because in Spidy comics She dies and dies by the hands of Green Goblin So Harry will have to be in this movie

What about Venom In Spidy cartoon one the old one its kinda like modern the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings In that cartoon Spidey had the venom custome before then abandoned it and the venom came to Eddy Brook I am thinking the ending of this movie might be Peter leaving the Venom suit and the suit meeting up with Eddy then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4

Sorry if this is a spoilerP
I must be working for Sony PicturesP
