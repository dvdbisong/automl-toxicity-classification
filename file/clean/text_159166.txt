No Im afraid I am not there is nothing in that phrase that can be qualified in anyway as warrant to a warning And where have I used the everybody is doing it To the contrary I am ready to pay the price but THIS does not warrant any warning and I advice you to submit that phrase to any administrator and see what heshe has to say As for your adminsitrator abilities I judge what I see it is my right to question it you should not dump every critics when they are in ones talk page as incivility and justify a block Now you tell me how am I supposed to assume good faith when you  single me out on the middle of discussions that when my incivilities are compared to what is done else it is nothing while you appear to totally ignore those I simply request common sense Being administrator should assume that you know that the most important thing is what Wikipedia is it is an encyclopedia and articles are the most important thing You as an administrator are above all a user like any other user administrative privilages should only be used when a user is disturbing so for you to warn me you should justify how telling someone that he refuse to listen when he really refuse to listen warrant to a warning or how am I disturbing It is to you to convince me now that your blocking of a contributor a Wikipedian as much as you is not disturbing Also that you refuse to accept your mistake on the face of the obvious doesnt give a good opinion of you But I am sure that is the last of your worries Just consider that everyone make mistakes whatever or not they recognize it is what matters  ix
