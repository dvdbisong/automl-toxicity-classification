The rules against incivility and personal attacks are great in principle but it only takes a little bit of misinterpretation for them to be twisted into a weapon against all disagreement  Witness this case where you are penalizing me for saying that Deskana would be an incompetent admin  I stand by this assertion he lacks the skills necessary to do the admin job  I also stand by the assertion that there are others out there who became admins but are likewise incompetent  To penalize me for even expressing my views is to stifle all debate and turn Wikipedia into a censored environment  In short your reasoning is suspect as is your competency  You were required to rule on an existing block not search my Talk page for unrelated material that you can use to justify it  Calling someone actually or potentially incompetent is a reasoned conclusion not a personal attack  In contrast your thinskinned response is in violation of the spirit of free inquiry that drives Wikipedia  Since you did not attempt to do your job I will once again raise the flag in hopes of a more competent admin noticing  Your services however will no longer be required Jareth  You can join Nandesuka on my short list of admins who have proven their incompetence
