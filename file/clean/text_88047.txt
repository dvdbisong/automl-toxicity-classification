Im not defending or advocating anything  Its about notability  What makes Wikipediocracy notable  Editors are trying to keep the most visible and notable practice out of the lede for reasons that seem to be defensive about what should go there  Why do we need to tiptoe around it  It is what is  Calling them pedophiles would cross the line without reliable sources and that doesnt seem to be supported and is of course a crime  There should be literally no resistance to pointing out their main avenue of notability  which is investigating and exposing editors they believe are doing harm  Thats what they do  Thats what they are known for  Im not morally weighing whether they are right or wrong just stating what is the elephant in the room
