I now realise that this person was referring to private message to Connolley which was written as a result of an external website where he invites messages to be placed on his user page 

In short the kind of action you expect from Nazi brown shirts  no investigation no justice no chance to appeal and basically the only reason I used his homepage is that last time I sent him any comments I started getting huge amounts of spam  which although I cant prove are connected  it didnt exactly endear me to him or thrill me with the idea of giving him another NEW email address
