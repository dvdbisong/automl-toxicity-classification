As I understand it her historical campaign style has actually been to deliberately emphasize wedge issues for example bringing religion abortion and gun rights into a Mayoral race Its not obvious to me whether she even has positions on some of the other things for instance I suspect shes playing catchup on most foriegn policy issues I agree with you in spirit that we should be comprehensive in our coverage but we also have to keep in mind that some topics like prolife positions gun rights and oil exploration are more developed in part because those are things Palin herself has chosen to emphasize during her career
