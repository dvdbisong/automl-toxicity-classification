Hoping you will learn humility at your own pace 

Re  you are free and very much encouraged to participate on Wikipedia However please do so using the articles talk page first Repeatedly enforcing an edit and undoing the work of others will get you blocked  that is the blanket policy and with the exceptions of vandalism will happen regardless of the merits of the edits themselves

Sadly you are overstepping your bounds as administrator  A subheading does not amount to the work of others  It is a classification an needs to change as the content it classifies changes

Regarding the issue of nouns like state country and nation I recognize that there may be a consensus in terms of style  However the very article in question specifies how country in partcular is used with respect to the subdivisions of the United Kingdom  Certainly you cant hold the entire population of another state in violation of Wikipedia consensus  Clearly there is a question of internal consistency for this page  If the larger goal of Wikipedia has to do with conveying reasonably presented knowledge it will not do to cling to a consensus that conflicts with the knowledge being presented  You might be assisted by communicating with some experts on the subject whether these be geographers sociologists anthropologists or political scientists  Hiding behind Wikipedia policy in the face of inconsistently presented facts is not going to help the Wiki community
