I like the way its set up chronologically here in terms of rise to popularity first modern art music 1950s and 60s then punk 1970s then thrash and death 1980s then emo and posthardcore 1990s and 2000s Moving emo and such into the Punk section would break that up As for grindcore doesnt really matter to me where it is as long as the sources I dug up dont get removed
