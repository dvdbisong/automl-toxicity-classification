Requested move 6 November 2015 

Enchanted 2007 film    This was the title until recently when the article was moved presumably to accomodate the creation of Enchanted 1942 film However I found few if any sources indicating that the 1942 Czech picture was ever called Enchanted so I moved it to its original title Okouzlen√° That makes the date is unnecessary here as there are no other articles for films titled Enchanted It seems vanishingly unlikely that this would cause any confusion so policy would recommend we go with the more WPCONCISE title for this much more prominent film  tc
