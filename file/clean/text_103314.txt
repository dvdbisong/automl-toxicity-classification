And I think the article on Christianity is slightly slanted in favor of Christianity It is impossible to create a relevant encyclopedic article that might not seem slightly slanted to one or the other position because precision is impossible The goal of this or any article in Wikipedia is not to advocate or detract from any topic but to present what WPRS say on the topic using WPNPOV as a guiding principle and for the most part this article achives that I would like to use Adam and Moodleys framework but I can live without it 

Could you provide specific instances of how this is slanted In other words just saying it is slanted is not helpful provide us with specifics
