Fowlerfowler has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment 
Nichalp says in the present thread The term British India is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from Britishgoverned India I am sure there is some truth in that but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldnt about popular parlance it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship about detailed and correct information sourced as well as possible To put that more grandly it is about educating the world To illustrate this point in the popular parlance of much of the world Great Britain and England are much the same thing but by education people learn the difference between them To have an article on British India here even one with much improvement needed to it is a powerful tool in that process of education
On Nichalps suggestion that British India should be redirected to British Raj I and others do not agree with that for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far please see the discussion here and also at TalkBritish Raj And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect 
Fowlerfowler asks Would you be opposed to British India being redirected to this overview article British rule in India instead of British Raj  I of course am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article so I should be opposed 
In general I do agree with the overview article idea which has developed and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can but I do not believe British India would be a possible title for that overview article as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India  
One thought which I believe Fowlerfowler had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India For reasons of space the separation might one day be an advantage but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us
I hope these comments are helpful
