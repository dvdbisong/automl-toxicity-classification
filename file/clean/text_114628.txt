See WikipediaSockpuppet I dont think the info is misleading in the sense that Clarkson said you can buy a gun and bullets and yet not a drink in the US without a passport and it is our job to record what he said not to comment on the truth or otherwise of his comments I neither know nor care whether he said is true or not and I dont believe we are evn allowed to say whether his comments are true or not as that would count as original research The comment seemed fine the other day when i passed my editing hand over the article There are some political leftie types who edit this article but I am not one of them
