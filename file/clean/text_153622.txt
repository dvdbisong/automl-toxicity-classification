Main Villain 

Am I the only person who does not believe Henderson is the seasons main villain Really this season did not have one person that was equatable to a Marwan or a Saunders If one person had to be picked it would have to be Logan His role in the conspiracy was very comparable to Kingsley and the two shared a similar relationship with Graham and Max respectively So if one main villain had to be picked I would say its Logan
