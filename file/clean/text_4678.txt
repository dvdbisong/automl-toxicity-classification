I noticed at the time that Tango reinserted the material you blocked me for adding to Giles Hattersley but didnt think anything more of it distracted as I was dealing with my own blocking Now Ive just seen elsewhere that you blocked him aswell Subsequently reading the opinions at his talk page where he is unblocked after one hour especially from other admins over what constitutes a personal attack I am less than happy at how I got shafted over this incident in which you have still failed to show I was intentionally attacking Giano  you seem to have absolutely no shame in levelling the same theory at Tango an editor registered since Dec 2002 that you did to me that the simple fact we are experienced editors that would have never seen a users name linked in an article I am still entirely unconvinced this is even true especially for Wikipedia related text but I have not researched it we just should have known it was considered a personal attack blockable after no warning after making one editrevert Like I said I would be willing to take it as ignorance is no defence if this appeared in any policy text that I had just missed And judging by his unblock request he was not mistaken about what he was readding So quite clearly you are attributing some malicious motive to me that you arent to Tango Had I known of that discussion at the time I have a good idea that things might have gone differently for me Its not like I can do sod all about it now
