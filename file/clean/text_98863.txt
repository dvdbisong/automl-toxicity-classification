I absolutely agree the article should not be about the blog I am not proposing to introduce a paragraph merely one sourced sentence the SPLC maintains a blog whose mission statement is Keeping an Eye on the Radical Right Step back for a minute and look at this page reconsider your accusation of tendentious I am not the only person arguing for this position I did not even start this particular discussion I am starting to question whether your interest is to whitewash any mention of the political orientation of the SPLC The fact that political orientation is important to the SPLC is notable An encyclopedia should document notable things about the SPLC The SPLC documents this about itself The question is why do you keep trying to block statements about the SPLC by the SPLC Do you believe the SPLC is swayed by poltical orientation2181868245
