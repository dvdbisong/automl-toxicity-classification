RawTherapee 

Im wondering why Bytecs change in the section A list of Linux colormanaged applications of this article gets deleted as Spam
RawTherapee is a free RAW converter with color management running on linux and windows
If were not able to add this fact on our own could please someone with more rights and credits here can checkconfirm that and change the page accordingly  I like wiki but it should contain complete information not just part of the truth as other part is getting deleted as SPAM thats a pitty
Please check on the homepage of RawTherapee

Many thanks
Patrik
