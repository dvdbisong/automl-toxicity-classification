First there  is no question whatsoever about your replacement being better than the original blackonblack 

 Offhand I would prefer something showing a little more contrast perhaps the light green color that is now standard 

 Adding the phone plug to the picture does add context I would suggest using one that does not have the threaded retainer for the quarter inch adapter Perhaps adding a measurement scale to the picture would help also
