How to transfer stubarticle into my sandbox 

Hello Dr Scott  I have a quick question for you Im writing my article on Aspergillus terrus and its already a stub article on Wikipedia I want to expand it but Im not sure if I should make changes on the articles edit page or whether I should move the existing information into my sandbox as an external link where I can then continue the writing process Ive referred back to the Wiki Training for Students but unfortunately Im still confused 
Thanksin advance for your help
