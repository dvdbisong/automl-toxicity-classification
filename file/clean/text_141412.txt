The article still does not meet the standards of a neutral Wikipedia article It still reads as an essay style ie I believe this theory here is my proof This is understandable the main contributors have been antiIsrael warriors who have sought information to build their case against Israel The small criticism section does not solve the NPOV issues This article to be an appropriate Wikipedia article about an analogy needs a MAJOR rewrite to read more informatively and less preachily It needs to be encyclopedic describing only who compares Israel to apartheid and what their reasoning is It cannot be so apparently onesided If people have ideas as to how to deal with this issue I welcome discussion PS now that the discussion is no longer dormant I am reinserting the NPOV tag
