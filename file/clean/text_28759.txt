I wasnt thinking about anyone in particular I just noticed this word used several times on this page nothing more nothing less On a more general note the Frikorps Danmark business is of course relevant but so is the Resistance and the Danish sailors in British service The objective here must be to determine how best to describe the status of Denmark during WWII so if we mention Danes serving in one side it seems only fair to also mention those serving on the other Otherwise the overall picture will lose accuracy and this cannot be a good thing  talk  contribs
