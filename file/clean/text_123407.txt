What if one of the magnets were removedexample the N would the beam still split 
What if the beam started lower if the beam was closer the the S would more mass go to the S would there be a point where it would not split anymore How many people repeated this experiment
Answer In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons There is no spin no electrons It is a radiation pressure Seccond there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place they are apart of the same magnet How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment so it needs to be displayed how that is It is possible the are from two different magnets in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment  Seccond in the regionN S there is a tension like a compressed spring When the radiation leaves the mass it is effected by the tension This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge They dont exist Radiation has a direct effect on magnetism and this experiment needs to be redone and explored
