There are immense internal differences among Chakavian and Kajkavian speeches Northern Chakavian and Southern Chakvian border on complete unintelligibility No one argues that there are some ancient centuriesold isoglosses that ČaKaj share and there are just as many that ŠtoKaj and ŠtoČa share as well but overall degree of mutual intelligibility is very low apart from some transitional areas in the north Ill look to find some sources to back up the disputed statements Personal opinions and experience dont matter on Wikipedia unless they are written in reliable sources
