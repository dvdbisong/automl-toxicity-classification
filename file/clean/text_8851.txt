Four years after writing my vision is that Wikipedia should not say E is a fool when all it can really say is that D has called E a fool Lima has taken the opposite opinion in the same article  The preferred edit is that church teaching places the origin of the Eucharist in last supper and cites the Catholic catechism and Orthodox Encyclopedia and an Anglican Bishop  Reading the footnotes one discovers the cited passages to not support that thesis  And instead of reproducing quotes faithfully or arguing for some exception to a policy which requires verifiability the article is rerverted to the point of view of the editors  without even selective quotation

On the positive side Im learning a lot about Eucharistnot from this Wikipedia article I have to say as much as running down footnotes

I never knew the Eucharist was announced before the Last Supper until I read in the Catholic catechism  That tidbit doesnt appear in any Wikipedia article I read

The Last Supper is the institution of the Eucharist to Catholic not the origin according to the Catholic catechism cited here from 1993

Yet you couldnt tell it from our little article
