Im fine with not describing Aders hop as flight I only added Ader because he was before Vuia and is generally agrreed to have hopped farther than Vuia hopped in 1906 I assume from your use of quotes that you probably agree that there is a general consensus that Ader got off the ground in 1890 but not in his later craft and that his all to brief sojourn in the air was basically uncontrolled and unsustained If this is the case how would you feel about aknowledging his hop of 50 meters at minimal altitude I realize he made extravagant claims later in life which were unjustified but still most sources credit him with being the first to leave the ground at all under his own power
