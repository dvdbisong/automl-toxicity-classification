Did you even look at my edit before reverting it I did change it up as you wanted to say that Rex thinks it doesnt work  and as you said it hits on many things that are also said elsewhere in the article making it perfect for the lead  Just because it is stated elsewhere in the article by other sources doesnt mean we can also use this source  The more sources the better  I would suggest we both stop touching the article until you come up with a clear reason why it shouldnt be added  As I know all too well how this works no one touches it in order to finish this dispute and then the person who didnt want the information in the article will just stop discussing because they think they have won and then revert whenever the page gets changed
