redirection of The News from Nowhere Fellowship Symphony

Wow that was quick  Ive only just started writing the page  A previous reviewer left some very helpful advice re what needed to be added to make it comply whereas youve just deleted the initial content within the first few hours  is that really how this is supposed to work  I am confident that when the page is complete with all reference it will certainly comply with all Wiki guidelines  so not sure what to do next  Im guessing I now work on the page without saving and then when all is complete finally hit save  seems really risky  You can tell Im new to this but I cant see another way of starting a page and saving as you go along without it becoming subject to patrolling before its properly finished
