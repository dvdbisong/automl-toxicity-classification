Hi  Thank your mery much for your reply and particularly for taking so much time to argue and to check the Unregistred Wikipedians edits and you are completely right  Just btw and noticetomyself bad by me to mention just IP dont appreciate that term but to hurried As hopefully implied i did not intend to allege some unfaithfull edits to you 75147511 and therefore also no offense Was just confused short in time and honestly not much local KochiErnakulam experiences 

Related to the images btw also agree but there was one edit i was really unsure and motivated to start that section quotation General Hospital Ernakulam and Kochi Medical College Latter in fact Cooperative Medical College Kochi imho seems to be a bad name and also as of 17115 imho unsourced although started 1800 9 July 2011 by another user before No offense again tried checking before commenting here ecause was at the same time looking at Wikimedia Commons for an image to that wikie and hoped to add one single reference but just found httpcmccochinorg thats the prime cause to ask for comments Have you or other MalayalamKerala Wikimedians some more informations perfectly 

In all thank your very much enjoy the weekend and happy editings   

PS Every day a learning effect since 2006 in Wikimedia projects thank you and also in future reverts just in emergenices as insinuated and absolutely no plans to police Wikimedia though started an article to that theme what a curious online world and old man has to discover day for day  and hopefully to go asap definitely to KochiErnakulam or nearby Gods Own Country lets from my side closely dream for some minutes plan soon to retire and missuse friends
