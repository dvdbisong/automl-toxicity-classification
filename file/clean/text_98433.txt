Lets take a  good pause please 

Lets keep disputed tag on both versions of the article as things stand keep them linking to each other or even both on the same page lets call it a pause because this is such a waste of time and I have better things to do with mine I think before we work on any content we need to work out a method for discussing things between us and coming to agreement over them or at least accomodating acceptable disgreements and showcasing them where needed I think it would be better instead of fighting over two versions and reverting endlessly that we agree on facts on a pointbypoint basis and discuss the verifiable and reliable sources of each This is demanded by Wikipedia policies anyhow that content must be based on verifiable and reliable sources This would perhaps be my main suggestion and I request that everyone here please make comment on how we could make this work No content not for now but just process What process would you suggest and what would you find acceptable procedure Regards csssclll
