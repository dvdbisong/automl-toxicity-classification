My username doesnt show when editing in another language 

Hello Number 57

I wrote an article on Ohalo College in Hebrew מכללת אוהלו in the Hebrew Wikipedia and after saving it I realised I was not logged in and when trying to log in it did not let me Can I only log in in the English Wikipedia then Do I need a username for each language I use Now the history of this article doesnt show my name as the first editor and contributor

By the way I noticed you deleted my section Aims and Objectives from Ohalo College Is the reason because it might have been commercial
