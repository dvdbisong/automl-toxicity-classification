Truejusticeorg is a hate site Anyone who posts there has bought into the ethos of the site because any users with contrary views are banned i was in no sense searching for brmulls activity there i just happened to see his username since i read the site myself every few days Perhaps I shouldnt have mentioned it on Wikipedia but its done now By the way if there are any proKnox hate sites Id like to know which sites they are and who it is they are supposed to be hating   1511 7
