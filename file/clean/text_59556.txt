EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop but he suggested I ask you

Ive been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates a fairly common and sneaky problem Im not looking for full editfilter rights but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter If you dont have the time to deal with this right now let me know and Ill engage someone else

I am new to the syntax but heres my general format right now

user_editcount  50  article_namespace  0  lcaseadded_lines rlike dateofbirth birth dateyborn b   lcaseadded_lines rlike   lcaseremoved_lines rlike 

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex Ive been working on Below is what Ive developed so far I havent tested it extensively but Ive thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented either in template or in lead for example b January 1 2010

Heres the regex
date of birth bdash born birth datey  0309 janfebmaraprmayjunjulaugsepoctnovdec09012309 12093birth

I dont know how to check for what specifically was edited as in if a numerical value was changed Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing I welcome any other ideas you have I assume this will require more work But please let me know how to push this along
