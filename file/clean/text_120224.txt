Nlu Ive made edits to the alkyl nitritespoppers page that you have called vandalism  However each of those edits is based on sound evidence
It appears that this is a content dispute mistaken for vandalism  I am interested in finding a solution that fits within Wikipedia policies
I would appreciate it if you would explain why you consider the subject edits to be vandalism so that I may understand where youre coming from
If were not able to come to consensus I would recommend that we consider any number of the Wikipedia options for dispute resolution including but not limited to Informal Mediation Discussions with Third Parties Requesting an Advocate and finally if none of this helps using Wikipedias last resort Arbitration

Thank you
