Well objectively 200 PKK militants trained at Northern Iraq PKK military bases which are daily informed to US and Iraq governments to do some action against by Turkey entered from Northern Iraq carrying heavy weapons blew up a bridge attacked a military base on the other side killed 12 but some says 16 took 8 hostages but some says 10 then bunch of soldiers were injured and unlike in ZaritShtula PKK militants werent trying to free anyone They were just attacking a military base because it is their daily regular job I mean if you dont want to call it an attack a battle could be called because there was a battle and 32 out of about 200 were killed I wrote the article in Turkish Wikipedia and I called it 21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK battle because this what you call incident happens regularly Just like the 7th October 2007 Şırnak PKK battle where another dozen of Turkish soldiers were killed too Incident occurs once not regularly If Slovenia regularly attacked Croatia and lets say their troops came from the sea with heavy weapons blew up a military bases bridge killed 12 Croatian soldiers and took 8 hostages would you call it an incident  And how about Slovenia regularly attacked lets say since 1984 almost all cities of Croatia Would it look like an incident to you Or would it look like a battle or an attack

Dont get me wrong dear Korku tanrısı I believe youre writing amazing articles on battles and military and your contributions are wonderful for Wikipedia in all languages since all of them are translated in many languages and actually Im one of the translators of your articles to Turkish I believe that you are a very intelligent person yet on this case of NPOV I dont think youre right on the Incident issue This thing could be called at worst 21 October 2007 Hakkari PKK Battle which I called in Turkish yet it would be unjust to not call it an attack 

Some people who have military bases in another country which is controlled by anarchy who happens to be your neighbor is attacking your country quite heavily equipped with weapons is called an attack And as a military base and a country what you have against them is a battle

Im removing the NPOV tag if you dont find it vicious And I would love to discuss with you this issue and your knowledge on MiddleEast because I completely worship your articles privately on MSN or Email or even here

Cheers Onur
