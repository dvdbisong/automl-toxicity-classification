 References to Wikipedia English Italian or any other language are not considered reliable sources because as we see anyone can edit and change the information We need better references than that The other references are valid and Im not questioning them What I am questioning is the need for an article on the Landi State separate from the article on the House of Landi which already covers the topic of the Landi State in as much detail as is needed given the obscurity of the sources As for accusations that I have attacked the messenger please point out what I have said that is any way an ad hominem argument  ChatMeReadMe
