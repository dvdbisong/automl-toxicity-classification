The states did pass the laws yes Georgia passed a law against sodomy Its 1662 in the GA code you can go look it up However it would be incorrect to say Georgia criminalizes sodomy because in Powell v Georgia that law was ruled unconstitutional State codes reflect the will of the state legislature at the time and laws are not stricken from the books when ruled unconstitutional by courts
