Dear Lessheard vanU and to Wikipedia including all editors and administrators  Mr Wales   This is a very serious issue  We contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one  Yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedias own editors and administrators  As with Blackpearl14 who clearly believes that wikipedias polices dont apply to her and with other editors who uphold double standards   Then when challenged to the double standards including Blackpearl14s violation of wikipedias own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedias own written polices    Lessheard vanU had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a harassing the editor outright agreeing with Blackpearl14  Then in addition to IP address being blocked all talk  discussion are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers  Even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors  administrators all of this has been recorded including that Blackpearl14 having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page copies have been secure  that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her  These statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedias own written polices and purpose  Yet you have ignored that

As previously written in discussion per wikipedias own written polices but immediately deleted by Blackpearl14 and then sanctioned by  Lessheard vanU Blackpearll4  calls herself evidently Mrs Johnny Depp and Pirate lordess and such  She celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean for wikipedia   Why would someone devote so much time to 247 check the site and on these pages and then recklessly calls anyone who doesnt follow her bias views vandals attackers and such   Has her judgement become impaired   Her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean is very clear  That is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedias own written polices  Sorry but if one purchases products such as Pirates of the Caribbean posters toys and Walt Disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia  wikinews articles doesnt make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest   As recorded Blackpearl14s pages regarding this issue are one sided not neutral are bias in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the Walt Disney Company and Pirates of the Caribbean   Yes Pirates of the Caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the Walt Disney Company   Following wikipedias own written neutral policy entire articles would have to be deleted    Yet Blackpearl14 continues to violate Wikipedia polices and purpose  

Then with IPs being deliberately blocked and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to Pirates of the Caribbean following wikipedias own written polices editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason to delete those articles and ban the IP user   They use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts   Its a total lock out by the editors and administrators abusing their trust tools acting like a private monarchy   To date Blackpearl14s has proven she has ultimate control has repeatedly stated that is her purpose and had even sought to have the articles locked    Then you Lessheard vanU wrote that you dont want to lock these articles stating it goes against company policy but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as vandals and harassing the editors etc

Other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include SVTCobra and Whoville and Chris Mann   We have documented that they say one thing yet practice another   We have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers   We contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin
