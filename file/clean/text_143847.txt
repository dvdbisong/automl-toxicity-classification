Sci Rev dead 

Hi Ragesoss Whats happening on the SR article  Has Steve resigned  Given no response to my last series of criticisms various edits now required Seems to me revolution knocked out as it stands I cannot help reconstruct given I deny there was a revolution but only help with accurate historical and logical analysis of the nonrevolutionary developments in the centuries of interest The main problem of standard 17th century revolutionism for mechanics is essentially Duhems deconstruction of alleged key developments of the alleged 17th century scientific revolution into the 12th to 14th centuries that essentially still stands Perhaps details of that should replace the final literary criticism section you removed  Anyway articles surely in an appallingly confused nowhereland state at the moment Might be more educationally responsible to delete it entirely and put an article in construction notice Just an idea
