Theres no bright line here Like a lot of things you only know youve gone too far when youve gone too far For me telling me that wine is sold by the glass is one of the things that suggests that this article had crossed a line   not only is this information irrelevant its not even unique to this restaurant Perhaps things are different in your part of the country but in my experience every restaurant or bar that sells wine sells it by the glass I am all for having complete coverage but in my opinion this article reads like its written by someone who loves Pepes Pizza rather than someone who wants to inform others about Pepes Pizza
