Impact on Global Weather Patterns
This sounds like a bit of a stupid question but presumably if we start using a lot of wind energy then we are slowing down the movement and circulation of air in the atmosphere  How are we able to determine what the long term impact of this is  Recall that people expressing concerns about polluting the air and causing climate change were ridiculed when first proposed  How do we know that broadbased use of windbased power generation wont have dire longterm consequences  Those consequences to seem like they would be rapidly reversible however

Presumably a similar argument could be made about geothermal exhausting the heat within the Earth causing the tectonic action to cease but that seems a lot further off than windbased power generation having an impact
