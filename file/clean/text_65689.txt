 Ok I didnt say it read way better  I said it read better the way JVM had it which at least is grammatical  You apparently are very invested in the article being the way you want it despite at least two editors disagreeing with you so I give up Its really not that important to me  I think youre overemphasizing Italian flag cookies by separating them out but so be it  If I find sources or notable information Ill come back but for now hasta la vista  I have bigger fish to fry or cookies to bake or whatever  talk 0343
