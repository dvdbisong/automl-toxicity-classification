I believe in their Indoaryan Origin or Iranians of India 

Certainly from what ive seen read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran Afghanistan Pakistan and  just North India not south India yet i dont agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans indoeuropeans of iranian orign that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan JammuKashmir Guajarat and northwest regions basically to extend their culture

It is precisly the regions of the Sindhu River between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of Kashmir and Punjab the real home of Hinduism and indoaryans indoiranians

So what i mean is that if we talk about gypsy people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or AfghanIranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture

That is why many people feel i am one that roma people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians invading iranians where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites Huns and Greeks that came from Iran a fusion between them peoples id say 

Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan were there are many nomadic tribes

That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian south indian atleast but more Persian Iranian Kurdish Dardic Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas iraniangreek mixed with semitic traits M

Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS sun worshipers budda etc had as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan North India and Afghanistan What i mean to say is that they dresslookactand their music is more similar to people like the KurdsDardsGuajarsPashtusPothoharisKashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidianmongolian or austrolid indians

We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean iranian and others partly semiticiranianhungreekish people is how old ARYANS used to look like add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains 

The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned mostagebearded men that invaded their more asianaustroloid land

I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the Indoaryan of  orgin worriors of iranian origin that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan PothohariKashmir and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan RajputsJatts I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers

Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani PersianAfghaniPashtuPunjabiKashmiriRajasthaniHarayanaBrhamman cultures of indoeuropean or iraniscythiangreekish influence and language

Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania Hungary and Russia and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in CountryRock and RollHippie Music Fox TrotJazz and ofcourse latin american rythms like Rumba Salsa Bolero Tango Peruvian Valse Tondero Zamacueca Charchalera Milonga etc

It errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music entertainment circusacrobatsscene players and poets yet they mained t
