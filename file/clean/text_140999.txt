Thanks again for your attention  I filled out the information in the link you provided  Since this user has caused problems in the past I wanted to let you know in advance that I have taken some source material on another page that had expired citations condensed the information through careful edits and have spent hours making certain that all of the citations are valid and follow wikipedia guidelines  I just wanted to let you know this now in case another problem arises  Is there someone who I can get take a look at it or make appropriate changes so that the edit will not be blocked in case a user attempts to tear it down again
