Thank you for your suggestion that the number of reliable references from independent sources be increased I have added ten links and I think it has improved the article by more visibly documenting the scope of Dulvys work He has been interviewed and quoted in many media outlets including the New York Times and the BBC among others and his work has directly resulted in key policy changes Cathay Pacific Airlines banning unsustainable shark fin soup  the listing of Manta Ray gill rakers under CITES preventing their international trade Please let me know if this is what you had in mind and if the article can be improved further
