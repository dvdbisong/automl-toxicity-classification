I see I have a son your age he likes a lot of my old rock stuff Of course I must admit all music comes and goes with each generation Some songs remain classics though from all eras Sometimes music that is classic gets updated even into rap Im really more of a blues man myself thats why I like Brothers in Arms an ecletic blend of blues and rock I still cant figure out why PF Sloans Eve of Destruction sung by Barry McGuire hasnt resurrected in these times it was an anthem in the sixties This is my rifle there are many like it but this one is mine
