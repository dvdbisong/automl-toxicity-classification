RE Academics  

The below section under Academics as written

It should be noted that Irvington High School was once not a school with high academic achievements It has been said that the sole reason for Irvingtons recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School However while its obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvingtons test scores Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvingtons students A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvingtons academic achievement 

The above passaage is bias and speculative and should warrant a citation Student from Weibel Elementary School do not nor cannot feed directly into Irvington High School As is the case in any public school system in the United States unless a student is gifted elementry school students matriculate into a junior high or middle school than they move onto high school 

I recommend that this whole section be stricken I attended Irvington High School in the early 1990s and the differnece between the Weible neighborhood of Fremont and Irvington disctrict is very little Both are middle to upper middle class with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the presilcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont Peterbuilt Trail Mobile and Caterpillar in NewarkCa and Ford Motors in MilpitasCA resided in the Irvington district However as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970s and 1980s 

If this section should stay it should speak rather to the major reorganzation that took place in the middle to late 90s under the leadership of Principal Gaskill and VicePrincipal current Principal Pete Murchison check spelling As all of the accolades currently enjoyed by IHS were earned prior the the FUSD reorganization which placed the Weibel neighborhood  in the IHS service area This can easily be verifyed by crossing the early statewide and national honors Irvington High School earned in the mid1990s Thus debunking the assertion that Weibel neighborhood elemtry school students are responsible for the academic excellence of IHS
