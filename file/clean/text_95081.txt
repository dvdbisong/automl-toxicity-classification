WPWEIGHT has destroyed Wikipedias credibility for presenting the full picture I have seen it time and time again It is mainly used to suppress dissenting views from Government and MSM sources which are both bought and payed for by a minority of the 1 super rich The authentic way would have been to allow the minority view to be expressed and presented fully then simply explain why they are wrong point by point if there is really a case lets find out  and to mention where the professional consensus stands this moment but Wikipedia avoids that methodology and it makes it highly suspect of its motives I am not a supporter of RT but i am very happy that they broadcast everything the usual networks avoid and suppress at all cost
