Roy good questions Yes its actual thrust data from the Columbia mission STS107 However you cant directly measure thrust Rather its calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing even if engine thrust was constant which its not for the SRBs I include below some more info I was preparing to post

Because of the frequent confusion on this point I uploaded a thrusttime graph for the SRBs I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 28 million pounds each Each SSME produces 393000 pounds sea level thrust at 104 power level Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is 393000  3  2800000  2  6779 million pounds force or 3075 million kgf or 3016 MN Using these numbers the SRBs provide 826 of liftoff thrust 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 33 million pound thrust number some even erroneously adding sea level or liftoff thrust There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references dont state which they are using This is why references state SRB thrust from 265 million lbs probably sea level average thrust to 34 million lbs probably vacuum peak thrust

When comparing SRB thrust to say Saturn V F1 engine thrust you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type The F1 is not throttlable so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust At sea level this is 15298 million lbs per engine or 7649 million lbs thrust total By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time see chart Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6779 million pounds force or about 886 of the Saturn V

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T20 sec which is somewhat higher but that wouldnt be liftoff thrust
