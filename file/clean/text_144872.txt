As to you abusive nature i will let others make up their own minds after reading what you have writen on the talk page of the Cornish people page

So  aside from your insults are you saying that 50 million people in England are English The total population of England is English
Do you think it OK to use the total population of England as the indicator for the numbers of English in England If that is the case then for the Cornish people page the total population of Cornwall should be used for the numbers of Cornish

Secondly it is not my claim that there are 250000 Cornish people so what are you going on about All i have added of late is that a recent survey found that 44 of the Cornish populace thought themselves Cornish rather than British or English

according to a recent Morgan Stanley Bank survey 44 per cent of the inhabitants of Cornwall believe themselves to be Cornish rather than British or English 

Here are some more links so you can find out a bit more about what you are trying to comment on

In Cornwall 44 of those asked said they felt Cornish rather than English or British
