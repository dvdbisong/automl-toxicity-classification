Thank you so much   What do you recommend I do with this type of thing  For a while yesterday our buffer at the back end was down to seven hours which means risking a Siegenthalerlike gaffe helpful admins scrapped a few BLP howlers in a jiffy  Keeping up with the pace of article creation means I have enough time to add a category or two to articles who have none and sometimes wikify a bit  Occasionally the things Ive prodded look like theres an article waiting to be made about the subject just not enough in the material on the page to work from  Suggestions Charge
