This article is extremely clearly written and flows naturally from one section to the next In your history section there is typo that needs to be fixed decent should be descent It would add depth if you explained what the key findings of that publication regarding comparative neuroanatomy were The first sentence of the limitations section is a bit choppy and there are a few typos in the paragraph The asymmetry paragraph is really cool Is there any chance you can get a picture to illustrate the radiographic visualization techniques 

After reading your article it seems like a future research section would culminate the information presented throughout the article Overall it is a good article with solid facts in it I agree with Kniemeyer that more links and citations would further strengthen the article
