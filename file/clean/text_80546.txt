and I feel terribly sorry for having done such a crazy act Next time I step out of it and mind my own business I would like to apoligise to Floquenbeam for gloating like that and to everyone else This has been the first time Ive been blocked and Im not too upset about it I see I did something I shouldnt have done and Ill remember not to react like that ever again Offense is realized and I will never do something like that again To floquenbeam If I am now in one of your blackbooks and Ive now irritated you to the point where you cant stand me Ill stay away from you and Ill mind my own business I agree such a thing between me and Dave has escalated as of 2012 but I feel that it is wrong for blocking me for personal attacks because I havent made any hurl of vulgarity of any kind I only violated an interaction ban thats it  I see what I didnt wasnt clever If this block proposal passes and if Im unblocked I promise not to do it again and I will agree never to come near Dave1185s path ever again I tried to do the right thing but it didnt as we are all on the learning curve
