GOD 

According to the interview on allhiphopcom  published Dec 109 the last two projects of AZ are not his studio albums

ahh  you released Legendary early June of this yeartell me about that project

AZ That was just a mixtape as you can see I didnt promote no videosit was just a mixtape I put out The last album that I put out was Undeniable in 08 Right now Im working on Do or Die 2

Thats why I think both Legendary and GOD should not be considered his studio albums
