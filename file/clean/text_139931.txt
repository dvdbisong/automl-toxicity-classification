Astronautics Article in Further Reading Section

This reference is clearly worded so as to leave the reader with the impression that Singer believed in martians  Given that this particular reference is already discussed in detail in the body of the article why do we need a POV pushing second reference here especially in light of the level of effort it apparently requires to obtain a copy of the article in the first place  This second reference is clearly WPUNDUE even if we accept the validity of the reference above since this whole topic is clearly WPTRIVIA with respect to Singer in the first place

Im not going to revert it again but can someone please please just remove the further reading reference and let the content in the body above resolve this issue  I am minimally satisfied with the current description there  although I would obviously still like to see Singers direct statement on his lack of belief in martians included there
