ThanksNina for your patience and common senseIt is sad that Nishidami and Tom believe this article is merely a long running exercise of their megalomania
Take this recent gem from NishiThe most accurate information is not necessarily just what two most recent authors say here Wadsworth was summing up the state of the art for some 50 candidates including de Vere in 1958 Where does Nishi get off claiminga that Wordsworth ever read the Bibliotheca AntiStratfordianathe only source for the 49 authorship figureandb then followed its references to fifty candidatesmany confined to brief monographs orsometimesmere letters to the editorI knowI spent three years of my spare time at Columbia doing exactly what Nishidami fantastically asserts that Wordsworth did  Does Wordsworth even claim to have based his work on  the Bibliotheca  Certainly Nishi isntHe and Tom didnt even cite it in their bibliography and I gave them most of a year before weighing in on this
Nishidani has willfully invented numerous discussions involving conspiracy theory in places where it would have been physically impossible to print such and which he certainly
never attempted to readApologizeNishiconfession is good for the soulAnd promise us you are going to stop Tendentiously Editing  2323 10
