Chigger range 

There should be a section on which areas of the world are plagued by chiggers and which arent  I know here in the US they are prevalent in the hot and humid parts of the country  mostly in the south east the south and the midwest and theyre not present in northern areas or the high mountains and deserts of the west  I dont think the west coast has much of a chigger problem either

Anyhow  quite awful animals  right up there with ticks as some of the worst
