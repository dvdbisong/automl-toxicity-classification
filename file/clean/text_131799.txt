Hello anonymous user in this edit 11 June 2014 you removed the name Drepanodon Leidy 1861 from the synonymy of Mosasaurus stating in the summary that Drepanodon is a synonym of the cave bear You did not mention a source for this and you might be right but first of all you did not show you realized there are two taxa named Drepanodon The first one is Drepanodon Nesti 1826 which was classified as a member of the Felidae when published the second one is the junior homonym Drepanodon Leidy 1861 the one that is listed in the synonymy of Mosasaurus As you did not mention any justification for your edit I restored the name Drepanodon Leidy to the synonymy of Mosasaurus An extra reason for me to do this was that it would be far more likely for the older name given to the remains of a carnivore to apparently represent another species of carnivore than it would be for a name given to saurian remains Confusion of the names was what most likely happened here as far as I can see

In the same edit you removed the name M copeanus Marsh 1869 from the list of invalid or dubious species because the name had been synonymized with Plioplatecarpus depressus The idea of this list is to summarize names that have been associated with the generic name Mosasaurus but are no longer recognized as valid species in that genus If such a name is eventually synonymized with a taxon in another genus then just removing it from the list is removing information On the other hand adding the name for which it is now considered a synonym gives extra information Especially if someone stumbles upon a name in Mosasaurus somewhere and wants to find out more about it and so decides to look up Mosasaurus in the encyclopedia it would be most helpful when the accepted name is provided

One last thing am I right in suspecting you to be the same user as  another user with a keen interest in saurians but lacking that extra bit of skills in the field of taxonomy Â klaas
