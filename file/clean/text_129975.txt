entry I concede I do not have the strength patience to fight this alone or even in doubles Your approach to this issue as well as s are useful in reminding us of the selfevident fact that the information in this online encyclopaedia is only as good as its contributors and editors input Avast ye strudels  
More commentary on editors  Enlightening  My sympathies for your professed poor imagination Regards   
What you perceive as commentary on editors ie as something personal is criticism of how specific editors approach and have approached in the recent past a specific issue on a specific article That is exactly what this is all  about and no more although itd be understandable if you want to make it abt something else Because what you are doing is an attempt to deflect the argument rather than address it And the argument is solely about restoring some semblance of encyclopaedic insight into a biography article s attempt to do so and the duo once again blanketing of anything remotely besmirching the profile of the articles subject Talk about being passionate In case you feel like being on point again sometime in the future Id advice you to start by enlightening us about the reasons for your  violation of one of the fundamental principles of Wikipedia editing The rest is well crafted noise  
But really  enough about you  The Gnome
Yes enough  your commentary on editors instead of their specific edits is not productive and is frowned upon by the very guideline you just cited  As for a violation to which you allude could you please provide a diff so that I may address it Regards   

 RfC Superhead nickname and porn video references 

References to Karrine Steffans being featured in a porn video and use of the nickname Superhead have been inconclusively discussed on the basis of WPBLP guidelines The controversy is covered in sources such as NY Daily News which quotes Steffan and the CBS business network The Superhead nickname is confirmed by Steffans in a direct interview Opinions particularly on this specific interpretation of WPBLP and WPNOTCENSORED are welcome in order to resolve this discussion which has been running for over a year   

Really Fæ is this a brief neutral statement of the issue that RfC requires emphasis in original   TalkStalk 
Feel free to rewrite it Im not enamoured with it I thought it was long but factual   
Trimmed it down in particular cutting the explanation    
Comment  Id be willing to help out but I need clarification on the precise issue  does the sourcing issue revolve around whether or not she uses the nickname Superhead  Or whether or not she made an adult video    
There are multiple issues but each have failed to meet the high quality sourcing requirements required by WPBLP  We
