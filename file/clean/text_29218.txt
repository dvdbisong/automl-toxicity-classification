Well investigating was exactly what was written There was nothing else implied in this other than that nor was there anything implied in the NY Times or ABC ciations that were used for verifiability As far as investigating a famous person goes all I can say is that Al Gore isnt just some random famous person He is a former Vice President of the United States of America and if we remember correctly he came within a few hundred Dade County votes of becoming the President of the United States of America Then let us remember that this isnt a normal Beverly Hills investigation into drunk driving or spousal abuse This is an investigation of a felony that carries with it lots and lots of jail time No probation for this offense You just cant compare it to what goes on in Hollywood
