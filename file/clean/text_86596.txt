Removed the Westboro Baptist Church subsection This group protests countless groups Funerals for soldiers Matthew Shepards funeral and subsequent productions of the Laramie Project Lady Gaga concerts federal courthouses the US Holocaust Museum and Memorial Jewish community centers Papal visits etc In most cases with the exception of protests targeting Jewish groups the message of the protests is that Americans are too accepting of LGBT people This is even their message when protesting soldiers funerals A reference to Westboro in every entry where they have protested is simply not noteworthy The fact that Westboro protested the LDS church once doesnt really tell us anything about the church or its teaching on homosexuality That said it could probably be noteworthy to add info to the Westboro Baptist entry regarding the protest of the Hinckley funeral
