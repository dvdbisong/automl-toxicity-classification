Anachronisms and Balance
I have noticed that this section and most of the article is written in a very unbalanced way This must be a favorite editing place for critics of the Book of Mormon Archaeologists in general probably have no interest in the Book of Mormon unless they are funded by people interested in the book of mormon or critics
Since this article is here we need to try to present an article that shows all sides in a meaningful way
Be curious not judgmental   

As I read through the article there is incredible redundancy This article needs to focus on the archaeology not statements I think that is politics different section  
Archaeologists in general probably have no interest in the Book of Mormon unless they are funded by people interested in the book of mormon or critics Be careful when you make a statement like that Have you read Coes article in Dialogue I think that is a much better place to get an idea of what Archaeologists in general think about the Book of Mormon and a good overview of the research that has been done on the topic
