Hi you deleted three links that I inserted  an account of the runners high on Endorphins and a link to an academic paper directly connected to Transcendentalism and Romantic poetry title On Being God I cannot understand why these would be inappropriate They are not promoting anyone or selling anything merely providing a further resource for the topic in question 

Please reappraise your deletion

Thanks
