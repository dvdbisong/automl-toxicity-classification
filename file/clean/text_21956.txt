Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions 

I am not and was never looking to start trouble all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references

The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on

My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a CrownSlam

You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so

On 8406 JBL said he was a Slam winner  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat

It was said that no outside source has verified this but no one in WWE has disputed JBLs claim either

Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal

When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW the IC and US Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw IC and Smackdown US

PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a World Title and their word is law here on Wikipedia

They also have always maintained that the IC and US Championships are of equal value and of equal standing

As I have said before I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact based on logic and references

JBL PWI and many other wiki users have backed up this definition Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page

All I ask is my contribution be allowed to stand as I respectfully feel that I am in the right on this one

Thank you for your time
