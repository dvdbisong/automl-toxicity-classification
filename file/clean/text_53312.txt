Thanks 

Sorry about the unnecessary extra reversion at the siege articleI was working from a list of editor contributions and failed to realize that there was a substantial time gap between the previous edits and the newer ones I only noticed it now because I was going through my own contributions list and suddenly saw a big negative number attached to one of my edits Thank you for fixing my mistake ã‚ˆ
