Use of CIP dimensions instead of SAAMI dimensions
Since this is a North American cartridge it is more germane to use SAAMI dimensions  The CIP Î”L issue though it exists is again not germane to the discussion of this cartridge at least to my knowledge is not chambered in firearm action types that are affected by this issue  Use SAAMI dimensions for cartridges originating from Canada and the United States CIP for cartridges originating in Austria Belgium Chile Czech Republic Finland France Germany Hungary Italy Russia Slovakia Spain and the UK Since most firearm sales are make in SAAMI countries the use of SAAMI recommendations at least for cartridges originating in the US and Canada should be the convention Since Canada and the US are common law countries the SAAMI recommendation carry the force of law without the need to stipulate by enacted law This de facto standard has be adjudicated in court in Canada and the US Since CIP is by governed and enforced by treaty to which they are not party to Canada and the United States do not recognize CIP mandates or recommendations with some exception
