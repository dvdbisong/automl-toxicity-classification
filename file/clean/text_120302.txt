WP is not a WPBATTLEGROUND Rather than argue with me why not demonstrate your case by making well founded arguments based on RS for which consensus can be established If the consensus is to change the current wording then that is fine By the way your first line above is very close to a personal attack by addressing my state of mind rather than my edits For the wikipedia definition of consensus which includes things to do with policy and guidelines such as NPOV undue and fringe see WPCONSENSUS If you want to discuss my understanding with me please do it on my talk page rather than disrupting this page thanks  chat
