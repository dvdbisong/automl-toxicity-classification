Ref to Great Ape rights law in Ethics
I agree with Crum375 A major issue is that the laws on animal testing by representative governments can be used as a metric of the majority ethics on animal testing The lead of the ethics section puts forth the majority view on ethics This caveat is an important exception Most of the world does not perform invasive testing on Great Apes or allow itm OTOH I thought Crum375s revert was an excessive use of reversion when simply correcting the reference would have been adequate and I further disagree that the reference does not support the statement
