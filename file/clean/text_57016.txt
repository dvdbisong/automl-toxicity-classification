Stub tags after categories please 

Hi Please add stub tags after the categories in an article not before as you did for Protest camp  it makes life just a little easier for people doing stubsorting See WPSTUB which says By convention this is placed at the end of the article after the External links section any navigation templates and the category tags so that the stub category will appear last They go in front of any interwiki links but after everything else Thanks
