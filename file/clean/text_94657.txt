So CCBYSA content cant be included in anything licensed under the GFDL and GFDL content cant be included in anything licensed under CCBYSA including Wikipedia  I had been assuming that since Wikipedia was previously under GFDL and switched to CCBYSA the latter was backwardcompatible with the former  Apparently that was not the case but rather some kind of special temporary exemption was createdIm not at all clear on how that would be possible but then Im not a lawyer  In fact I now see under my edit box that it says you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CCBYSA 30 License and the GFDL emphasis added  Im not even sure what kind of exemption could even in principle make it possible to license content under two mutually exclusive licenses simultaneously  
In any case  I doubt that the HydrogenAudio folks would be interested in suing the Wikimedia Foundation but apparently if they wanted Wikipedia to be able to reuse their content theyd have to change their license  Since theyre a wiki too though Im not sure how they could do that lacking whatever special mojo Wikipedia used in 2009  Lucky for me I dont care enough to waste any more time on this but I kind of wish someone would fix it
