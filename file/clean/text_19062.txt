meat from dogs or canids 

Canines is ambiguous  And the link did not help resolve it  Does it mean meat from only dogs or wolves and foxes and such as well  Because Canine is a common synonym not only for dog but also for Canid  So maybe the first sentence could still use some work but I dont think dog meat refers to meat from canines is the answer
