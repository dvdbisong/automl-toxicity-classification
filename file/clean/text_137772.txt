Hello and welcome to Wikipedia

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome but I noticed your username and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedias username policy After you look over that policy could we discuss that concern here

Id appreciate learning your own views for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern

You have several options freely available to you
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here I can stop worrying about it
 If the two of us cant agree here we can ask for help through Wikipedias dispute resolution process such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username Visit WikipediaChanging username and follow the guidelines there
