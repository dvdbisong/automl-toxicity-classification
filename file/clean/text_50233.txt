Thats an excellent point though I would counter that in the case of Pink Floyd the vocals are samples and in Anesthesia the voice comes before the song starts like an artifact from the recording process Finally in neither case are lyrics credited in the album sleeve Again I understand that this seems to be nit picking I just feel its important to note that the band chose to include lyrics credited to their recently dead band mate in what would have otherwise been a instrumental I think the way its written now looks great and is again a good compromise Someone else please share their thoughts on that
