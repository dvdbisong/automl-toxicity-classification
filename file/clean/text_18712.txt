Hehe Im still blocked so I had to reply here   Jaranda I just really want you to know that I wasnt stalking you or anything like that I really wasnt trying to harass you  It was lack of judgment on my part  Perhaps I shouldve backed off but I still think it was unfair  I mean after the edit to well I cant remember the page the one after Eric Gagne I was warned by another user not to do what I was doing even though I wasnt intentionally  I went to respond to him and I saw I was blocked  Im not saying that what I was doing was right but I dont think I shouldve been blocked if I didnt do anything wrong after I was warned  If I continued then of course I would be blocked and Id agree with that but the way it was I dont think shouldve resulted in a block

As far as becoming a future admin Ive pondered in the past if Id be willing to go through that at some point in the future and Im really not sure if Id want to  It would be an honor if I were an admin but thats a lot of responsibility and Im not sure that Im the right person for that  And with my new philosophy I explained it in my past post Id have to take more responsibility than at this point of my editing career Im willing to take  Much later in the future I might change my opinion  But Ive gotten into several disputes in the past and Im trying to change my entire philosophy to negate all the problems Ive caused in the past  Having been blocked for the first time ever ironically during the time that my friend  was blocked adminship isnt something that Im going to even consider about considering about considering at this time  But perhaps some mentoring would help me become a better editor and I wouldnt mind any assistance should you wish to provide some for me Jaranda  Thank you very much  talk
