Regarding the google rankings I dont see how you can divorce the Cork City hits from the Cork County hits  Which is a very relevant distinction  On whatlinkshere there are 1100 inlinks to city and 800 to county pretty close  If there were no other convention then Cork would already be a disambiguation page even without cork material to contend with  However the overriding convention appears to be Wikipedia talkManual of Style Irelandrelated articlesDisambiguation of locations in Ireland
Where a town and county have the same name the county article should be named as County Countyname and the town should be located at Countytownname if no further disambiguation is needed For example Sligo and County Sligo
Its only a talkpage suggestion but absent anything stronger its unexceptionable  However throw cork material back into the mix and its clear that its not a contest between material and city its a contest between material city and county  To me is a clear case where disambiguation is required as the only reason city is preferred to county is a very obscure and largely arbiitratry Wikipedia convention
