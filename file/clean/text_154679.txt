Edit request to MOS standard 

WPEUPHEMISM states The word died is neutral and accurate avoid euphemisms such as passed away The Critical reception section on this article reads The Jungle Book received an outpouring of positive reviews upon release undoubtedly influenced by a nostalgic reaction to the passing of Disney The wording needs be changed to read the death of Disney in accordance with MOS standards as passing does sound silly 82825213
