List of Mad Magazine issues 

Hi  Thanks for your recent improvement to this article Collectonians point is surely that keeping a list article with the combined tables of contents of all the issues is an honor that we accord to very few magazines I personally believe that its justified in the case of Mad because famous publications deserve more coverage than obscure ones Irrespective of Collectonians particular viewpoint a highquality list article with lots of references is easier to defend against future requests for its deletion I havent studied this one enough to know how it could be improved but I think your new intro is a step in the right direction I hope to post again on the Talk but havent had the time yet 

You are one the of the people who I was hoping to get the attention of because I think only someone familiar with the magazine would have good ideas for how to improve this article  I read the magazine when I was a kid but have no idea of how to explain its cultural significance 

I notice that Mad magazine is also tagged for needing inline citations and I sympathize with that tag We need to get the help of some Mad aficionados who are willing to dig up references
