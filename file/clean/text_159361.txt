I did a copy edit of the article and among other thing I put the section back in  After reading the Ethnic Group page I felt that the term could apply although this decision is based upon my limited knowledge of the terms Flemish and Walloon I am after all not Belgian  In any case if the phrase Ethnic Group is inappropriate simply replace the term with a better one as the data is pertinent to the article
