Can you check on something  weird 
 You deleted this page today and rightly so but somehow it was on my watchlist after deletion The only reason I can see that happening is that a page was moved to this title and then deleted Can you check the deleted articles history and see if that is the case I dont immediately notice any other article on my watchlist missing but I probably wouldnt notice it immediately Its just really weird and it doesnt make sense to me Thanks for taking a look into it        0524 UTC  17 Mar 08
