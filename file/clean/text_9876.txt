As much as human rights and ethnic rights should be respected spray painting every possible detail of unverifiable information on the Rohingya and getting around the verification by claiming that the information was destroyed by an interested party  are not valid reasons for having a list of villages where a certain group of people live There is already a lot of articles on the Arakanese people and state that have no concern of the Rohingya but include them for the sake of brotherly respect  this is pushing the line a bit far Rohingyas should be treated fairly  I do not contest that But articles like this one  are pure selfpitying and clutters Wikipedia with absolutely useless information I wonder when will somebody change the name of the article on BurmaMyanmar on wiki to Country where the Rohingya are Persecuted
Rather a brief mention of where the Rohingyas reside should be placed if desired on the main article on Rakhine state  albeit short and concise not dump an entire list of names copied directly from some publication
With all due respect this article should be deleted
