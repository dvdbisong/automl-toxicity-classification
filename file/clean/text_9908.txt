Inconsistencies  
There are two inconsistencies At one paragraph the article claim the fulgurites can reach a length of 15 meters implying there have been one found with that length Further down the article I read the longest one found is around 5 meters Which one should it be

Fulgurites have often deep penetrations sometimes appearing up to 15 meters 50 feet below the lightningstruck surface

The longest fulgurite found is approximately 49 to 5 meters 17 feet in length and was found in northern Florida USA
