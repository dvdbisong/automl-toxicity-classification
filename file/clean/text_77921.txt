your signature 

BTW Ive noticed that your signature does not link to your user or talk pages I suspect youve customized it to be this way WikipediaSIGInternal links says Signatures must include at least one internal link to your user page user talk page or contributions page this allows other editors easy access to your talk page and contributions log The lack of such a link is widely viewed as obstructive

Let me know if you need help fixing this
