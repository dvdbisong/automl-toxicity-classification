You guys just dont get it  Your bad behavior drives other editors off the site who then become enemies  Editors like Brangifer and Verbal are troublemakers who go around attacking articles and offending other editors who are trying to contribute their knowledge  Neither of them has a collaborative attitude  They barrel into an article with guns blazing and wonder why people end up hating them and cant assume good faith  Editors who spend all day every day on the site as if it were a fulltime job are just mucking things up for editors who are trying to be productive  Once an editor has exhausted his knowledge any further contribution he makes is of little value  It is the Brangifers and Verbals on the site who are initiating the editwars
