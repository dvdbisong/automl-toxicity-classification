Ive just skimmed this drivel  I really dont have much time for it  and noticed comments by CLIFTONIAN I need to apologize to this man 

I got out of Pattani towards the end of Ramadam and spent a few days in Singapore Ramadam this year in Pattani was tough Google Pattani Bomb to see what I mean and perhaps look at the IMAGES too I got back to Pattani on Friday the start of HARI RAYA and had a few drinks We all did This was when I wrote my final comments 

Yep  what I did was wrong I had no right to disrupt CLIFTONIANs review Being slightly drunk is not an excuse Ive checked the guys profile page and would like to say that I have immense respect for the Israeli armed forces I hope the guy is safer outside Tel Aviv than we are here in Pattani
