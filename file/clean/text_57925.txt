Not similar to racial purity 

Im having difficulty seeing the dissimilarity between those who dont like miscegenation because they are worried about Aryans becoming Jewish and those who dont like miscegeneation because they are worried about Jews becoming goyim Whatever the rights and wrongs of the views they certainly do seem very similar If you are arguing that in one case the distinction is racial and in the other ethnic okay thats reasonable but you should note that racial and ethnic are distinctions based on the POVs in question rather than something neutral that simply attaches to the distinction
