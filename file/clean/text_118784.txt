Why Two Pages 

Now Im not an authority such as people here claim to be I dont hold any PhDs nor do I feel I posses a body of knowledge that is very likely to dismissinnocent guesses or fractal knowledge  I have however spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan specifically Almaty That is the name I always hear people use  Almaty The Russians however still call it AlmaAta For example I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty All the people I met in Almaty however say Almaty When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city it is also written as Алматы Almaty 

From my experience only the Russians continue the use of AlmaAta As another example the train station in Moscow says АлмаАта AlmaAta However it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod or Nizhny for short  I cant recall actually hearing Gorki used beyond the train station

Also Its not just the Kazakh government who uses that name  its a lot of people Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty they sometimes mention the Soviet AlmaAta much like Bishkek is the Soviet Frunze 

As for using the scientificscholarlyapproved approach for naming Wikipedia doesnt do that as mentioned above See the scientific or academic method for writing the offical name of the country  Қазақстан  is actually Qazaqstan the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English There area few academic books do that look at works from Indiana University for example but outside of these small circles people by and large write Kazakhstan with a K   including Wikipedia If people say we should use AlmaAta because its the correct name as dictated by academics why no Qazaqstan  

Anyway my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles Almaty and AlmaAta I think there should only be one since regardless of the name it is still the same place All the pictures and information should be seen together on one page They should be merged 

Oh one more thing I just went to Google and looked up Алматы Almaty  4270000 hits I then looked up АлмаАта AlmaAta  only 1160000
