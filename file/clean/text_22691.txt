Re reply at Jimbo 

Youre right here about condoned by Jimbo a regular victim of rudeness I think hes too soft and not tough enough and that sets the examples for every one else across the whole site and ultimately it results in people being rude and aggressive and no one being willing to do anything about it because the founder doesnt care or think its that important I gave the links out before on Jimbos page but heres one person who should have been blocked indef That whole block log is a joke So he continues today making personal attacks rude and aggressive comments  and hes allowed to roam free  all because the founder isnt tough enough In addition to that ofcourse other users  and so on In trying to tolerate dissident voices as you said were now in a situation where other editors have to take in abuse from trolls who are well aware of the power they command here  talkcontribs
