Re Veronika Zemanova article edits You wrote
Unfortunately the external links you are trying to add are not appropriate for Wikipedia One is to a repository of images compiled by a fan community The community does not hold the copyright to these images thus making them not appropriate The second is a link to a pay site soliciting our readers for membership Also not appropriate Please read up on our guidelines for external links and spam AniMate 

I respond what I objected to was that both you and Damiensrf arbitrarily made deletions without sufficient or accurate explanations To classify the External Links I contributed as SPAM was incredibly mistaken Upon further consideration I agreed that the Actiongirlscom link stressed product over information and was just about to remove it WITH THAT EXPLANATION when you struck in On the other hand I do think the Fans Community Collection website Link was an ESSENTIAL photoreference guide to Veronikas work as a model And I dont at all buy your copyright concerns re the latter either It is a welldocumented website in which neither Veronikas photos nor videos can be downloaded for commercial OR noncommercial gain So why on earth do you object Cmon AniMate put THAT Link back 12 November 2009
