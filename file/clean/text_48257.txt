states under the direct control of the larger federal sovereign  

Also if you look at the US Constitution both the Preamble and Article II repeatedly and consistently refer to the United States of America  From the surrounding wording it is clear that the Founders were referring to a single legal entity and believed they were constituting such an entity  So the United States of America is the legal name of the federal government  There are also many sections in the United States Code which refer to the United States of America

 They are referred to in both the Constitution and other documents as the United States because before 1787 they were semiindependent  This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency engaged in trade wars with each other refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line etc into a Union hence how they became the United  Up until the Civil War especially in the South is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didnt agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s etc  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics and some Kingdoms  If the states hadnt come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the Articles of Confederation from 1775 most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 if not sooner and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states which who knows if there would even be 50  Your conceptualization of interstate relations leading up to the 1787 constitution is limited  A few delegates getting miffed would have changed the last three centuries of world history in ways we can hardly imagine  2101 18 Feb 2005 UTC

I hold a bachelors degree in history from the most prestigious public university in the United States  I am wellaware of all of the facts you just mentioned especially the delicate fragility of the Union throughout its first century  I am also familiar with all the diverse whatif scenarios  

I do not have all day to write on talk pages  I did not think it was necessary to rehash the convoluted details of two centuries of American history just to explain how we got to our present pigpen of legal fictions and political realities  But thanks for doing that for me  

When I said wording above I was referring to the consistent use of the definite article the rather than the plural demonstrative adjective these in the Constitution  But you did clarify something I neglected the task of explaining why the Constitution has to refer to states which are united as opposed to say the United State

 Republicans and religious Jews 

Excuse me  In the Politics section the following sentence appears

The Republicans generally receive more funding and support from business groups religious Christians and Jews and rural Americans while the Democratic party receives more support from labor unions and minority ethnic groups

In the history  sliced out the phrase and Jews and then  promptly reverted it  Now Im a little confused  Historically when Jews are considered as a voting bloc they tend to lean Democratic  However this analysis has always considered Jews as a single ethnic class and not separated out religious Jews from nonreligious Jews  Therefore my question

Does anyone have evidence that religious Jews tend to vote Republican or Democratic
