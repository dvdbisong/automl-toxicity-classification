Commons Admin Noticeboard beginning 322 Part II 
 Threerevert rule and David Shankbone 

Hey Herby does the Threerevert rule from WP apply here at Commons  I see that editor David Shankbone has reverted a comment on WJBscribes talkpage three times in less than twentyfour hours   

Should this incident be reported at COMAN COMANA or COMANV

Please advise  Thank you Honeyoops I mean Herby

Stop the trolling or I will block you  3 RR does not apply on Commons nor would it ever to such edits  talk thyme 

 
Pity  I thought Id ask you Hon since you have experience here and at WP where youre an Admin open to recall  

What about the actions of WJBscribe in this matter  Should I report his presiding over COI and BLP violations at Michael Lucas director to any or all of the forums listed above or others or both

BTW is the term trolling Wikispeak for followup

Blocked for two hours  talk to me 

Blocked Yeah right  ABF I want Herbys reply  go block something else
How to block this IP without blocking all of north New Jersey
Herby and ABF Wikipedia found a way to block this IP range without blocking the entire range  If you look at this thread on ANI the message by Wknight tells you the range to block to at least make it more of a pain for the person to have to continually reset their modem until they find an open protocol  I suggest we do that for about a month here   

Whizkids Herby and ABF apparently that does not work as Im here and I have been there too

David if only you could stay off substances for about a month how long has it been since youve been without for a month since you started and undergo psychiatric help in the same period to start  David C Miller you have been found out  I know who you are and I know what youve done  and youre not getting away with it The preceding unsigned comment was added by  talk  contribs at 1406 22 Mar 2008 UTC

In general trolls are to be ignored as far as I am concerned  I have a life  you may wish to get one yourself I guess In passing you are of course welcome to report anyone you like anywhere you wish to might be amusing I suppose  talk thyme 
Herby its troubling that you find amusement in somebody wanting to report possible Admin vios of BLP and COI 
My involvement on Wikipedia is very limited  Take issues you have there to whatever page you want there  You probably know your way around better than me  talk thyme 
Youre right I probably do given that I have successfully edited despite amateurish blocks while you have unsuccessfully evaded recall there  Thats why youre here right  No matter  Luck you
Hey Herby  it did work on WP  but if it doesnt that IP range may not be as active on Commons as it is on WP and so you may just want to block the whole range  Wikinews is prepared to do so as well  Obviously WP has other considerations  The IP editor has become a running joke in the IRC c
