Yes you are correct I do beleive that the Arbitration process in Wikipedia is crap The vast majority of cases these days are just one editor or a group of editors trying to force their way on others It is no longer about doing the right thing for the project Regarding helping out at AE I do wholeheartedly agree it would be good for more admins to get involved and that is true of many areas of WP not just AE Part of the problem is that most admins are given the toolset because they keep their heads down and do not get involved in these areas Those that do much like myself are too untrustworthy or lack the proper temperment to be admins So its a never ending self perpetuating cycle of promoting the sheep to guard against the wolf Also more than one editor and admin alike has voiced that they feel that you dont listen to comments at AE and largely do what you want so why would they help out
