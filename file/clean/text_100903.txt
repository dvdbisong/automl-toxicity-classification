Indeed I noticed a strange phenomenon in Russia over all the birth rates ARE growing 121 in 2008 vs 124 in 2009 115 in 2007 vs 121 in 2008 at the end of each of those years they went down slightly 125  124 in 2009 for example Ill have to research this more to really see why this is But if I had to say now Id say it is because of the New Year and Orthodox Christmas as well as Muslim Kurban Bairam celebrations November December January is when everyone is celebrating and partying Not a lot of people are conceiving during this time
