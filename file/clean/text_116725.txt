Beer Categories 

It has been suggested by UserBrianSmithson that the Beer and brewery categories should be renamed The proposal has been supported by UserSyrthiss and supported and expanded by myself The notion is that the regional categories should follow the format of Beer and breweries in Africa EuropeAsiaNorth AmericaSouth AmericaOceania Brewers and breweries could also be renamed Beer and breweries by region And all the countries should also be renamed and merged if needed as for example Beer and breweries of Germany Beer and breweries of Britain Beer and breweries of Poland The word in each case would be beer rather than beers to allow for general articles on beer culture in each region as well as individual beers
