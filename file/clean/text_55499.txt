I hope you take this time to reflect upon why it has happened You work is vital to the project as vital as that of any active editor But even the best work can be undone by not understanding the need for civility Also try to understand that ultimately all policies are irrelevant there is only building an encyclopedia Protecting the project from legal action in terms of copyright cannot be done at the expense of building relevant content however uninteresting it is to you personally244711141
