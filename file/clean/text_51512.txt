So why the heck did you whoever change the credits back to what it was

Why is Shigeru Miyamoto listed all the way under the directors If youre going to not give him any credit for directing then at least put his name first as it is the order it appeared in the OFFICIAL CREDITS 

Also why the hell is someone constantly scared if I add more information on the development on Ocarina of Time I think people who are looking for info would appreciate being as specific as possible Dont change my edits this time especially if you think theyre trivial
