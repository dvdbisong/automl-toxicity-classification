Im willing to take criticism for my edits and Im willing to back down if Im wrong My statement was in good faith but its also true that I made the statement on my own authority without citing a source However my statement was really no more weaselly than the statement it was intended to answer So Ive reverted to my last version because I have criticisms of ImpuMozhis edits that I think are valid but removed both of the weasel statements because I concede that your criticism of some of my wording is valid If you believe that I was impolite or uncivil to ImpuMozhi or anyone else then please let me know what I did wrong so that I may tender my apology
