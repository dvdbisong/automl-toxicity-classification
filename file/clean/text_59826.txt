Both the BBC and ABC get things wrong If on checking specific information from a usually reliable source is found to be incorrect or unreliable it cant be somehow made correct or reliable by pointing to the track record of the media outlet If something is incorrect its incorrect That 70 figure seems way too high and Id like to see some polling figures from a reliable source such as Gallop or Morgan rather than an unspecified source which could well be an internet or radio poll Incidentally I must congratulate Matilda on her foresight in storing this material for five years judging by the access date
