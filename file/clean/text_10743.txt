VOTE NOW Should Peggy Mitchell be on the Fictional erotic dancers category 

It has been revealed during Peggys political campaign that she was a pole dancer for the 60s gangland  Everyone in Walford found out about this part of her past and Peggy gradually became open towards it and used it in her speech at The Vic

I find it absolutely ludicrous that people wont accept her as a fictional erotic dancer however I am given the power to anyone so it could be a democratic poll  Remember Peggys pole dancing photo was on the Walford Gazette and she even put a photograph of this in her pub

Please consider carefully about this

Yours sincerely
