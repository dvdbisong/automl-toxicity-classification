Re Believein deletion Hi  this page is the only thing Ive ever written for Wikipedia which I did because my charity used them and found the concept unique and helpful Now its been deleted for advertising though it was never meant to be such And it seems far less promotional than the pages which link to it Is there anything I can do in terms of style and format that could help to see it included again Many thanks   Bermondsey Boys
