Crash and Cortex not together enough 

It may just be me but did anyone feel that Crash and Cortex were not played together enough in the game Usually at some points Cortex leaves Crash with that Come along or This way line It seem to me that the game mostly has you play as Crash as opposed to Crash and Cortex together because isnt that the whole point of the game You couldnt even play as both of them in the final level  BJ
