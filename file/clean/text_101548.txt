After edit conflict  including with myself Doh
The way your reply is phrased leads me to wonder  but never mind this could end up as an infinite regression  Shall we just say the inferences you draw from my statement are not the ones I recognise as my intent or as their actual implication so you making a corresponding complaint seems somewhat ironic  You also dont address my question about notification at all
My statement was about a JSs actual notability being predominantly in the area of Creationism rather than chess and certain versions of the article veering away from this reality and b the motivation of that editor indeed every editor at least to that point to be writing about him at all  Thats pretty clearly related to his significance as a creationist and not some interest in writing about about chess more generally  An implication of a pretext to promote a creationist agenda does not appear to correlate with what I said at all  What I had in mind was more increasing similarity to dustjacket prose and AA being reluctsnt to acknowledge this about his relative notabilities
Your false comparison is likewise nothing like any I was making  JS is very notable as a Creationist being a bucketloadselling author on such topics as well as an internet celeb which certainly merits an article which in turn requires some discussion of his prowess  and distinctly lesser notability  as a chess player  Hes not so notable as a chess player that he would ordinarily have an article purely on him as such and I see no reason to include every possible fact about him as a chess player out of proportion to actual notability
At any rate if your evidence on the RFAr page stands as is I shall feel compelled to respond to dispute your assertions about my comment  I was rather hoping to keep out of the whole mess personally going as it largely does to does privacy policy completely trump autobiography concerns about which I have opinions but little direct involvement  Id like to ask you to withdraw them or at least to rephrase
