Concerns about Arvanites as Albanian origin group is not a trolling 

Trolling refers to deliberate and intentional attempts to disrupt the usability of Wikipedia for its editors administrators developers and other people who work to create content for and help run Wikipedia Trolling is deliberate violation of the implicit rules of Internet social spaces It necessarily involves a value judgment made by one user about the value of anothers contribution   My action and my opinion has nothing to do with trolling if this is a reasons for you to delete what I write this is something else The article I think has to express more extensive work and different background contributors then simple group of usual users I encourage people with Arvanitic origin and  Albanians to participate in discussions therefore this article will be much more accurate and fare from bias Dodona
