Regarding workstations servers and mainframes 

I believe that workstations and servers are classes of computers not sizes

For example consider the IBM Power 595 It is a server is it not From the page IBM seems to think so and it certainly fits the definition of a server with that being a computer that provides a services to clients Now consider the IBM Power 520 This too is a server is it  not IBM thinks so and it fits the definition

However the Power 595 is not a desktop It is nowhere near a desktop It is a rackmount IBMspeak framemount server as evidenced by its dimensions 2014 cm x 775 cm x 1806 cm and weight 1552 kg I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea a cookie

Now the Power 520 is not a rackmount server It is nowhere near a rackmount server It is a deskside server as evidenced by its dimensions 540 mm x 182328 mm x 628 mm and weight 408 kg I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a topoftheline rackmount server a cookie

Two very different machines both in hardware and form factor but they are still both classed as a server Clearly as evidenced by this servers can be in many form factors A server can be a desktop but it is not exclusively a desktop How the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is A server can also be a rackmount a tower a blade a deskside and a pedestal to name a few

Workstations also come in more form factors than just desktop Many servers are desktops as in horizontal and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk the second more historical definition of a desktop However they can also be in a deskside tower rackmountable or pedestal form factor just to name a few

This can be remedied by not using classes to determine size Instead use form factors such as blade rackmount deskside etc
