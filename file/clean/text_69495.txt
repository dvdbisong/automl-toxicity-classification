Renata Tebaldi was a great friend to me from 1958 and I am deeply saddened by the news of her death We have lost the greatest diva of the 20th Century and one of the ture great ladies of our times Listening to her Christmas album a while ago brought tears to my eyes  I will miss her deeply as a friend and a great diva  At this time of year I believe the only solas I have is to know that the newest angel and greatest angel will be leading the Christmas Chroir  God Bless you Dear Renata and may you rest in Peace  Love Dick
