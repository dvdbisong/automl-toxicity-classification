Sanity check 

Looking at this paragraph Before the 1960s the news media had no interest in Vietnam Black American journalists followed events only when breaking news happened in the region I know nothing about the subject matter hence reading the article but is this really relating specifically to Black journalists Or has someone vandalised If its accurate why are Black journalists special as opposed to all the rest Again I dont know but Id imagine they were in a considerable minority at that point 8617418473
