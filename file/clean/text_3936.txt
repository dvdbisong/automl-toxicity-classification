You resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile Binksternet
For starters dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009 while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1 he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion As im saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed no decision was made and the discussion ended Paulh or you did not say anything If he wanted the photo then why didnt he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then I wouldve left it at that then but instead he and other editors remained silent I didnt restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest or didnt have the time

Furthermore I did not slip in as you disgustingly dishonestly facetiously say I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January Again no one did anything for months You and Paulh cannot claim you didnt see the change because you made several other edits throughout the article for months

Again Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change or continue the discussion where it had left off Once again he instead changed the photo got a consensus from Binksternet The IP editor liked the photo but quoting the editor again

Any of the photos in that section FinancialNorthjpg Montgomerystreetsfjpg Federal Reserve Band San Franciscojpg except 2 SanFranciscoEmbarcaderojpg would be fine as a replacement and even the cropped version of 2 is better than the one currently there now Thoughts64815793 talk

Im going to replace it with FinancialNorthjpg and see what happens

The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it or I or other editors could respond

Binksternets abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts Despite my reverts I at least agreed to having a discussion and a photo choosing contest as it were Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing I dont see Binksternet asking the IP editor in question or other editors to the SF article including Optigan13 have their say either in this He is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus something that at least Paulh did earlier Only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me
