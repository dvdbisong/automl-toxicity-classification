Good day  I might be a bit  dramatic but there are some things that just need to be said about Wikipedia You see I consider myself a public servant a knight in shining armor if you will Some people might call me greedy for doing these edits and at times thumbing my nose at other editors most of the time I dont do that But guess what Greed for lack of a better word is good Greed is right Greed works Greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit Greed in all of its forms greed for life for money for love knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed And you know what Im greedy for Floquenbeam Im greedy for unbiased neutral Wikipedia articles Im the hero Wikipedia deserves its knight in shining armor However dont consider me your hero Im a silent guardian A watchful protector A Dark Knight Adios and best wishes
