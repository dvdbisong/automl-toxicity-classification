Class numbers in the 70s 

Was 7 under TOPS reserved for electrodiesels or for DC diesels

Empirically the Woodhead locos 76  77 do indeed suggest that the 7 series vs the 8 series was for indeed for DC locos catenary or 3rd rail However Ive never seen it claimed that this was particularly deliberate whilst I have read that the electrodiesels were deliberately grouped in this range Does anyone have a robust source  

In the meantime Ive reverted the change mostly to avoid the redlink If we do change this the link ought to point to a section within the TOPS article
