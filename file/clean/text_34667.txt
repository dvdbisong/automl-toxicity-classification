Hi On the Wikipedia WikiProject Christian Metal talk page you said that youve been an photographer for Cornerstone festival for years and could provide photos Basically any band on the List of Christian metal bands that dont have a free photo could use one Do you have photos for say Tourniquet Deliverance Saviour Machine Antestor Extol Crimson Moonlight Crimson Thorn Circle of Dust Barren Cross Stryper Bride or some other that have performed at Cornerstone If you wish to provide one or more photos I could help you adding them to Wikimedia Commons Basically that just needs your permission
