The problem is not what youre trying to say but how youre going about saying it  Quoting the subject of an article in the form She remembers saying is simply not encyclopaedic at all  That was the problem with the first as well  Nothing wrong with saying that she denied her rape had anything to do with her later career choice but write it like an encyclopaedia article and not a magazine piece or fan page  Similarly with the second one  say it if it needs to be said but not like this  Try At this time she stated her intention etc etc ref

The problem of unencyclopaedic style is present throughout the article  Examples include In her autobiography Massoli writes that  why not omit that and put a reference at the end  Preacher has denied this   why is this sentence in brackets  Jameson says  again more like a magazine article  The list of awards is meaningless really  It adds nothing to the article  Why not just have a sentence saying Her films have won numerous industry awards

And finally the length of the article is not appropriate  There is too much verbosity  Do you really think its reasonable for an encyclopaedia to give Jenna Jameson as much coverage as Gandhi
