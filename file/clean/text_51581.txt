Aha So Kayla and Kailina are the same but theres more to be explained After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialectslanguages just like Bender 19768 says but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992 first QemantKemantChemantKamantKimantinyaKimanteney and secondly KaylaKailaKailinya ethnonym Betə Israel cf Mann  Dalby 198716 xenonyms FalashaFelasha from Geez immigrant stranger Yihudi cf Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992 Kemant could be extinct by now Sommer 1992 mentions that according to Gamst Kemant is threatened by extinction In any case a huge language shift is going on here all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left out of an ethnic group of about 170000 people in 1998 Endangered to say the least
Quirin 1998 leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers coming from a common Agaw base developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on However apparently theres a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography cf eg  and I dont know enough about it at present to judge sources like this though Qurin seems to have done his homework
Anyway a third dialect seems to be QweraQuaraQwarinaKara of KwarasaHwaraHwarasa this one appears to be extinct cf Ethnologue It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant  Gamst pc to Sommer Sommer 1992358 proposes that Quara Quarinya spoken by a few Falasha in Quara to the west of Qemantland is nearly the same language as Qemant
