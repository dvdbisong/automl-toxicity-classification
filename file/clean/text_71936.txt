Summary from the Source
I went and summarized the source in my own words
Science shows that the Earth formed around 45 billion years ago The organisms that live on Earth have completely changed its air atmosphere this is called a biosphere 71 of Earths surface is covered in salt water oceans Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present The other 29 is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands

Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System particularly the Sun and the Moon The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 36525 days One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year This is why there are 365 days in a year but a leap day is added once every 4 years
Itd be great if someone could add that for me I have a rocket to catch Bye for now
