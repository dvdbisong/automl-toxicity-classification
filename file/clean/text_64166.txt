The rebels are an illegal organisation working outside the rule of law of the Republic of Syria thus anybody dealing with them is engaging in illegal dealings And also if you are involving international law in this discussion why is it than that financial and arms support for rebels in Iraq was considered to be illegal but according to you support for the rebels in Syria is not illegal I guess that has to do with that old saying One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter Assads government is still the Syrian government which is represented in the United Nations until that changes they are the legal government of Syria
