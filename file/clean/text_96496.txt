BIG UPDATE  This site has so many facts wrong and the reason I can tell you why they are wrong is because the individual typing this isnt Lance Cade  Its Lance McNaught  You figured out my real last name thats great  Youve got the year I was born wrong multiple events in my 3 years in MCW HWA and OVW completely wrong and please oh please dont get me started on my personal life section  Just because you read it online or even a newspaper where most of my personal facts came from doesnt mean they are completely correct  Im not trying to piss anyone off I actually appreciate this site because its purpose is to have the real facts about whoever it is in this world that you want to research  But Im telling you that if everyone that has posted info and claims to to have sites to back it up it would be nice to make sure that fact are indeed true
