Incorrect statement under Gameplay The leaves which turn out to be Super Leaves are blown across the Mushroom Kingdom bestowing raccoon tails on all living things they touch Similar statements are made throughout the article However they are not raccoon tails they are in fact tanooki tails two different animals hence Tanooki Mario not Raccoon Mario Sorry if this sounds picky but they are two totally different things TanookiTanuki holds a special place in many Eastern lores
