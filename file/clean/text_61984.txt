Doc Holliday Photo Problem

Yes I know that that photo of the darkhaird man you used is on file in Denver as Doc Holliday A different photo see the collar from the same photo session with the same man actually hangs in the Cochise County Courthouse in Tombstone and is also labeled Holliday But it isnt

The only authentic closeup we have of Holliday is the one in Karen Tanners book Doc Holliday A Family Portrait A standing picture we have of poor quality from 1879 shows hes still the same man by then still lighthaired as Wyatt says More importantly the two closeups we have are of men with different ears

See my note on the Doc Holliday discussion page It behooves us to get a noquestion photo of the real J Holliday on Hollidays wiki page  You can leave the other one in but include a caption that due to the ears some do not consider it authentic You can then let the reader judge
