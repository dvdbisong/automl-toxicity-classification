Yes youre right the release notes does not have this fix included for one reason or another I recorded the outbound connections using WireShark and BitComet does not connect to any servers if all options are disabled as it did in the earlier versions I think its a mistake made by the individual that has written this log 
However it does say GUI Improved new option in advanced setting page query task comment and snapshot info automatically
Disabling these two new options make it possible to seize all contact to BitComet servers 
The Hash Reporting is enabled by default by the way
