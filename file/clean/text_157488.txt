Exactly why this article should be deleted 
Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding as ITAQALLAH laments but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy and ignores any policies that I may cite why this article deserves to be deleted I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts

The article in its postcensorsed state is in violation of WPBLP
Let me quote from it 

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies especially

 Neutral point of view NPOV
 Verifiability
 No original research

This article violates requirement number One Neutral point of view NPOV

Now for idiotic editors like those who childishly colour their usernames who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV owing to their idiocy which I hope Eugenics will fix one day let me quote section 25 from the NPOV page

Balance

When reputable sources contradict one another the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page work for balance that is describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner

It says describe the opposing viewpoints And where does this article do that 
Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints it suppresses opposing viewpoints

This is why the article is biased censorsed and therefore must be deleted

I will be reinserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the describe the opposing viewpoints requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored
