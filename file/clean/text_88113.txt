i agree with the above but my question is what would be the correct dosing measures to follow No im not condoning the useage of speedballs but I would like for this information to be out there Not just for myself an exuser but for anyone who is going to do such I have friends that are going to try this and have no idea the dosings and how to mix it more than likly theyll end up making a bad mistake I personaly have never shot a speedball but have shot cocain on an addicted bases Some information id like to know is do you shoot two needles simultaneously into your veins or do you mix it in one needle and how much to use for casual users 

we have all thes resourses here saying not to do it but anyone thats ever been a user knows that not having the info wont stop you from experimenting I rather the information be readily available for people than to keep them in the dark and overdosing well ive said enough and if anyone would so kindly do such then thank you
