After this case the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre CEOP attempted a nationwide assessment of child grooming  The report found that police social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this hidden issue and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since 2008 were Asian an apparently disproportionate figure but Peter Davies the head of Ceop was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results He added that looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours

Again  Im not sure that this section needs to exist Also from the outset it is misleading CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming   they didnt suddenly decide to start after this case 

CEOP has existed since April 2006 and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since  starting its main recognised operations in 2009 by which time the police were acting The wording implies that CEOP had not acted earlier to protect the victims  they could not act they did not exist TTFN
