Blatant editorializing
DVdm what specific statement have I made that you consider blatant editorializing  I really have no idea what I did that could be considered blatant editorializing  I said The reader should note the equations to be solved are not the equations for a hyperboloid discussed above  Do you consider this statement to be blatant editorializing  Now the reason I said this is because the discussion of hyperbolas and hyperboloids could easily mislead the reader
