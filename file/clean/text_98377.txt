The Title Mormonism and Christianity 

I find that the title of this article immediately implies that Mormons are not Christians  Would you say Catholics and Christians or Presbyterians and Christians  I feel a much better title would be something like The Controversy about Are Mormons Christians or just Are Mormons Christians  I believe this is what you are really trying to discuss

As for my personal opinion on this topic  I have studied many religions  The differences between Hindus Buddhists Jews Muslims and Christians are obvious  At this level Mormons are certainly within the sphere of Christianity and Christian thought  I doubt that members of any of these other religions would consider Mormons anything other than Christians  Only from within Traditional Christianity is there a controversy  Just because Sunni Muslims believe the Shia are not truly Muslims does that place them outside the Moslem world
