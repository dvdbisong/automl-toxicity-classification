re Shadowclan AfD 

Hey just to let you know when youre nominating an article for deletion thats already been through the deletion process before like you did with Shadowclan you have to create a separate AfD page for the nomination not put it on the page of a previous nomination Ive already done this for you by moving the current nomination to WikipediaArticles for deletionShadowclan 3nd nomination but in the future you can create subsequent AFDs with either the afdx template or adding Xth nomination in with the article title in the normal AfD template   talk walk
