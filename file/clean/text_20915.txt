ImageJohn Vanbrughpng 

Hi Bishonen

I pushed your image ImageJohn Vanbrughpng to CommonsImageJohn Vanbrughpng and changed links to ImageJohn Vanbrughjpg  Im wondering how you digitized the image exactly  Did you use a scanner  Or a camera  And whatever you used did it produce PNG directly or did you do some conversion afterwards

Thanks   talk 1946 20 Feb 2005 UTC
