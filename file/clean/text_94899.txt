Suggestion New subsection under Activism for Reading Rainbow 

Seth MacFarlane agreed to match the Kickstarter of Reading Rainbow for up to 1 million Basically every dollar after the 4 million mark will be matched up to the 5 million mark I feel that after he officially makes that generous donation a subsection should be created under Activism Thoughts

Possible counterargument slippery slope This might lead to putting every investment he makes under an everincreasing Activism section
