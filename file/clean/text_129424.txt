As I said I simply reworded as best I could what was already there  I understood this to mean that because the amount of water droplets visible along the line of sight below the horizon is limited before you reach ground the amount of light refracted is insufficient to be noticeable  Above the horizon looking up into the sky you dont have this restriction   This is why viewing from a high vantage point allows for more to be visible at a greater angle  Again if you dispute this logic feel free to reword or remove as I originally did  Talk
