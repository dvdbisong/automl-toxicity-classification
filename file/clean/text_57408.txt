May I recommend the recently published book part of the Britain in Old Photographs series Netherton by Ned Williams Sutton 2006  available at all good bookshops and local libraries Incidently Netherton is certainly not part of Dudley Town although it is in Dudley MBC There are a number of historical and geographical reasons to support the separate nature of Netherton town I would be pleased to elaborate if requested but it is clear from the local press such as Dudley News local historians see Ned Williams above and local government and transport organisations that Netherton is regarded as separate from Dudley Town
