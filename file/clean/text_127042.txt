From User talkMathbotFeedback on the summary bot
 I do put a summary in if I think of it its not something thats automatic to me  I think most times if the changes were important to me Id be more inclined to add a summary if it was just minor corrections on things such as style grammar etc I didnt put anything in  

 Forgive me for pointing this out to a longtime respected Wikipedian but edit summaries arent for the contributing editor theyre for the folks reviewing edit histories to help them skim over what happened when without laborious paging through each edit Its far from perfect but it can be a real time and serversaver With all the maintenance work I do on Wikiquote and to a lesser extent on WP the lack of edit summaries has become a bête noire for me so Im happy to see Mathbot tackling this   talk
