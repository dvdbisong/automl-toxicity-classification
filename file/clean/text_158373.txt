The following things need to be retained
 A fuller quotation of Horowitz that conveys his charges and stated implications to Dees
 In fairness and to accomodate NPOV a balancing fuller quotation of Berlet would also be needed
 Reference to the allegations by Arabia against Berlets style of argument  eg critique for guilt by association and critique for squashing free speech
 Specification of how the dispute actually concluded  not simply see here For example it should be noted that SPLC stood by Berlet and Berlet responded plus Horowitzs counterresponse The fairest way of doing this is again to give both Berlet and Horowitz a representative quote in their own words
