Ha I know what you want to push in this article Xeeron I found this post in one of the forums its not yours Im sure but its logic fits your actions pretty well South Ossetia is NOT independent Russia needs to stay out of the conflict What happened in Georgia was a CIVIL war This should have played out on its own Russia is NOT a peacekeeper but instead is biased and should be removed from South Ossetia immediately Putin is pissed off because of Georgias plans of joining NATO and dropping CIS like a bad habit Putin wants to keep South Ossetia under his wing that way he can build his Natural Gas Pipeline through South Ossetia without Georgians permissian Russia is a BULLY and needs to repect Georgias sovereignty Putin is too occupied with becoming the new OPEC

Now I see your logic behind calling it a civil war

And what I like most about you Xeeron is you have a wonderful persistency in your mistakes Lets look at your sources

1 The BBC tells Georgia accuses Russia of arming the South Ossetian authorities  who have been trying to break away since the civil war in the 1990s Moscow denies the claim Nothing about civil war in Ossetia in 19911992 Its about Georgian civil war you must have missed this So  0 points for providing nothing

2 The randbilddebeta sounds reliable tells of civil war in 19901992 Dont you claim its 19911992 Anyway  the source is just a blog Blog of a fotographer having his contacts in huge letters on the 1st page Timo Vogt Fotograf 495863 atrandbildpunktde Do you still consider blogs to be reliable sources  1 for providing a nonreliable source

3 Were not going to discuss source that tells its defending Marxism right Why dont you just go and write an article about politics based on sources that underline they are created to defend neonazism or neocons then I think reliable source should be at least not biased Defending ism is biased So  1 again for providing a source that is created to defend Marxism

4 Eurasianet  wow A really interesting source Would it be their opinion that would be almost enough to claim some sources say SO war of 19911992 was actually a civil war But to my dissapointment these are just words of another fotographer Jonathan Alpeyrie is a war photographer for Getty Images I mean I adore Getty Im even their client for the last two years but I never knew they were a think tank did you A reliable server but another fotographer that does not count  0 again

Total  2 points 

Now back to the point See what sources do not consider 19911992 SO war to be a civil war Radio Free Europe  openDemocracynet featuring an article of the English professor of Caucasus studies  The Guardian  and  finally thats what your beloved BBC thinks of the war

In the twilight of the Soviet Union as Georgian nationalist Zviad Gamsakhurdia came to prominence in Tbilisi South Ossetia too flexed its separatist muscles Soviet forces were sent to keep the peace in late 1989 following violent clashes between Georgians and Ossetians in the capital Tskhinvali Violence flared again as South Ossetia declared its intention to secede from Georgia in 1990 and the following year effective independe
