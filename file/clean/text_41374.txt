Shupe Darnell source should be removed 

CAN We Hardly Knew Ye  Most interesting that this sourced as hosted at the CESNUR website for some reason neglects to mention that along with Shupe and Darnell another author of the paper is Kendrick Moxon  attorney for the Church of Scientology See the exact same paper as cited at this website where Kendrick Moxon is listed as one of the three authors of the paper Also see this cite in the book New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America
See Anson Shupe Kendrick Moxon and Susan E Darnell CAN We Hardly Knew Ye Sex Drugs Deprogrammers Kickbacks and Corporate Crime in the old Cult Awareness Network paper presented at the annual meeting of the Society of the Scientific Study of Religion Houston Texas 21 October 2000

See the exact same cite listing Kendrick Moxon as one of the authors of the paper here

Why even their own book authored by Shupe and Darnell Agents of Discord lists Kendrick Moxon as one of the authors of what Shupe and Darnell refer to as an unpublished paper
See Anson Shupe Kendrick Moxon and Susan E Darnell 2000 CAN We Hardly Knew Ye Sex Drugs Deprogrammers Kickbacks and Corporate Crime in the old Cult Awareness Network Unpublished paper presented at the annual meeting of the Society of the Scientific Study of Religion October Houston TX

This unpublished paper authored by Kendrick Moxon is not a reliable source
