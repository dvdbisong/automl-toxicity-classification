Being reasonable is good  Make sure though that you do not lapse into the same kind of behavior that lead to your recent block  How would it look to others if you came off a block and started doing the same things again  A general attitude of incivility is whats not accepted here its not about using one particular word or another  If you get a 24hour block and dont use the opportunity to cool down a bit youre only giving people reason to try a longer block
