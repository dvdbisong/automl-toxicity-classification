A case of forgery I found in her book was a quotation formed by taking parts of two sentences a few pages apart in a report and joining them together in the wrong order However generally fradulent would be a more accurate description as it covers biased editing of quotations selective presentation of sources and sometimes blantant lies about what sources contain  Better not start me on it  Some scraps of previous debate can be found at TalkPalestinian refugee  1214 15 Jul 2004 UTC
