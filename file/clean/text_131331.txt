Æµœš¹  I agree with your second option ie to follow that paragraph with further academic discussion or even report on a scholarly response to Baughs work  You should know that after checking the references again I discerned that you are abolutely correct  Indeed it is not Blackshire Belay that Baugh posits as his source for Afrocentic view number ii  Based on the footnote number 8 that appears after the first phrase in numder ii ie refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole8 Baugh actually attributes this view to Williams 1975 and Williams 1997   This prompts the question is the second phrase that appears to be a continuation of number ii which states or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English either also included as what DrWilliams posits  For if it is attributed to Dr Williams I still say it is not Afrocentric and to posit this phrase as an Afrocentric view is in fact an outright misrepresentation of what Dr Williams has stated
