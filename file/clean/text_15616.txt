I did not have anything to do with the material being added to the article in the first place  I was merely reverting the removal of sourced material  After that things escalated  I read the argument  made on the talk page was not swayed by it and honestly believed he was trying to remove the material because he simply did not like it  The majority of those commenting on the talk page disagreed with his argument  Furthermore Daily Kos was not the only source quoted so the argument that it was inadequate on its own seemed to be beside the point  The allegation that I was intentionally editwarring and pushing false information with inadequate sources is not quite accurate  I was reverting what seemed to me to be deletion of valid material that other editors had defended
All of this aside losing my temper as I have already stated was unjustified and I regret it TheFortyFive
