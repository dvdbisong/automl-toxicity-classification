Good job UC Bill Thanks I submit that all we need to settle out of this ArbCom is whether or not the previous RfC where the community rejected son of autoformatting was a fair and proper reading of the community consensus Locke dragged us all to this ArbCom because he said that RfC had been rigged with slanted questions It appears that you are conceding that while you back your code you acknowledge that the community doesnt want son of autoformatting If that is the case I think we are done here on ArbCom on that issueWikipedia is a hobby were all volunteering our efforts And I would dislike it a great deal if I worked on something that few Wikipedians wanted If I were you Id solicit input on what exactly the community wants through RfCs of your own Id also drop posts on the talk pages of known opponents of son of autoformatting like Tony Dabomb87 Ohconfucious and me in order to get a clear understanding of what the community would really like to receive and then go to work on that  talk
