Re Personal attacks 

I have removed the following statement from WikipediaArbitration Committee Elections January 2006VoteKarmafist
but i would support electing Karmafist as most abusive mendacious hypocritical and unfit admin in the WP project
I feel that this statement constitutes a personal attack and therefore have removed it If you disagree with this action please discuss either on user talk or on the talk page of the Arbcom vote  TALK  CONTRIBS 
thanks for informing me  i reworded it to indicate more of what Karmafist has done rather than simply what he is  i believe this information is important for people to read lest Karma do to them what he has done to me  when an abusive and unfit admin of whom two of the present ArbCommissioners have voted to desysop him tries to increase his power by running for ArbCom there is certainly increased danger of abuse and harrassment to legit editors of WP
