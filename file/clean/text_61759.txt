Possible conflict of interest
Welcome to Wikipedia I wanted to bring your attention to our policy on conflict of interest If you are a representative or an employee of the Missions or if you have any such tie or affiliation to the club then it is greatly discouraged that you edit San Antonio Missions or any of its related articles 

If you have any questions about this or any baseball or policyrelated topic on Wikipedia then please send me a note on my talk page

Thanks   needs to be running more often
