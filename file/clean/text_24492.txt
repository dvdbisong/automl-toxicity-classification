and his contributions are pitiful esp eg he claims to have been a scholar on the depresion time period of the 1920s30s  but THEN in fact his actions substantially created the 
recent and ongoing financial crisis AS Bernanke TO COMBAT extreme price manipuluations by speculators in hiking prices of gold  oil  Bernanke instituted an extreme monetary squeeze after the mortgage crisis had begun THAT extreme servere monetary squeeze is what has almost tossed the USA into a depression again but this so called clown who claims to be an expert on the 30s depression is the one who did all that  such CLEAR facts needed to be added to the article and talk page for adding to the article and the fact that YOU are so entirely ignorant of all the FACTS about this means YOU SHOULD NOT BE EDITING IT OR commenting on my suggestion to add that to the Bernanke article  and that YOU SHOULD MOVE ON GET a life and stop pretending to be a wiki editor when you DO NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE and use technical terms to block what my attempted additions were  extremely needed info about the head financial guy in the USA WHO IS IN FACT an inexperienced CLOWN same as you are a clown in pretending to be a wiki editor 

and these general remarks apply to ab every mention of this page as  I WILL ADD  as a unique special expert remarks intended to be discussed to be included 
in the article and one of the wiki CLOWN editors will freak out  attack me and claim
my remarks are inappropriate BECAUSE the clown editor is so unknowledgeable about the subject
he does not discern I AM MAKING AN EXPERT SUGGESTED ADDITION TO THE ARTICLE
