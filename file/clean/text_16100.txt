Ditto on GAN To me the article is ready though I still intend to make some minor edits On another front I think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands even though I disagree with Heylins assessment of midJuly which he guesses at based on the fact that BoB made its debut on the charts on July 30 see Shades p 264 I find that ridiculous For example BIABH took six weeks from its official release on March 7 1965 to reach the charts May 8 Highway 61 got out much quicker with a onemonth lapse from its August 20 release before charting Going back earlier Another Side took about six weeks to chart and Freewheelin more about than three months  Using midJuly then means giving BoB  two weeks to debut which is absurd Of course the whole problem centers on what is meant by release In this case its being used to mean distribution which was obviously delayed in BoBs case However the Billboard advertisement of June 25 gives at least three other clues to that pressing packaging and promotion With those three in place distribution couldnt have been more than a week behind if not already in motion
