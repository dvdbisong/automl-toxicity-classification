Mughals 

Claiming that the Mughals were a Turkic people and mentioning some odd Turkish name given to them a name that does not appear in ANY historical or scholarly sources is pure POV 

The Mughals were neither Turks in ethnicity they were originally Mongols descening from the Timurid and other Chingizid families of Central Asia  Berlas Mongols nor in language starting with Humayun they were certainly and evidently Persianspeakers Akbar did not even know Chaghatay  he had to translate his grandfathers memos into Persian to read them Later the Mughals were evidently Urdu speaking

I do not know why certain users keep putting that POV paragraph into the article They claim that it is sourced  but not all sources are good Why do they ignore the whole bunch of other mostly authoritative sources such as the works of Prof BF Manz THE leading expert on Timurid and TurcoMongol history see BF Manz Tīmūr Lang in Encyclopaedia of Islam Online Edition 2006 They only stick to certain versions of the Britannica  only those that suite them They totally ignore other sections of Britannica that actually have a totally different opinion on the isse For example this one

 Baber The first Mughal or Mongol emperor of India 152630 and founder of the Mughal Dynasty there was Baber He also won distinction as a military commander a gifted poet and diarist a statesman and an adventurer As ruler of the principality of Fergana in Turkestan his birthplace Baber first tried to recover Samarkand the former capital of the empire founded by his Mongol ancestor Timur Lang  

The Columbia Encyclopaedia states

 Timur timoor or Tamerlane tămurlān c13361405 Mongol conqueror b Kesh near Samarkand  

The paragraph about the Mughals should be removed Even IF some people believe that they should be listed only because their FIRST ruler Babur wrote his memoires in Turkic the paragraph should be removed because its controversial Memoires do not prove anything especially in regard of the fact that Humayuns biography is written in Persian by his sister Gulbadan Begum and that Shah Bahadur II is known as one of the greatest Urdu poets 

In no way the Mughals were a Turkic people  neither in origin nor in ethnicity culture language or influence
