So suddenly a blog is an admissible source And This is not only a controvertial claim but a provably false one The illustration on this blog shows a 1932 patent which is not for a flying saucer Its a patent for another replacement for a propeller No one could read this patent without realizing this so its pretty obvious that Olteanu is either intentionally posting false claims or didnt care enough about this subject matter to check the patentnot very likely obviously if he really thought this patent might say what he chose to claim it says he would have posted the whole thingThe other drawings all date to the 50s Which interestingly enough is when that brilliant rocket scientist and Coanda scholar Stine says the Aerodina lenticulara was invented
