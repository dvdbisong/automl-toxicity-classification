Ive read a few articles and its getting frustrating There is literally nothing they all agree on The reason why all judgements are subjective and no one is an expert Even in usually reliable sources like eg the BBC theyre just puff pieces I think the 1st paragraph of the section is ok about how the films not meant to be realistic as are the last 3 self lacing shoes hoverboards and the Cubs but Im beginning to think the discussion of what it did and didnt get right should be removed entirely Instead replace it with a generic Especially around 2015 many articles speculated on what the movie did and didnt get right followed by a few links
