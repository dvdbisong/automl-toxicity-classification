bogus features
     Integrated link management
every feature should be integrated otherwise it wouldnt be a feature
     Typographic filters for proper formatting and styling of text
give me an example of a nontypographic filter please and the whole Generates standardscompliant XML XHTML and CSS makes this feature redundant
     Extensible plugin support
if wordpresses plugins are extensible what does a nonextensible plugin system look like

you may get bonus points in school for adding pointless adjectives to nouns but on wikipedia it only serves to distract
