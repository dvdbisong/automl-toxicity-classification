I think the Tall Ships stuff in the article is getting off topic and should properly be in Tall ship since it relates primarily to a discussion of Tall Ships and only secondarily to sail training And I hacked about with the first para for the reason that I was uncomfortable with the word unconventional when from the initial words sail training must once have been very conventional albeit presumably Nelson would not have known it by that name 

I think also you may be being a bit didactic though Ive never been sure about the meaning of that word First and foremost sail training is not intended to be like a vacation or With many options out there it can be a difficult choice  Im not sure what advice to give to change anything but it sails close to being a promotional piece  albeit of the very highest quality  for sail training rather than an encyclopedia article about sail training Meanwhile I continue to salute your work in sail related articles and kinda hope that your interests wrt wikipedia broaden since you are clearly something of an asset  talk
