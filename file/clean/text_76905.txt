Ok thank you Paul Having read that it is very clear that my use of the Primary source was in absolutely the right way and that Augustins publicvation comes under the Novel interpretation category and is therefore minority view The Primary source is not only clear it is also backed up by the commentary  and therefore secondary source offered by Hippolytus As you may remember from history classes a source is primary only where its comments are not upon a prior source in which case they become secondary It is therefore not possible to consider any commentary on a source still with us today as primary but only secondary Josephus is thus both a primary and secondary source Best wishes81103121144
