No you said both earlier and now that anarchocapitalism was conflated with anarchism In fact what Molinari wrote about is anarchism but Molinaris anarchism was not acknowleged as such until Rothbard publicized it in the 1960s Molinari didnt call it anarchism himself because he associated the term with his contemporary Pierre Proudhon and socialism
