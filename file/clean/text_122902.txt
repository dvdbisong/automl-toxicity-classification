But what local governments tend to do is declare a redevelopment zone to susidize  typically housing  development  The new property taxes go to subsidizefund the development through the local redevelopment agency and the local governments have to slap a Mello Roos tax on the property to keep up funding for police fire schools etc to maintain fiscal neutrality This mello roos is on top of property taxes and makes the housing even more expensive Id really like to see a good strong source for what youve heard
