Initial comments 
At first pass this looks quite good Its comprehensive well sourced and well written and seems generally ripe for promotion Ive made a few tweaks as I went feel free to revert any with which you disagree

Here are a few quibbles that I couldnt immediately resolve myself

Id suggest splitting the lead into two paragraphs for readabilityperhaps at Increased expenses and decreasing ridership
with two railroad stations in operation one on the CO line and the Union Station just west of the CO station at the junction between the CO and Southern railroads  I found this part of the sentence hard to follow at first glance maybe break this off as a second sentence two railroad stations in operation One was on the CO line and the second the Union Station was just west Am I understanding the meaning correctly in this rewrite
Development of the streetcar system  Id suggest breaking this long paragraph into at least two for readability Perhaps at this continued until
Route Description  split large paragraph for readability
Two statements here that it would be better to fix in time per WPREALTIME for clarity in the longterm

 though no concrete plans have been developed or implemented as of 2012
