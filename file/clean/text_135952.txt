Itycene vs Iptycenes 

First of all thank you for your contribution to the article When creating the article i was thinking about wheter to a sungular or plural form A find the plural form more logical since iptycene is a general name several compounds with varying constitution qualify as an iptycene I understand that e g arene and alkene articles are also in singular but I dont really understand why Is it simply a matter of agreement Thank you
