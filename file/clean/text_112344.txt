I guess you didnt understand what I meant in my last message Ill try to be more concise The article needs a major rewrite There is not one section posing a problem The entire article is not written in an encyclopedic manner in a neutral tone It presents one side as right and goes out of its way to prove it and then gives a small section of criticism in a way that makes it seem as if the criticism is coming from a small group of people and is unfounded
