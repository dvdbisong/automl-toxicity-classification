Copyright tag 

This is concerning ImagePalau and oceaniajpg  As part of the WikipediaUntagged Images project I have tagged it as possibly unfree because I could not determine its copyright status  It seems likely that it is in the public domain but I didnt have enough information to tag it that way  You can help this project by applying WikipediaImage copyright tags to all of your uploaded images  Thank you   Edwin Stearns  Talk 1859 14 Dec 2004 UTC
