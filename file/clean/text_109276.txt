Error of preposition 

I have changed the following travel from the Earth to its Moon in July 1969

To the following travel from the Earth to the Moon in July 1969

The Moon is not Earths Moon it is the Moon It is Earths natural satellite that happens to be named Moon Using the term Moon as a catchall for natural satellites promotes ignorance and scientific inaccuracy No one would call other planets Earths so why should other natural satellites be referred to Moons
