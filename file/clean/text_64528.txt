The Ethiopian birr model 

You suggested to use this model in some cases In my opinion it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights especially the right to have its own currency like pre2006 Montenegro or presentday Kosovo Therefore in the case of Ethiopian birr it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 19521960 and between 19931997 between 19601993 only Ethiopian administration existed Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro The same case of Austria between 19381945 Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union membership however both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945 

I have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes For example after WWII Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938 but three villages near to Pozsony  Bratislava Horvátjárfalu  Jarovce Oroszvár  Rusovce Dunacsúny  Cunovo were awarded to Slovakia Treaty of Paris due to strategic considerations One could say that who cares with three villages but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars  and it is not much smaller than Muraköz Medimurje

So I dont think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box Only mention if the currency of a new country  state  autonomous province etc so a statelike subject that has the right to circulate its own currency appears without precedessor like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993 but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea or disappears without successor like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990 but unlike WestGerman mark after the reunification

For example German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 19482001 It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into WestGermany contrary to the widely used reunification term at least from the point of view of the circulating currency It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory 

In the case of the pengő I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946 Northern Transylvania Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of thenYugoslav federal states present day US states or German federal states

Naturally this is only my opinion I would like to know your thoughts
