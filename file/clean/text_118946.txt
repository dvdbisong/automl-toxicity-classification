Ah but this is not a mere matter of Manutdglorys bias If this were about his clear dislike or resentment of California Supreme Court decisions that would be bias This instead appears to me that he is insisting that a  number of verifiable welldocumented facts  here the Prop 8 ballot title wording the history of how that title came to be and the history of the law that established the right to marry in California  must be excluded from the article or even from discussion here That is not bias it is something more than bias Id call it a phobia
