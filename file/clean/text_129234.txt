A suggestion 

Im Comae again At the Spanish Wikipedia we have been talking about  genealogical trees It would be very useful for Mithology kings Tolkien and others The trouble is that we cant find an usable way to do it getting links in the tree Ive used HTML lists but they dont make the cut Tables are difficult to edit and correct I was trying to do it with timelines which may come in handy but its not as intuitive for nontech people to edit later Now I see you are already busy with all the trouble with timelines but I thought you may use a suggestion for future versions or find an alternative Thank you for the patience I hope you can understand this strange babbling I call my English esUserComae 0103 29 Jun 2004 UTC
