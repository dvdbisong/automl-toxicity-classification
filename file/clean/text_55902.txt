Father Son Holy Ghost 
ENDLESS PREJUDICE

Love direction of construction all in one Its indispensable People get lost all the time for immersing fame delusion but earn gross profit for pure mind Dangerous people are so vain to communicate because of foolish There are too many options  we cannot just enjoy those things we owned but really for growing benefic wisdom everyday under the sunlight If every envy heart traversing or misleading wrong road of destruction its a little bit unfair what I want its not an explaination may be theres no isolation  So can we own all the knowledge this moment or this life  You may say it is the greatest treasure but not to hold All of us have three heads and facing north east south and west Theres nothing but we still need to face it  You are one of the protector brother and I know you can feel bad when you get in a bad mood Never hold it  never trust anybody and please put it down  never ever  Time will tell  And I hope you can reach my voice of hope someday this life
