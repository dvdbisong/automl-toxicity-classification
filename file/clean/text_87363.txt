I content SimarilsarenotRings comment is important to the summary for lay readers 

I contend the differentiation between the Simarils and the Rings is necessary Its the primary reason that I hit the Simarils page trying to convince people that they were different I finally found it in other places This is not the first time that Ive had this conversation There are three stones old there are ancient rings made with special gems the association is completely natural to a lot of people who dont study Tolkein very much
