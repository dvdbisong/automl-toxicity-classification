You obviously do not understand my point The article is named Football firm only because someone probably from the British Isles started the article but as firm is a dab page heshe decided that football firm was a good title However that person did not know that some firms in some countries do not always support a football club Thus it is the title that should be changed and not the content of the article The solution to the problem is not to remove content And no matter how much you think your edit is justified you still broke 3RR Go read the policy page go back and revert your edit or I will report you    Talk
