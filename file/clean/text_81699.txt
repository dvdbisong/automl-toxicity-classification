You are now an administrator 

Congrats Your request for adminship passed with 24 supports to 2 opposes which is equal to a 923 support to oppose ratio As such I have promoted you to administrator which means you now have access to several neat administrative cleanup and upkeep tools at your disposal

As a new administrator you should read relevant policies and pages linked to the administrators reading list before you carry out tasks such as blocking users deleting and protecting pages and editing protected pages such as the Main Page Remember that most of what you will be doing will be easily reverted by other admins apart from page moves and image deletion I personally suggest reading the administrators howto guide in order to learn some of the ropes If you have any questions at all please feel free to ask me for help Welcome to adminship  drop me a line
