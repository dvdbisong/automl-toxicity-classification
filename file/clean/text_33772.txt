Why not address issues  

There should not be nonChristians on a list of converts to Christianity That is the issue This is not a voting process This is a talking process We know perfectly well that the majority can be wrong This is in its simplest understanding a list of those Christians who arrived at Christian identity by way of conversion Why are any of us trying to expand it to include more The concept of this list is the listing not of those who have experimented with Christianity but of those who have found Christianity Did Dylan and the two others find Christianity or is it more correct to say that they experimented with Christianity It almost seems as though one is penalized for experimentation Should a Jew be cautious in checking out Christianity That is the lesson that we gain from the goings on here Dylan is not a convert to Christianity Please compile a list of converts to Christianity Dont include on it those who are Jews or those who are of any other religion Please include on it only Christians It is abusive of the list to do otherwise
