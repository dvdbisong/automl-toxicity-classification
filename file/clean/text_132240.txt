Including an article on Wikipedia 

Re  In order for an article to be included on Wikipedia there must be reliable published thirdparty sources that focus on that topic Without such sources a neutral verifiable encyclopedic article on that topic cannot be made so the article is sooner or later deleted Articles on topics that are not independently notable are often merged into related articles such as an article on the band Also note that titles like musician are not added to an article unless there are multiple topics with the very same name such as multiple articles with the same name Michael Madden Otherwise articles reside at the proper name See WikipediaNaming conventions for more information talk
