External links
Hi  This account appears to exist only to add links to a specific web site to Wikipedia  Im afraid that this is not within the rules no matter what the value of the link may be if you are here to promote that web site you fit our definition of a spammer  If youre interested in helping improve the encyclopedia you could try adding content to the articles but you shouldnt make any more links to that site  talk  contribs
