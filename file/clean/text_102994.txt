Again your anger and personal hatred over the internet is amusing and saddening all at once  Im sorry you take life far too seriously  And I made note of the Scherer connection simply because you acted out like a child and naturally tried to tell me your friend was far more knowledgeable than I in the field of professional wrestling Now that may be the case but the manner in which you went about it was not very likable I dont know you personally so I will just assume you needed a nap and are a far better person than you have shown to me Once again being so angry isnt healthy and I really wish you would lighten up Life is too short
