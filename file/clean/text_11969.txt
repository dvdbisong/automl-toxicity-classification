Melchoir my logic is flawless and I know very well what you are trying to do You might as well give up here because there is no analogy between this proof and 0999  1 There is simply no way you can start off with 0999 and end up with 1 using transitivity of equality Why Because 0999 is not equal to 1 It is less than 1
