ecCall me idealistic but wouldnt most scientists and encyclopiedists believe that the archaeology is the same regardless of what you call the place Reliable sources may employ different names but do the high quality archaelogical sources say theyre focusing on different elements because its Israeli or Palestinian Archaeology nah From a wikipedia standpoint wouldnt it make more sense to have a main article elucidate the best scientific knowledge of the area yah Then you all could put POV  interpretations motivations politics etc into distinct Palestinian or Israeli sections or articles Ciao   Talk
