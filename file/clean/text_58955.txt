I think the answers to these questions are unfortunately a bit muddled  Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking or knowing  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasilegitimate warlords  But the Taliban and AlQaeda are not parties to any agreement  To my understanding without an agreement in place between sides there is no peacekeeping  Security Assistance the SA in ISAF to me is a subset of the military term peace support operations peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations  In the end I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative and I have seen no mention of the term peacekeeping on any of the main documents I have looked at  I dont claim to be an authority and soldiers and bureaucrats and politicians argue about the meaning of words all the time but to me peacekeeping has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit
