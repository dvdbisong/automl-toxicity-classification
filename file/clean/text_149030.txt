British Isles

I see you have warned me but witheld any warning from people who clearly share your own view that Ireland belongs to the British Isles and who have abused me in the process So my retaliation to their censorship is wrong but their assertion over us the Irish people is legitimate Clearly you are a British nationalist because if you had a scintilla of an openmind you would know that my views represent the majority viewpoint in Ireland In fact a brief search of the British Isles talkpage will tell you that But alas you dont wish to know Dont come near me again with your prejudice
