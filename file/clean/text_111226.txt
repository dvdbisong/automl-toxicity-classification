Thanks see I knew there was a good reason I asked  Know that you mention it I think your right regarding the shape and number of the articles that could be featured Maybe once I get a few more cleaned up I will revisit the idea  I have only recently started dabbling in GAs and Featured pictures and I have yet to have much success with DYKs or topics but I am planning to look into those again as well to build up the MOH content Right now there are several Featured lists no featured articles but a couple that I think have the potential Charles Lindbergh Eddie Rickenbacher Teddy Roosevelt and a few others but still need some work I have 2 MOH recipients in GA review now but it takes at least a month typically before anyone looks at them Charles Lindbergh just got out of Peer review and I am going to submit that up for the next level review a couple more Eddie Rickenbacher and Teddy for peer review etc etc My goal is to have at least a dozen articles to GA or better by the end of the year and all the lists except maybe the ACW still got a lot of work to do so well see
