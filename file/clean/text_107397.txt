Thank you thats very kind of you  I reached my boiling point yesterday and completely blew up  It was quite a lot of fun really  Kelly Martin needs to be brought down to size IMHO  Also he apparently doesnt know as much relevant law as I do even if he did attend two years of law school  What I left on his user page was not a specific threat aimed at him  Hell it wasnt even a threat  It was a description of my feelings  Also he apparently lives in Chicago and I live in Southern West Virginia  Threats across state lines are almost never followed up  Cops have better things to do  I could have told him I actually wanted to kill him and the police still would not do anything  Except offer a totally useless restraining order  I guess I have the practical knowledge he lacks  And if they did something which is about as likely as me winning the next Powerball  Id just be placed in a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold and that aint no thang  I chuckle however at the thought of a dishevelled cross dresser shambling into a police station reeking of BO and Mad Dog Lubriderm and semen and saying that someone threated to kill him  I think the police wouldnt have a problem imagining why someone might want to do that
