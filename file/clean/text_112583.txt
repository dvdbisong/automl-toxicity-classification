Hmmm but the situation there Madrid and Spain in general is also not so good now The unnemployment is huge My favourite place in Spain is Benalmadena a costal town near Marbella where all the cool Spanish people use to go because Marbella is too turistic and Benalmadena was still undiscouvered by the people or mass tourism Another reason are the great golf courses that are near PSYou said in your comment we are just a little bit richer it cant apply to Serbia because its way much poorer than in the 80s Yugoslav Serbia was way better There was freedom to travel to Yugoslav citizens wasnt even required visas for majority of western countries and had limited throu private property or companies We had the EURO in 1976 Olympic winter games in 1984 the nonalignement was a very interesting initiative Younger people even in Serbia too doesnt know much of that Almost all Serb families had a house on the Adriatic going skiing was usual travelling to Austrian or Swiss Alps to Italy or Spain in summer was normal to many Belgraders I see you been to South Serbia Ni≈° and Leskovac but you should have in mind that Belgrade and the northern part was and is way more richer double or even more About the separatism it was a huge error for Serbia not to allow to Croatia and Slovenia to be independent during the monarchic period All the rest of the country was suposed to belong to Serbia call me nationalist but that is a fact Even Yugoslavia was created so there wouldnt be a big orthodox Kingdom of Serbia Neither Vatican Austria Germany or Turkey neither France and UK with excuse of the possibility of that Serbia becoming a allied of Russia wanted that so a neutral Yugoslavia was imposed About the SerbianBulgarian problem it all begin when Serbia was not allowed to have direct access to see so it had to be compensated with lands part of current Macedonia that were suposed to belong to Bulgaria I know and recognise that You have the maps on the page Kingdom of Serbia where you see that the SerboBulgarian border was moved east so that Albaian state was created All current Eastern Macedonia was given to Serbia as compensation for taking Albania from Serbia We could talk centuries about it wright
