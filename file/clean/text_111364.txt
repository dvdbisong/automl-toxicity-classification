A reaction to the above comment 

Some good points here some of which are accounted for very well on the page about the SWP US It seems better that this entry on Barnes remain focussed on Barnes himself rather than the SWP
DICTATORSHIP OR DEMOCRACY  Its an excellent point to say that its pointless and misleading to demonise Barnes Clearly there was a qualitative change in the politics of the SWP during the 1980s Barnes clearly played a leading role in this process but had the national committee majority behind him Most would also say that the SWP organisational and democratic norms changed those who were expelled such as the Fourth International Tendency argued it was done undemocratically and wrongheadedly
BREAKING WITH TROTSKYISM  This seems a fair description of the SWPs evolution However if the SWP feel it unfair it would be better to write of a break with Trotskys theory of Permanent Revolution and the struggle to build the Fourth International In so far as Trotsky agrees with the Leninism and opposition to Stalinism and the third period the SWP agree with him However Trotskyism clearly refers to the politics of the movement that Trotsky and the SWP founded the FI The defining aspects of that movement permanent revolution in the developing world antibureaucratic revolution in the workers states and the notion of socialist democracy Of course the SWP no longer calls itself Trotskyist and the word is dropped for example from the title of Joseph Hansens book on Cuba
CASTROISM  Similary it is mistaken to call the SWP a Castoist party The SWPs New International strategy in the 1980s and 1990s was one of convergence with the Castroist current However its clear that the SWP has its own ideology
