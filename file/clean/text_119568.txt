Youre mistaken I wasnt sure what you were referring to And youre mistaken about my motive I dont want you blocked I want to challenge your assertion that the wishes of the subject are irrelevant Theyre relevant to me Theyre relevant to the subject I bet theyre relevant to a lot of people here 

The other question Id like to discuss is the appropriateness of you editing the article of a subject whom youve described in insulting and gratuitously demeaning terms My problem with that is that it makes you not a fit and proper person to edit that page Im struggling with the obvious selfevidency of that I see that as an obviously humiliating position to put our subject in I guess its the certain social hurt the man will experience knowing someone who called him what you called him will be writing the article the world goes to to learn about him that rules you out So it comes back to the first question above to what extent do we take account of distress

And you wont be blocked for anything you say about me here at least not by anyone with a brain
