Norton Commander Image Redundancy Tag Removal
Hey I didnt put those tags there They were put there by some asshole with some sort of bot I think the images are very illustrative in fact of the whole MSDOS to Windows journey which NC was a witness to in its various incarnations This was why I added the fair use rationalisations and a request to remove the redundancy tags However Im not sure how image deletion works Is it safe to just delete those tags like you just did Wont this authorize a bot to delete the images now Please get back to me on this
