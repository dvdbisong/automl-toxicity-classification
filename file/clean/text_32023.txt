List of prophets in intro 

Hey all  The list of prophets was fleshed out to the closer to full list of known accepted prophets  I knwo this list has been kept short by agreement way back so im putting this topic here to allow people to discuss which prophets should be listed if any and how many  I believe theres a more comprehensive list elsewhere in the Bahai articles which mention Hud the prophet to the Sabeans Noah etc all prophets that would have to go into a full list of prophets accepted by Bahais  I think its all two long  

My own view is that Jesus Moses and Muhammad make sense because these are central prophets to religions that are typically seen as Abrahamic religions  Buddha is added I suspect to clarify that the religion is not outside of connection to Dharmic traditions either  Obviously a full treatment of prophets the nature thereof and the relationships between them would be inappropriate in the lead paragraph  Anybody have a bright idea for better summarization of the point without toasting off the lead paragraph as unreadable
