BLP ethnicity gender 

Remember a couple of years back when I tried a common subpage for both policy and guidelines And you objected so we split them back up

Well as I predicted theyve diverged over time And now the wikilawyers are arguing that policy trumps guidelines  Since the BLP policy doesnt specifically mention Ethnicity and Gender while at least a half dozen guidelines do its been disrupting WPCFD and WPEGRS and quite a bit else

Could you take a look at the main above and see whether you support adding Ethnicity and Gender into the policy

And do you know of anywhere that the Policy and Guidelines has language about precedence

I suppose that this boils down to prescriptivism versus descriptivism yet another matter we have discussed We need both because the wikilawyers look for loopholes
