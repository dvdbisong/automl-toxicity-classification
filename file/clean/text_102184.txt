Changes
HiI have made the changes to the article What I ended up with is slightly different than what I submitted below I welcome your input I tried to maintain the core and format of the orginal article I thought that the original article only gave the insurance industry point of view so I retained that and added the health insurance reformers or consumers point of view I didnt want to get too technical or statistically is that a word since this is a general interest encyclopedia 
I learned about the wik from an article in the Atlanta Journal Constitution April 17 
I have created an account Since Im new Im not sure about procedures so feel free to tell me if I mess up
