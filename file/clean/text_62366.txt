FLEWIS 

Okay Flewis Im not going to say anything more to hurt your feelings  I can tell you can dish it out but cant take it and thats not your fault its your mommys fault for not teaching you to be a man  I dont think we can be friends but we dont have to fight anymore eiether  Its good enough that you know how me and the boys feel about you without having to say it outloud
