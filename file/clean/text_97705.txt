Im not some Wikipedia whore so my life doesnt revolve around it Im a regular person who enjoys to watch The Best Years and many of my friends and I check back to wikipedia for information of The Best Years and we all agree that having a seperate page really helps and it give others a chnace to add what they know about the show Lets just leave it the way it is for now and see what happens in the future If nothing happens as in people dont contribute to the articles then we can merge them back
PS I didnt remove any discussion headers Someone else must have or you just didnt add one
