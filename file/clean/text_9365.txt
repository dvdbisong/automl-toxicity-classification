Heaven of God 

To understand Heaven then God must be understood
 1  God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe  
 2  Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen and defined as everything known and unknown  Any concept of a multiuniverse shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces but only one Universe  A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions  The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace  The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself  The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions
 3  God is either above the Universe as the creator or part of some subspace of the Universe or both above and part of the Universe  The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe and God is not above the Universe negates Gods existence therefore the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God
 4  God is supreme over the Universe  It is Gods creation and obeys Gods rules  Each rule can be obvious or nonobvious and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known
 5  God has the ability to create and destroy energy  Without such a thing then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition but Gods energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy
 6  God is smart is intelligent is wise has knowledge is a creator is good is benevolent has mercy and has understanding  God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe  
 7  God expects Gods creation to do well since as a creator then the Universe was created for Gods purpose and enjoyment therefore life elements of Gods creation such as people are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom understanding and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good
 8  Because God is supreme then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God
 9  God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole or God can interact with the Universe in part therefore God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important  
10  It is always believed that God likes people so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer
11  God likes to be acknowledged from Gods own creation so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe
12  Love God  Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society family nation benevolence and many good things of life  Be who you are as a person and love God and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people 

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way  Each person can get a personal Heaven or Heaven may be a interaction for people or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people  Heaven is always defined as a good place but a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life attitude and existence where God could give us by observation an environment where the individual prospered  The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species

God can define Heaven in any way and Heaven is defined as a good place but as a supreme being God can allow many things and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many if not endless possibilities  God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many  Love God
