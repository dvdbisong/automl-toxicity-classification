George B Lyle 

Wondering if you can confirmdisprove the lifespan of George B Lyle As far as I can figure Lyle and this guy are the same person which would give him a birth year of c 1884 He was active as a councilman during the late 1920s according to a Google News search so all the facts fit but I have no smoking gun to connect the two for certain Can you find anything  Paul
