Im sorry  You were altering another editors text  That is at best bad wikiquette and at worst vandalism  Then you reverted my rollback with the edit summary rvv which was misleading  I assume good faith that you didnt realize that changing the text of a discussion archive was a bad thing despite the text immediately above it that says do not modify it but when an admin rolls your edits back my advice is to consider whether they may have a better grasp on what Wikipedia considers vandalism than you  Now Hipocrite has told me that the situation is resolved  If you say you agree I will unprotect that page
