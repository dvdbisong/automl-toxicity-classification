I dont think its equivalent to the sieve of eratosthenes even when the optimization of using only odds is used
Here is what Sieve of Sundaram looks like where we loop at a  2i  1 and b  2j  1 instead of i and j
n  1000000  limit

 initialize the sieve
is_prime2  true
is_primei  i is odd  i  3 n

for all odd a such that 3  a and a²  n
    for all odd b such that a  b and ab  n
        is_primeab  false

while Sieve of Eratosthenes using only odd integers roughly looks like this only one line is added
n  1000000  limit

 initialize the sieve
is_prime2  true
is_primei  i is odd  i  3 n

for all odd a such that 3  a and a²  n
    if not is_primea continue       only this has changed
    for all odd b such that a  b and ab  n
        is_primeab  false

This also shows that the Sieve of Sundaram is less efficient than the Sieve of Eratosthenes and that its complexity is Θn log n since 12  13  14    1n grows asymptotically as log n compared to sieve of eratosthenes Θn log log n since 12  13  15  17    1p grows asymptotically as log log n
