By the way now that Ive read your entire blog entry its excellent and I totally agree with you  Its just not appropriate to link here  If it were there would be a thousand such links in HRCs article  

A more appropriate way to do this might be to add a paragraph to the article and link to your blog as the source something like
Hillary faces two major obstacles to getting elected in 2008  The last Northeasterner and the last Senator elected president was John F Kennedy in 1960  Prior to that the last senator elected president was Benjamin Harrison in 1888 
Someone may still object to it but its much more subtle this way and Wikipedia loves text with sources much more than external links  
Also remember to sign your responses on this page using four tildes as shown above
