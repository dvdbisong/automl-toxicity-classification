I kind of disagree with what youre saying The games are in mostly chronological order They are in the order of for PC games mainframe games  Golden Era games  Interplay which straddles the Golden Era and the late 1990s  the Diablo series which straddles the late 1990s and early 2000s  new millenium in general  and Bethesda whose recent blockbuster titles are given greatest coverage If readers are confused regarding the dates they can just look inside the parentheses 19xx next to each game As for the console titles I think they should be handled separately as there was not a lot of crosspollination and most sources do as well My 2 cents  Â Talk
