Not True it wasnt me  Im not a wikipedia admin and therefore unable to block anyone  It appears youre editing without creating a user id and therefore you are sharing an AOL IP address with a user who is vandalizing wikipedia pages  I review the talk page for the IP address that created the above msg but I was unable to find a message from myself  Perphas you want to create a user id  Good Luck
