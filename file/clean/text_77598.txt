Should we make the same argument for those who selfidentify as Jews writing Holocaust articles  The only possible rationale I could see for prohibiting selfidentified pedophiles from writing articles on people claiming child abuse is that it provides right wing cranks with an opportunity to publicly attack Wikipedia  Given the collaborative process it certainly isnt going to make any difference in the quality of the resulting article and most minor attracted adults editing Wikipedia arent going to publicly announce their orientation anyway
