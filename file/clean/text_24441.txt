Those sources refer to ratings for Erin Burnetts ratings for her individual show  Yes they mention that ratings for other CNN programs are also low  I dont think thats relevant for this article but if you do include it

This ratings record she broke is certainly an important part of her career  It is the main noteworthy fact about her job which is the most important part of her life  A couple of you apparently are maintaining that info about Erin playing field hockey and lacrosse and a joke about camels she made are crucial info to this article but her show breaking a 20year ratings record is not important  Get real  Your judgement about relevance is obviously poor This info will stay in this article  Period
