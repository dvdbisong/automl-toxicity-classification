I strongly disagree Please point me to the part of WPCASTLIST which encourages quoting press releases let alone press releases which are just teasers as part of film advertising In my example above of Ford how is that helpful We could quote his wish that Han Solo had been killed off in episode 6 or how much he was paid but nooooooo thats in the sanitised press release Anyway I give up If a consensus wants a crappy article who am I to argue
