Thanks a lot  I hope its not too much trouble As to the Riksdag pictures dont delete them unless youre absolutely sure because freedom of information law should mean that they are free use at least free publication rather than modification or sale One last question if you create an image on Commons with the same name as an image in Wikipedia does the Commons image override and delete the Wikipedia one
