Hello  thanks very much for your post  The whole experience has not left me bitter as being so would mean that the trolls have won  I shant return in a hurry as real life is a bit hectic for me at work but I shall pop up towards George Robeys TFA to defend it against the vandals and POV pushers  Im glad you liked my work that means a lot coming from an editor such as yourself  I hope we can collaborate some day in the future talk
