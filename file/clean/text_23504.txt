Thanks for your contributions so far  You may be interested in creating a user account  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page WikipediaWhy_create_an_account3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes for one thing   

Good points and Ive created an account as you suggest See my notes below as well sg

In response to the commentary at the very very bottom of this page dupe social impacts Ive rearranged the content of the page a bit  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people definition effects diagnoses treatment broader issues

FYI I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read Societal Issues and moved it into the broader issues area  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the Effects category  After this edit Im going to go remove the original note of this because its no longer germain so youll have to look at the next edit in order to read it  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peeles perspective et al Im wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to excessive drinking whatever that is Alcoholism doesnt refer to someone who drinks a lot Many people drink a great deal but arent alcoholic Conversely many alcoholics dont drink very much at all compared against the general populations intake  

The section on terminology that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding  Since you seem to think its important Im putting it back in  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that weve had of late the entry is coming together nicely Im looking over the EFFECTS section which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself and the impact of alcohol USE It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery for example would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis This is similar of course to the situation with other diseases  the effects of diabetes when an individual has wellcontrolled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes Nevertheless I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article Can we build a consensus regarding this area  

 Alcoholism vs Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other What I found more confusing is that from alcohol abuse youre redirected to alcoholism

Alcoholism also known as alcohol dependence is a disease that includes four symptoms craving loss of control physical dependence and tolerance 

Moreover Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol loss of control over drinking or physical dependence etc etc

 Getting the facts  NIAAA

 

Response  Good point  From one interested perspective AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism 

I cant make the correction Im not that good informed and my english is quite lousy Could you  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction Correct me if Im wrong but alcohol is certainly a hard drug characterized by intense and possibly fatal withdrawals isnt that addiction

This is mostly true  The root
