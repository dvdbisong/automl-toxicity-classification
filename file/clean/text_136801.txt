Hi user Biatch got your message Victorian Rules or Aussie Rules or whatever it wants to call itself is not really seen as a native Australian game in New South Wales and does not exist to a huge extent outside the topdown I do not disparage AFL because it is a part of Australian culture I disparage because it is not part of my Australian culture up north and that whole reference is dodgy You could make just as much reference to the rugbythugby attitude that exists in Mebourne as cultural cringe  0425 8 December
