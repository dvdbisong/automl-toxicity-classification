Hi Marek69 Im in a situation of troublepeople telling me that Ive broken copyright even copying withing wikipedia I just need to get some things straight

 Firstly what do you have to do to attribute I read the page but it gave me wikipedia creep please simplify it
 What do you do if youve done edits way in the past in which youve copied from other wiki articles without attribution I only discovered it relatively recently
 Can you copy and paste info from other articles that youve written yourself

Please make this clear to me Ive been blocked in the past for a misunderstanding and I dont want to get blocked again

Please reply as soon as possible I need to go soon and I hope to have a reply soon Please reply
