This is very strange Despite good faith efforst of discussion asking open review and permission for changes someone comes and disrespectfully vandalises the edits by users in a wholesale arrogance Is this the open contribution philosophy of Wikipedia Please see below I am reposting my changes and please discuss what is not right or good about them before doing anything Thanks

Request of assistance for vandal user behaviour by Khoikhoi
Could the administation and users take an independent look for the following reversal of useful and pertinent contributions at the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk site please It is very difficult for me not to interpret the revision by Khoikhoi as disrespectful vandalism and disruptive behaviour More I studied his log history at various article related to the Turkish subjects and prior bans for the same disruptive behaviour more concerned I became Could someone help revert the edits he damaged and request him to be more respectful to others work Thank you
