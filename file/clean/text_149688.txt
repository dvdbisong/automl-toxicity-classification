The Lede altogether 
First of all let my say I apologize for what was described as an uncivil debate between the user Tippx and myself  Im willing to work this thing out like mature adults if he is  But the attitude of my way or the high way comes and its going to go nowhere and probably end the same 

First of all I have to say I agree 100 talk with your assessment of Currently the lede is too brief to do this job properly which perhaps gives the impression that mentioning the detainee incident so prominently is giving undue focus to one particular event  Thats exactly the impression I got  I felt Tippx was trying to put too much emphasizes on something controversial partly bc at the same time he insisted a couple facts in the Early Life section were overwhelmingly positive as he stated 
But forget the Early Life section for now 

Lets talk about improving the Lede section because I agree it does need improving Its just a bunch of short complete sentences Which is why if you look at my edited version I combined some to make it flow while also adding in diminutive additional facts but at the same time I didnt make one fact override the other  I listed basically the Key things about Wests career and that was it Nothing was more emphasized And I actually as you can see came to agree that Wests exit from the military did need to be mentioned but to a certain degree While that is a Key thing in Wests career its one of many I listed he won this past election but also lost his first election Listed after he retired the jobs he took up before his first bid for election And I did it all in chronological order
Felt it was balanced cited and edited well But ofcourse the user reverted it and his only explanation was a different one sounded better

But off of that and onto how we can get it right

First of all Ill be clear Its legitimate and cogent and Im going to insert back the fact that former Congressman Josiah Wall was the last black Florida Congressman and also the last EXACT YEAR is substituted for In November 2010 he was elected as the first AfricanAmerican Republican Congressman from Florida since the 1870s Its not that much more lengthy and listing the exact year and the last person who indeed was the last black Rep from Florida I feel does no harm and doesnt for a sec take a viewer completely out of the main subject And also justified to just say in the 2010 Midterm election rather than November 2010 Everyone knows our elections are in November but when a reader 15 years from now may be reading the fact it says midterms will immediately thwart the curiosity of whether this subjects election triumph was in a Presidential Election year or MidTerm year

And it also its rational to just put hes Republican Representativeelect rather than  Hes Representativeelect from Florida and the He is a member of the Republican Party Those can EASILY and rationally be combined No requisite for deliberation there

As far as what   and talk contribs say about the interrogation incident Qwurxian your statement of you cannot factually state that it was due to pressure that it was to preserve his benefits because he was afraid of being convicted or any other reason I guess one would feel we need an exact statement from Wests mouth as to EXACTLY WHY then OK I guess find a statement by him saying WHY but one would assume it was at least two if not all three of what you mentioned by simple coherence Well leave that open

And well leave else to be be dealt with 

And we can figure out how to combine and get the right Lede were looking for as well as anything else
