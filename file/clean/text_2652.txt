I understand your difficulty I am able to read some other language Wikis but I can not write an article for them On a different page  explained that a stamp article about Azerbaijan was deleted about a year ago I do not know what happened there exactly Do you know that there is a Wiki site where people can request translations Wikipedia articles from other languages into English If the article ruПочтовые марки и история почты Азербайджана is exactly what the English Wiki article is supposed to contain perhaps you could ask there for someone to translate it There is a small form to fill out there I can even do that for you if you tell me the article is exactly what is needed here I can not promise that anyone will translate it but we can ask Thank you again for your willingness to help
