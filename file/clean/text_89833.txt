PS I completely agree with you that Dixon is given too much space as an individual He belongs to a minority group but he is not a minority of one as the article suggests I did mention Lyle Campbell who is a respected scholar not an Australianist true enough but competent enough to judge whether the material presented is sufficient The article might mention this that Dixon is not alone although he may be the most influential of the minority After all The Cambridge Language Surveys had him as sole composer of one of their books and coeditor of another It is therefore not smart to accuse him of ignorance in his own field Alles Liebe
