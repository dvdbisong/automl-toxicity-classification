JanetteDoe I appreciate your finding and uploading the Rao articles  However this can easily become an endless discussion  For some other Yadavapologist will soon come along and find an even more obscure source than Rao and then youconscientious and rigorous to a degree that the Yadav apologists are not and have no intention aware or unaware of beingwill go scurrying again for the article  After that we all will try to interpret it weighing the pros and cons again to a degree the apologists will not for they will be busy looking for the next roadblock to toss in our path  

I think we cant make the determination of whether Rao applies here or not at least not yet  Let the secondary sources do that  We need to rely on recent scholarship especially that in textbooks published by academic presses and vetted both before and after publication by reviewers from a wide range of scholarly and journalistic backgrounds  Two such books by Susan Bayly and Christophe Jaffrelot both widely used in universities around the world both reviewed extensively in the literature are being used in the article  Let the article writing or rewriting proceed based on these or similar books  Once the article has been fleshed out we can come back to the issue of Rao  Otherwise nothing will get done and those of us whove taken time out from our other Wikipedia not to speak RL pursuits to attend to the article will slowly walk away out of touch and out of sympathy  Talk
