Thanks Avruch thats exactly the point I was trying to make in the RfC Would it be possible to ask Elonka to address directly the criticisms and answer them rather than question the credibility of the critics That may go a long way towards helping some resolution of the RfC as it currently comes across as a dialogue de sourds not sure what the right English expression would be transliterates as deaf people having a conversation
