GTBacchus that is an excellent idea Indeed the sources are available as we have both noted in the Dresden Firebombing Wikipaedia page so theres no real dispute about their availability and relevance The WPRSs are there for editors to assess in the wikilink provided
I would have edited the main page myself but I know from experience how territorial some editors are over their favourite pages and WP policy requires some degree of notification and consensus building before making signficant changes to an article Given the sensitive nature of War Crimes I imagine that every edit is controversial When I raised this topic I assumed that this rather obvious ground had been covered and ironically thought I would avoid treading on some toes by asking why the Dresden Firebombing wasnt in the main article lol
GTBacchus may I ask you to make to appropriate changes As it appears that Jrtaylorivs concerted read obsessive campaign to have me removed from Wikipaedia is about to reach its conclusion
