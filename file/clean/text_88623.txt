You really do not understand

1The question is why the symbols must be removed from the infobox

2They MAY be still valid What we have until now and nobody can find more evidences is that law of 1962 The last law that deals SPECIFICALLY with the topic is the one to be followed It doesnt matter if this law is from the time of Cleopatra It doesnt matter if its a colonial symbol

3There are many examples throughout history New York city Jakarta SÃ£o Paulo city Rio de Janeiro city and many other cities used their colonial symbols until a new law dealing with the subject was created Some even maintained their colonial symbols like New York and Rio Thats a heraldry principle

4What we can do is to put a tag or something saying MAYBE STILL IN USE If there is no newer law dealing with the symbols of Dili YES THEY ARE VALID NOWADAYS as strange as it can be

5If they belong to the colonial times why we have a photo of 1991 with Ramos Horta holding the flag of an occupied territory that is struggling with invasion and doesnt want to be a colony again
