Editor Assistance  Requests 

A few moments ago I reported Wildhartlivies alleged vandalism to the forum titled Editor Assistance  Requests  Wildhartlivie constantly threatens to suspend me so I am making a preemptive strike against him  her doing it again  I kept my request short and sweet but I was sure to include Wildhartlivies outrageous ignorant claim that police who investigated the Kupcinet case indulged in gossip  The article has two sources that indicate it was a county sheriffs case not a police case  And Wildhartlivie does not back up his  her claim that the police were gossiping as opposed to doing their jobs  Think twice before you believe everything Wildhartlivie says about the Karyn Kupcinet article  Dont let this unstable Wikipedia contributor revert your edits After all the garbage spouted by this person he  she and I could be the only people still reading this page  Lets see if anyone other than the two of us are still here  If this paragraph warrants a reply from Wildhartlivie and nobody else that is a bad sign
