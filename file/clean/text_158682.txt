Well anything that was massive I think that we should cover  Im hoping to get one of our best experts on that here Fifelfoo to start writing stuff         My comment was not a complaint about the article nor really proposing any big changes  It was more just a little towards our multiyear effort at figuring out how to cover this topic that deals with the main issues that have ben raised   I do plan to develop a few sentence paragraph on the 20 million vague libertarians which I have found sources for  Ive been slow in doing that  Sincerely North8000
