Section Missing 

There is a section missing in this article referring to the major private health insurance companies in Australia their histories corporate data and statistics on membership plus some discussion about the competitive corporate environment in the Australian Private Health Care Sector For example what is Bupa What happened to MBF This must be an interesting sequence of events but we dont know the saga so our readers are missing out up till now Demographic and geographic data about Private Health fund coverage in this article would be very useful indeed
