re I thought he was kind of a dick yesterday 

Well maybe The page was created a joke see the edit summary of the page creation for instance and while we dont have a CSD criteria for joke its reasonable to treat trollery as tests A page created to test Wikipedia functions in this case to test the deletion process itself It could reasonably have been nominated as vandalism or as a hoax or in this case and if you wanted to take it seriously as an attack page So thats four criteria right there But its not really exactly any of these things so

I dont know We used to have BJAODN but since thats not allowed anymore theres no real fun in running these through AfD so they should probably just be hoovered up But whatever
