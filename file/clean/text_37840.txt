Their was no disambiguation when i changed it to British India no disambiguation when i changed it to Karachi Sindh nor is their a disambiguation while i am writing this It still links to ROI Note i didnt change Indian Muslim as the disambiguation was provided As for Sanjay Khan and the Hindu community i didint insult them i just stated a fact that he would not be accepted as a pathan If you dont believe me thats your problem I suggest asking a pathan Basically you didnt like the fact that i changed Jinnahs birthplace so you made up a reason to block me Dont block me in the future without a just reason
