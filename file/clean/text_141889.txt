The World Tomorrow wiki update 

Mike

No matter how much you may desire to make it so The World Tomorrow program is not defunct so please stop removing and replacing my updated information by overriding it with your outdated information  The rights to The World Tomorrow broadcast were obtained by The Church of God Worldwide Ministries of Sevierville Tennessee through the UNITED STATES PATENT and TRADEMARK office and the program is in CURRENT production

For verification please feel free to contact the office of attorneys Alston and Bird in Washington DC and speak with my good friend Pia Pyle  executive assistant to former US Senator Bob Dole  Bob is special counsel at the firm

Moreover I am one of the new presenters of The World Tomorrow broadcast
