Because the image is misleading and it is completely biased This is an encylcopedia  it has to be FAIR So lets change the setting a little bit If we had no photos of the twin towers collapsing on 911 should we put a picture up of the US in Afghanistan To someone who was not fully aware about the conflict they would assume that the conflict is about the Americans attacking Afghanistan The pictures need to be as neutral and FAIR as possible Because the average Joe does not read everything And dont hold a double standard against Israel
