Quoting from the rules

Dealing with misuse of process

Unlike trolls who vandalize articles the majority of the damage caused by those misusing process is indirect Generally it is best to simply state your opposition and leave it at that 

In many cases someone else has already gone through an explanation and you can simply say you agree If a nomination or listing is obviously going to fail piling on explanation after explanation or personally attacking the nominator is not going to change anything the listing or nomination will fail anyway 

If the number of listings starts getting excessive even if they are on separate pages then you might want to use the dispute resolution process Dispute resolution does take a while though If the number of nominationslisting is very high the most damage will be done if there is no emergency block put in place In general let the process run 

Given the conversation in the ANI was about me and I was commmenting and responding to the ANI on this page quoting it
was the reasonable thing to do
