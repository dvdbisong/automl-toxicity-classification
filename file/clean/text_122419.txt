Interestingif you denounce his behavior why even leave the message you did If you realize it was part of a larger issue why not simply either decline to comment or leave remarks on the RfC noting you have also observed his inappropriate behavior as you noted on his own talk page as well Your message instead did nothing to help his case either As for loony warning messages there was nothing loony about it You seemed to be asking for a civility warning for calling me a Nazi so I just gave you what you asked for None of this has any affect on Abtracts case at all I simply responded to your insult on my talk page with the warning you asked for  Collectonian talk  contribs
