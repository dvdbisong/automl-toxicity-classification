your unidentified flowers 

I collect very different and interesting plants I dont really have any flowers however my mother keeps a garden 

Your Number six is definately a Daffodil and number one and seven are probably Daffodils too The taxonomy of Daffodils is quite large but they are all of the Narcissus family Number 8 also could be a Narcissus hybrid Number two is definately a type of violet viola genus the common violet is viola papilionacea but yours is too blue Number 5 is prolly a forgetmenot myosotis scorpioides  Number nine is a wild pansy Viola tricolor My mother thinks the number three is a clematis but no confirmation is possible We dont have any idea what the number 4 is 

I realize that you are on indefinite vacation but should you return this will be here I might also break down and categorize your pictures
