David Swanson a Washington Democratic activist working to persuade Congress to pursue an inquiry into the memo said the documents timing and the UN resolution calling for Saddam to disarm do not disprove the memos contents

I am not sure what point they thought they were making said Swanson the cofounder of wwwafterdowningstreetorg These minutes mesh perfectly with a building pile of evidence including testimony from former administration officials and if thats going to be a matter of sheer coincidence we need an explanation of why

Behavioral scientists have identified many powerful factors that drive us to war  factors so numerous and so compelling that its hard to imagine how well ever overcome them Evolution seems to have equipped us  men especially  with strong tendencies to organize and kill As General John J Pershing stated Men go to war because they enjoy it Like many mammals we also possess the natural tendency to protect our territory Society is capable of suppressing genetically based tendencies but when it comes to war most cultures actually fuel the flames We deliberately instill nationalistic pride in our children and we teach them to assume roles and follow orders  all characteristics of the good soldier In addition we deindividuate people by giving them uniforms we diffuse responsibility by having them use weapons in teams we dehumanize enemies by labeling them heathens animals and so on Throw in financial incentives some propaganda and a charismatic leader or two and we become more antlike than ever
