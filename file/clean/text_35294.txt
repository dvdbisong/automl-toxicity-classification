Thanks for the civil explaination youre probably the least belligerant editor Ive crossed at somepoint  I do have an account UserEganjt but I access wikipedia from work and dont bother to log in most of the time  Actually Ive gone ahead and asked that Sinebot not sign for me and I plan to use the IP address for most of my wikipedia browsing  I like helping out but the formatting is hard for me to remember and there seems to be a lot of squabbling between editors  Thanks for explainations and Ill be sure to keep on helping out just within the rules
