We have more than 2000 articles not assessed Isnt that bad
 
This is in comparision to

from WikipediaWikiProject_Molecular_and_Cellular_Biology  

 My contributions 

I have contributed to this project by Sill_Plate Platform_framing and many more edits in other articles  

 More wikiprojects 

If we make more and more wikiprojects it will end up here

httpenwikipediaorgwikiCategoryInactive_WikiProjects

But I am very interested in creating a wikiProject that deals with creating articles regarding the companies that supply construction products  materials However creating an assesment box like the one above is very hard

For example the WikipediaWikiProject_Urban_studies_and_planning doesnt have an assesment box

I recently was involved in creating the wikiproject Dentistry Assesment box see here httpenwikipediaorgwikiUser_talkDozenistBot_to_update_articles3F

 

Furthermore the bigger and more organized the project is it can bring so many articles to FA status and lots of main page attention Have you noticed recently that in every few days there is an article on the main page which is related to India WikipediaWikiProject_India Plus in their project they have admin participants
