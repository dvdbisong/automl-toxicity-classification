James C Coyle Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver Colorado 

Fred Bauder Pro Se 

Crestone Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board The board and the panel recommended that the respondent Fred Bauder be suspended for thirty days be required to petition for reinstatement and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law We accept the recommendation 

I 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976 He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted See CRCP 24113b People v Paulson  930 P2d 582 582 Colo 1997 Based on the default and the evidence presented the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence 

On July 14 1997 we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client See People v Bauder  941 P2d 282 283 Colo 1997 Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of 205897 within thirty days of the date on the opinion See id at 28384 He did not pay the costs as ordered however or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order Moreover Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order As a result a request for investigation was filed against him Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo RPC 34c and that his conduct also violated Colo RPC 84d engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and CRCP 24167 failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation 

II 

The hearing panel approved the boards recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days be required to petition for reinstatement and as a further condition of reinstatement demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 1991  Supp 1992 ABA Standards  suspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding ABA Standards 622 However disbarment is warranted when a lawyer a intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client the public the legal system or the profession Id at 81a 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline See id at 922a Other aggravating factors include Bauders refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct see id at 922g his substantial experience in the practice of law see id at 922i and his indifference to making restitution see id at 922j Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence no mitigating factors were found 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings We elect to accept the boards recommendation See People v Rishel  956 P2d 542 544 Colo 1998 We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public Accordingly we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel One member of the court however would impose more severe discipline 

III 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion It is further ordered
