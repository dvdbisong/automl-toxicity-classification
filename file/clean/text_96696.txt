If you look at Wikipedia Bosanski only latin is used Whether it be fr pratical reasons or not This does go along with my point that latin is used MOSTLY Almost always If cyrillic was really official like it is in Serbia then the Bosnian Wikipedia would be both in cyrillic and latin like the Serbian Wikipedia it is in both The Bosnian Wikipedia says that it uses the latin script for pratical reasons such as people do not have the cyrillic keyboard etc Well this goes along with my point that it is not used as much People do not have cyrillic keyboards like the people in Serbia

Offical newspapers in Bosnia are not in cyrillic They are in latin Slobodna Bosna Oslobodjenje Ljiljan Nezavisne Novine For all ethnicities neither are their websites Cyrillic is most commonly used in Serbia

How are you going to use a Wikipedia Article to prove your point Now where does it say that it is 100 correct I had problems with the German Wikipedia on Bosanska Dubica they claimed that Hrvatska Dubica and Bosanska Dubica were the same townmunicipality This is just crazy Anyways I will never understand why people who have no clue about where Dubica is or have never before heard about the town write about it My point is that people can write things on a biased level They showed me websites as proof but websites cannot be used as refrences in the United States for grammar school projects Websites can never be trusted

I mentioned this before wwwgoogleba uses Bosnian and Croatian in latin but if you want to search googleba in cyrillic then you have to click Serbian to search googleba in cyrillic

I also looked at several different translation websites and found that if you want to translate into Bosnian then you are translating into latin Bosnian However for Serbian it gives you an option latin or cyrillic

In the world Bosnian is viewed by Bosnians and by the rest of the world as using the latin script

Then explain to me why the Serbian template does not have latin and cyrillic 

I would have to say that only SrpskoHrvatski should have both but the languages that have split from Yugoslavia should be chosen by its users If you want to changed the Bosnian template than use it Please do not change something you do not feel represented by

The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the three languages Bosnian Croatian Serbian Serbian is the one that uses cyrillic and that is how it is offical in Bosnia The Bosnian language does not tend to use cyrillic
