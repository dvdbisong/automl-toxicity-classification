I have not purposely removed any sourced material on this page I apologized when I did so by accident I corrected some poorly sourced info the Intrafada material On the other hand you have repeatedly removed sourced material The IBC chart the Amira Hass info etc Without apologies at all In fact you do it defiantly and with prejudice and while removing totally uncontroversial minor edits too as in your last revert You even reverted updated Palestine Red Crescent Society stats A source you approve In your zeal to mass revert you are destroying collaboration on this page and scaring off excellent editors such as the creator of the IBC chart WikipediaAssume good faith says 
This guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary
