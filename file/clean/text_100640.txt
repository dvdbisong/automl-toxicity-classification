FALSE Whoever wrote them is making up quotes facts and references For example I couldnt find ANY information on the existence of The Children Computer biweekly times Also the quote The New York entertainment weekly stats that it is safer then club penguin but way more boring cannot be found on the page referenced That referenced article just discusses a Sears Ad Campaign and doesnt review any games Therefore I deleted these criticism due to them being purely false and opinions of some disgruntled user If there is negative criticism about Poptropica that is fine but they should be real and correctly referenced   1449 28 August 2008
