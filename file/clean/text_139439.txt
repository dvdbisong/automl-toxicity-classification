Hypocrisy on Wikipedia
Lately Ive been busy on the Jesse Jackson article on Wikipedia trying to put in a ridiculous quote of his into the article yet Ive been repeatedly told that that violates NPOV even though the quote is cited Yet from reading this article on Savage I see that the liberals have had a field day in printing negative stuff about Savage A few weeks ago when I tried to take some of the stuff out I was told Tough If its cited theres nothing that you can do about it I think that all of you guys who put negative stuff into this article should be helping me get that particular quote into the Jesse Jackson article or can only negative stuff about conservatives be written on Wikipedia
