Songs Christy has written

Does anybody have a list of them Who wrote natives and what inspired it Its a very powerful song A touch of a strangers hand innocence turns to shame I went looking for Before the Deluge on YouTube and up came Jackson Browne There are a lot of his songs influenced by American folk most especially the great Prosperous which had a very strong Woody Guthrie influence So I suppose Im wondering what songs Christy has written himself Anybody 864271111
