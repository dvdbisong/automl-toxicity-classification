Answer to Mütze
Well I am surprised to see that I am unblocked At least you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons

Mütze I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot Of course what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one Here is what you did You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page
Very soon this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way otherwise the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me  considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article

As you clearly told me yourself you did not want my article to be published This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward That is what I believe you did And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia

Now what is your role at Wikipedia You are not an administrator otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly

Anyway I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article I am ready to change sentences that cause problems It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed it will be changed I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences not emotions If I do not want to change a sentence I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings Mütze

So I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do The goal publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it Apparently for the time being mostly the group of administrators and their friends  who are the only ones who complained about my article so far

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way Just a few days ago I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page
Newcomers are always to be welcomed There must be no cabal there must be no elites there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia he would not be very pleased What I say above he call it one of his main principles

So administrators when you contact people make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively

So I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic Then I will do my best to change them to please everybody
