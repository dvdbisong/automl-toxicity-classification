Josephine Baker 

Id like to ask that you review the talk portion of the sexuality section on Josephine Bakers page My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable For example he states at the beginning that he hated her and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30 The blanket statement Baker was bisexual written as if it indisputable really has to go dont you think There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity Doesnt this kind of TMZ gossip presented as fact diminish the biographies of people who have the courage to acknowledge their sexuality up front209212567
