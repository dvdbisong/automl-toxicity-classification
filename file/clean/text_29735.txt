Bands in the Thunderbirds video
As a general point itd be handy if you could actually keep your comments on my talk page rather than removing them after they were added I have no objection to them being there and it serves as a useful reference that later on I can look and say Oh yes thats right Ariem told me suchandsuch without needing to hunt through the page history for deleted comments You can obviously do whatever you want with my comment here but Id prefer anything on my page to stay there

More importantly do we actually have a name here or there which could be googled or wikid in order to confirm that there are indeed real bands in the video  1040 19 Dec 2004 UTC
