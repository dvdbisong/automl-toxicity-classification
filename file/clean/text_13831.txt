I dismiss your RfC
I dismiss your RfC as nothing but harassment pure and simple Why do you hate religion Am I not allowed to edit on Wikipedia because I am not a radical secularist I point out that your stereotypes about Evangelicals dont apply to everyone and what do you do you remove it Am I supposed to stop being an Orthodox Catholic to edit Wikipedia Or do you have to be a committed atheist to be credible It seems that you arent interested in discussing the issues from an uninvolved thirdperson perspective but instead it seems you use Wikipedia to grind an axe against Christianity
How can you say that the crop of articles your work on are neutral when there are many inaccuracies and stereotypes etc about politically active Christians found within 
Christian Reconstructionism is an outgrowth of Calvinist theology plain an simple How can you say that I am POV pushing
Does NPOV equal secular Leftism The Dominionism article is heavily slanted to the Left politically and I havent violated any rules by posting a POV tag there Much of what I have read form people such as Yurica Bokaer etc is nothing but guilt by association
The edit warring has come from your side from the beginning Chip Berlet is a political operative who isnt schooled in theology and his observations paint with a broad brush lacking historical insights into Christian views on Church and State This isnt a personal attack There shouldnt be a pro or an antiDominionist bias Your stated commitment to paint Dominionism as a threat is hardly NPOV
