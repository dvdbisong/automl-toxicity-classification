be virtually impossible for our website to explain the broad range of fields required to build a DSP Loudspeaker  I my self used Wikipedia during the initial development of our current model  Please note that a notation of rogue wave audio exists in the list of loudspeaker manufacturers and for the initial page setup I used the other manufacturers article pages as a guide and I do not mention product as many of the others do instead my page was developing as a multidisipline educational article that used Wikipedia to cover current research and concepts in electronics mechanics acoustic physics As well as our own developments  I believe the article page had an issue with my username company name and external links  Once the article page was complete my intension is to have a link on our website to the article in Wikipedia so that people could do guided research on the topics I had to learn to build them
