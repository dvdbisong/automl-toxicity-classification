Gentle request 

Please dont take this in the wrong spirit Ozzie but I do really think you need to consult WPREDACT and act on it If you think about it for a moment its not too hard to see how substantially altering the content of ones own talkpage comments after other users already responded to the original comment can be confusing potentially misleading and generally annoying to fellow contributors Please understand that Im not trying to pick a fight in any way Cheers 10915560103
