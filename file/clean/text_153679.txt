I cant defend the vandal so to speak but this article has problems  The first line refers to neofuturism as a 21st century movement and yet the gallery has many structures that were done during the 20th  The St Louis Gateway Arch for instance is OLD  I was brought here by the article of Buckminster Fuller and he died in 1983  If you cant tell us what century something is from this does create a credibility problem  Also and this is just personal musing the nomenclature is problematic and recursive  How many times are we going to reinvent futurism  If I built a building today and designed it to look as futuristic as possible would that be neoneofuturism
