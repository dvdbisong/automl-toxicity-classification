Problem in gallery and request for this article to be moved 

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true Ferodwsi was born in Iran therefore he could not have been Tajik Secondly Rabia Balkhi was of Arab descent therefore she could not have been of Tajik descent either Lastly why is Muhammad of Ghori included in the gallery of Tajiks He was not Taik the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves with no evidence being provided I also request the Tajik article to be removed to the Persian People article as a subcategory to erase confusion of Tajiks being a separate group
