Userbox
Hi

Strangely someone deleted a userbox of yours as T1 even though it was userfied  I assume this was a simple mistake on the part of the deleter so Ive restored it for you  Best wishes  

Actually I was unaware the thing was already at DRV when I undeleted  Technically one probably should wait to undelete until the DRV is over so I unintentionally goofed a bit  Still the deletion was clearly a mistake in process and content which is quite mild  Looking at the RfC and DRV I dont see that Dmcdevit has defended it at all so Ill continue to assume he was simply confused

Although I understand your unhappiness your RfC is a little bit premature  one speedy deletion can be a simple mistake which everybody makes  A pattern of bad choices and an unwillingness to reconsider them would be required to initiate an RfC really  Dmcdevit is a very nice person  even if he wasnt mistaken in the deletion and genuinely had a problem with the userbox he isnt the type to object to taking the debate to MfD the proper forum at the very least

Thanks for the kind words  Ive been offwiki for a bit but Ill be getting around to my old beat soon which includes DRV normally so should you have other problems Ill be happy to help  Best wishes  

On looking at the DRV again I do notice Dmcdevit there and he isnt arguing a sound position although he is being civil  Surprising I must say  Anyway I hope hes just having bad day Ive probably been grumpy myself lately what with the flu the snow the relatives etc   

 last word in 

The first question you need to ask yourself is do I have a history perhaps as yet unadmitted of being overly critical of myself If the answer to this might be yes then you cant always trust your own tendency to selfcriticize because your subconscious motivation is not selfimprovement but selfdenigration dont pay that too much heed then If however the answer is no then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you listen to the notice and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively You might be doing that and you might do well to listen but its hard for me to weigh this As for my own opinion looking at WikipediaCategories for deletionLog2006 December 11Abortion you havent added anything that was redundant so I wouldnt say its an issue If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that youve already answered remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if youve already answered a repeated objection Then its a question of how much faith you have in the admins I know Im treading on very thin ice now For instance I made sure to answer everything at WikipediaArticles for deletionFaith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted I couldnt blame myself for not trying everything Im likely to do the same thing at WikipediaDeletion reviewLog2006 December 5Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations Ive dug up But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80 of the votes are keep it will probably be kept even though its not a vote If its less than 80 then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD keepers had about 66 and we just barely came through with no consensus I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreaders and my arguements as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines

Hope all that helps Â  talk  

 Why Assume good faith and assume again
