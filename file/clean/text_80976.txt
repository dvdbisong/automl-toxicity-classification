It probably couldnt hurt to start a discussion I wouldnt see this as a big deal except that the  template doesnt do the best job of explaining what its classification of the article means As far as I can see the template refers only to the position of the article link on the WPGA page and this is not a formal declaration of exactly where the article fits within the organization of all human knowledge However we might as well try to put the peak oil article link in the GA page location that makes the most sense
