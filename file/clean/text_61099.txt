A Frank Apology 

I would like briefly apologise to my disgusting and unwarranted vendetta against you I deeply regret and am greatly ashamed by my abhorrent actions and comments and I assure you they will never occur in any form

Again I am sorry and apologise for all the offence and disruption which ensued my actions

To ensure this does not reoccur I promise to avoid this talk in future and that you shall never hear from me again

Sorry
