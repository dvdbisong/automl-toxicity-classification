George Bush 

Please look at the edits being made about The Decider in George Bush  Can you come to a decision for this section

I believe that the information about The Decider is important and should be added  It has to do with how he is viewed in society  

Please insert my previous information and inform the other editor not to remove such information

I do not intend on continuing an editing war but I do want the correct information to be present in the article

Thank you
