This Users Abuse of his Admin status deliberate posting of proven misinformation

According to WPLINKSTOAVOID article 2 Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research cannot be included in wikipedia  has purposefully breached this policy in his continuing personal vendetta against me Here is the proof

After repeatedly being warned by myself against the misleading and factually inaccurate material presented on an external webpage Janet Marlows site admin  still intentionally linked to this misinformative page in the following edit 

 

 has since made the above statement there is no misinformation on the particular page to which I linked Both sides are describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings Whether that is four resonances or eight is a nonissue

Not only is  mistaken in claiming that there is no misinformation on the page or that the two sides in the argument are describing the same thing he has clearly been abusing his status as an administrator Let us first consider the contents of this argument

The page to which  linked makes the following claims

Therefore there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar If you play a C  Bb Ab and Gb on the first string E  there will be less sustain from these notes than the others because there are no sympathetic resonant strings This was Maestro Yepes primary reason for conceiving the tenstring guitar By adding these pitches in four extra bass strings now provides each half step with the sympathetic resonance making a more physically completed instrument Janet Marlow Janet Marlows site

Now in western classical music there are 12 notes in the octave C C D D E F F G G A A B If it is claimed as above that four of these notes lack resonances then logicallymathematically this means that the other eight out of the twelve do not lack resonances Marlow lists the four missing resonances as C Bb A Ab G and Gb F and states that there will be less sustain from these notes than the others Any person who is a competent speaker of the English language will understand this as meaning that these four listed notes have more sustain more resonance than the other notes the other notes being C D D E F G A B In other words Marlow is claiming four notes dont have resonance and eight do

However Narciso Yepes who invented the modern 10string guitar always ubiquitously and verifiably talked about eight missing sympathetic resonances on the guitar not four as claimed by Marlow Yepes lists the eight missing resonances as C C Db D Eb F F Gb G G Ab A Bb He lists the other four notes that do have resonance as D A E and B Yepess quotes from numerous articlesinterviews can be read here  with references to follow them up There is also further information on my site wwwtenstringguitarINFO about the acoustics the science behind Yepess statements

Janet Marlow and  are clearly in fact not saying the same thing as Narciso Yepes and Viktor van Niekerk Both sides are certainly not describing the same eight notes being provided by the same four resonant strings as  is falsely claiming If they were describing the same thing Marlow would have to speak of eight missing resonances C Db Eb F Gb G Ab Bb not only four C Bb Ab Gb

 only goes on to claim that Whether that is four resonances or eight is a nonissue because to admit the truth  that it is very much an issue and a source of misinformation  would reveal his involvement in not only deliberately promoting misinformation on wikipedia going against WPLINKSTOAVOID article 2 but also misusing his status as an administrator to abuse me in his ongoing personal vendetta over an edit disagreement This defamatory conduct includes but is hardly limited to his claim below that Janet Marlow is a more authoritative figure than Viktor despite the fact that Marlow has been proven to publish misinformation while my website wwwtenstringguitarINFO is presently the only online resource that faithfully represents Narciso Yepess statements about his invention as well as a scholarly explanation of the
