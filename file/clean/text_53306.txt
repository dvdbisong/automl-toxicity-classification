Origin 
The evidence presented by the following paragraph does not convince me of the relation between the Orkhon script and the Rovás Ive heard that conclusion elsewhere and Im not necessarily doubting it but I just dont see proof from the arguments made here
Around 600 AD the yet illiterate Hungarian tribes moved southwest from their earlier territories to the coastal region of the Eastern Black Sea The Hungarian Runes are almost certainly related to the Orkhon or Turkic Runic script 

Says who 

This is supported by the Hungarian tribes early geography propinquity Is this supposed to be proximity to the Göktürks

So what At various times in history they were near Germanic Slavic Turkic Mongolic and maybe Greek peoples It doesnt follow from the evidence presented that the Turkic influence was the source of the writing

Moreover thirteen of the Hungarian rovás glyphs closely resemble characters of the Orkhon script

Which ones I dont count 13 convergences I see a lot of resemblance in overall appearance between Futhark and Rovás they seem to show a greater resemblance to each other than with Orkhon Some prominent features of the Orkhon script are absent in Rovás eg reduplicated characters and the use of dots or other small characters detached from the main sign

Im not arguing that German Runes and Rovás are necessarily closely related its just that the evidence presented by this section of this article is hardly convincing If someone can correct this please do
