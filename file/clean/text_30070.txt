The term pharaoh
Hey while reading the reviewers comment on Khufu I saw you response regarding the term pharaoh Respond This form was choosed cuz Egyptologists today prefer to say king before pharaoh since the latter term is of greek origin and brought up in greekroman epoquesNephiliskos talk 
Well this is not true The term pharaoh is not of greek origin but of egyptian origin pr3ÀÅ peraa meaning the great house The term in fact refers to the palace of the king and came to used for the kings estate and finally for the king himself during the Saite period ca 650BC well before the classical grecoroman times starting ca 500BC Thus the term pharaoh was used by ancient egyptian to refer to their king albeit at a very point moment in history Furthermore not so many scholar are against the use of pharaoh which is in fact the standard English term to refer to the ancient Egyptian kings Thus I would strongly advise you to king the term pharaoh throughout the article
