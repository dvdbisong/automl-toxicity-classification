A sound new policy

An island cannot be a nationculturestate in itself nor inherently owned by anyone Im afraid it is simply fascistic to claim land in this way  let alone abuse powers to enforce it When another nation covers part of the island in this case the United Kingdom it makes it doubly wrong Wikipedia needs a clear policy to stop nations from claiming a land article especially when they already have an official article One each you greedy scoundrels  one each If you are really into history organise it like everyone else Historical era articles simply must be subsets of the official nation article 

I cannot stress this enough Wikipedia should NEVER assert that any nation is a land however long a nation has been associated with it Read the papers  read about Europe Read about the blood shed  read about the world We simply cannot let this be done But has anyone got the guts to address policy I wonder

Wikipedia uber alles I dont think so Wikimedia ironically owns nothing but its ventures and this inherently rightwing anarchy Wikipedia is destined to ultimately fall If it has sense and value it will adapt and change instead
 
Id be obliged if people leave my talk page in peace now Im switching off my email too  it was only open for another issue   

PS last one Of course the word country can mean countryside in an emotive sense  but that cannot be a definition regarding groups of people on Wikipedia The Wikipedia top list should be List of countries Sovereign statesNationsTribes Country should always be used as the disambiguator Noone gets pushed out of the whole structure then as they do now and they are all admitted to be countryconnected in some way  but is doesnt include any land masses Footnotes can be made for cases if needed  it simply wont be messier than it is now far from it 

People need to take up the mantle on all of this There are many people on Wikipedia trying to engineer the identity mess on Wikipedia to support their nationalistic views At its most negative this is often a comparative matter for them  so they often go after other casescauses more than directly push their own The two Irelands and the very specific constituent countries of the United Kingdom are always on their radar and this crazy disruption over the Irelands now has made them stronger without doubt A quick glance at my 700 page watchlist confims that Logical consistency leads to stability anarchy like we have now leads to disruption
