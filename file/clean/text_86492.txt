I intended to suggest a preference for leaving it out whether or not that was clear so long as the material is put back in the Family Education and Career section  That seems at the least to be capable of garnering consensus  Im not entirely comfortable with the word idenitifying otherwise as it suggests that they are identifying him as part of this debate  That is  why I left it out in the first place since it isnt an appropriate comment on the debate and doesnt provide new information  otherwise I dont think we should give the false impression that people are making an issue of this when they arent or giving excessive or repetitive focus to the issue in parts of his biography where the reliable sources dont support it  If I read all of this correctly though the simplest answer seems still to take the whole sentence out and put the paragraph back in the section on Family Education and Career
