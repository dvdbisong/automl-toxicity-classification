Houghton Hampshire 

Hello there I have had a look at your contributions on Houghton and wanted to let you know that you had done a good job and creating and expanding the article although it had a lot of problems with it at the start I have Wikified the article gave it a cleanup and rearranged the lead section In short I have cleaned it up although there still are some problems left with it If you are unsure on how to write about a lead section please refer to WPLEAD Also external links should never have any removed commercial sites per WPELNO This also means that we would need a little proof on the basis of the article per WPV in other words we need inline citations for proof If in doubt you can always contact me on my talk page Thank you
