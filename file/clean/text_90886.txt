Negative POV  
This seems to be written to strongly criticise the company AFAIK printing and selling Wikipedia articles in book form is a useful service eg for African schools and universities who might now have sufficient net access and Wikipedia encourages such services from private companies to extend the readership of its Creative Commons articles   Its a similar model to making money by copying and selling tapes and CDs of GNU software which was how GNU used to make its money in the days of tapes and Linux magazines selling cover discs   Im not affillated with the company btw
