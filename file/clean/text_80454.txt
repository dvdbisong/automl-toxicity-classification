Years ago I was on one of those old ships USS Rankin AKA103 I wrote an article about her then branched into other similar ships plus ships built at the same place as she was I finished that project and havent done any more but there are many of them waiting to be done The basic material is at DANFS so you can do an article fairly quickly Theres a LOT of Wikification to be done on them as well as polishing up the DANFS language Plus you learn about history and exotic locations Hundreds of APAs attack transports are out there waiting to be put on Wikipedia If I get the new article bug Ill probably start on them one day
