Italics
Hi there Ive been coming across your recent contributions on plant species Good work so far I see one of the references youre using is from Timber Press  Ive adored that publisher for quite some time and they have quite a bit of my money Anyway I was wondering if you could pay close attention to italicization of species and genera when you write your articles it would be a big help Thanks Cheers   
Oops sorry one more thing Also kindly watch the overlinking Ive counted at least three links to genus in the same paragraph The first mention of the term is all that requires linking Cheers   

 Thank you 

for clarifying when the ceasefire was first broken
