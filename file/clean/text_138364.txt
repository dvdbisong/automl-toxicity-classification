Anonymous in relation to Prject Chanology versus unrelated Anon 

I think that the article is starting to show its age  Project Chanology is now a very minor movement within anon openly ridiculed by the majority  The article should be edited to show what Anonymous has done since Chanology as it has been more than a year since Chanology was a central feature of Anonymous  As is often the problem with internet subcultures Anonymous has evolved quicker than the wikipedia page on it and no longer resembles the information included here
