Kangju
Hi Thomas Thank you for your note on the Kangju I agree with you this article badly needs some work done on it The Kangju were an important group in the history of the region and the development of the early Silk Routes and deserve much more attention in the Wikipedia I was really just trying to fix the immediate problem today I will try to get back to it soon  I do have quite a large number of references to hand which should help me flesh it out The problem is that I am a bit sick at the moment  so I may be a few days If you dont see anything done in a week or so  please dont hesitate to give me a reminder and a nudge on my Talk Page Cheers and best wishes
