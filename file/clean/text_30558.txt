Sorry it seems I walked on your feet If you really want the move please do it I will no longer interfere

BTW to copy pages and preserve their formatting I suggest you do this
 edit the page
 copy the text in the edit form
 edit the new page
 paste the copied text in the edit form

To see the ingoing links you need to correct click on What links here at the bottom of a page
