TRENT REZNOR 

So the lead singer and basicaly the entire band is made up of MrMichael Trent Reznor My role model complete genius if you ask me i adore him and his music with the emotion and the power his songs contain i can relate to what hes saying and why he says what he sings i am a female and i love him music he has made me look at music in a n entirely different way and i love how he did a commericial for PeTA talking about animal rights and how the politics in the US have him very concerned This man is more than just a musician hes a humanitarian producer owner of dogs son brother and so much of a role model to me
