I think that this trend is described in the article toward the end of the Orthodox section in the Role of the Talmud portion  If you would like to add a source that would be helpful  In general this entry has had its ups and downs  In its current state it doesnt quite have the reliability organization and simple readability that this important entry should  That being said I think this article suffers from too much content rather than too little  If you are going to add text about daf yomi and talmud education among the laity that seems fine  but I personally hope that it is kept brief
