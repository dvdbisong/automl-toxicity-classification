Kenneth McKellar 

Please dont leave snide and snooty comments for me about poorly referenced edits I attended Kenneth McKellars funeral in 1997 He was a very dear friend of my families and my parents were devastated by his death His funeral was held in the cathedral in Glasgow A memorial followed some weeks later which was attended by Donald Dewer First Minister of Scotland I am sorry that there is no reference to say that he died and I cant recall the exact date but nor is there a reference to say that he was ever born It astonishes me how editors whove earned themselves a little power on wikipedia often behave Such a pity But I can assure you Kenneth McKellar is dead
