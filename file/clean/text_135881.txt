All sources seem to indicate that the first practical solutions to antialiasing were invented Frank Crow computer graphics pioneer who incidentally works for nVIDIA these days in 1977  Earliest reference I could find was The Aliasing Problem in ComputerGenerated Shaded Images Communications of the ACM vol 2011 pp 799805 Nov 1997  Of course Ive also seen mentions of work done at the Architecture Machine Group at MIT in 1972 but I have not seen any references to published papers  2306 Jan 24 2003 UTC
