I told this to him

Mihaiam  and youre the arbitrator By unreliable sources mean  and vegetarian nutritionists and doctors of medicine like Milton Mills William C Roberts John A McDougall Then you go on calling me a propagandist Well give me one scientific report that says humans are anatomically optimized to eat raw meat or at least a source that says humans are anatomically optimized to process cooked meat without aggravating any serious healthissues see this And exactly what scientific data did Mills provide that is scientifically erroneous Like what is the acidity of humanstomach when food is inside stomach and then you tout veganskepticblogspot as a reliable source for highlevel scientific knowledge Isnt it a tad silly to compare a Nutritionist who has been backed by the claims of other MDs and has a doctoral degree to a random blogger Where is the scientific journal that says humans are not herbivores But when it comes to question your meateating ways you cling to a random person as opposed to a slew of MDs who are cogently saying that the practice of eating meat is unhealthy unneeded and unethical or something of that sort Meateating is at best utterly redundant I repeat please show some credible scientific analysis of Human anatomy that firmly proves humans are purely naturally omnivorous ie able to digest raw meat or if not raw meat then any meat with good health thats all itll to convince me I may be fully wrong Im at least open to that possibility but are you I want whats best for me I occasionally like stew myself D
