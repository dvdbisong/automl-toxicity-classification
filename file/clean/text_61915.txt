It appears that the coin might replace the 1 bill almost completely that soon the 1 bill might get out of circulation As a result of this combined with the fact that Alexander Hamilton is no longer as wellremembered as he was back in 1928 the year that follows whatever year this happens I believe it might be sometime around 2020 might be a time to change the portraits on the bills as follows

The 2 bill changes from Thomas Jefferson to George Washington

The 5 bill changes from Abraham Lincoln to Thomas Jefferson

The 10 bill changes from Alexander Hamilton to Abraham Lincoln

The 20 50 and 100 bills however will not change portraits

What are your votes

Washington on the dollar coin and the 5 bill thus keeping the pattern of Washington on the highest generally circulating coin and the smallest generally circulating bill  Lincoln bumped up to the 10 and the quarter dropping the penny Hamilton bumped up to the 20 or Lincoln bumped up to the 20 Hamilton staying on the 10  The 50 and 100 stay the same  Another idea  Washington on the 20 bill Lincoln on the 1 coin again killing the penny  0627 18 Jan 2005 UTC

Oh and while were at it lets add a 500 bill  And make our bills prettier  0629 18 Jan 2005 UTC

I think its quite a demotion for Washington to go from the onedollar bill to the twodollar bill  1831 26 Feb 2004 UTC

Surely being on a higher denomination curculating bill is more desirable otherwise why not put old George on the cent coin  2316 27 Feb 2004 UTC

Why would anyone want to put George Washington on the cent coin He is already on the quarter coin and it is silly for there to be 2 coins with the same portrait

MrWeeble no one in the United States ever uses twodollar bills They are considered rarities  2117 5 Mar 2004 UTC
