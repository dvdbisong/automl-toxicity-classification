I think theres little doubt that there is taking in both directions here More than likely the World Golf Hall of Fame used the Wikipedia article as inspiration for their own text and then an editor came in and copied over a small amount of content from their website Unless the earlier Wikipedia article copied from another source which they later also used She was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2007 and would presumably not have entered their literature prior to that point But the other content from that passage has been evolving in our article since it was created in 2004

This evolved gradually and naturally into the form it was in when in August 2010 it was sources probably circularly to the WGHoF and the snippet of their text pasted in

Meanwhile not all but some of the content from that edit needs to be cleaned up a bit to comply with WPCopypaste For now Ill clumsily address it with quotation marks  talk
