TwoWay Communication in Public Relations
Twoway communication can be contrasted with broadcasting a oneway form of communicationCitation neededdateOctober 2007 Twoway communication uses communication to negotiate with the public resolve conflict and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its publics 

There are different types of twoway communication in public relations symmetric and asymmetric

Twoway asymmetric
Employs social science methods to develop morePersuasive communication
Generally focuses on achieving shortterm attitude change
Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics
Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization its policies or its views

Twoway symmetric public relations
Relies on honest and open twoway communication and mutual giveandtake rather than oneway persuasion
Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding
Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises
Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics
Seems to be used more by nonprofit organizations government agencies and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive profitdriven companiesSource Managing Public Relations by James E Grunig and Todd Hunt 1984
