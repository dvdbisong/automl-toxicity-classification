I declined the speedy delete request because the reason given doesnt match any of the criteria in WikipediaCriteria for speedy deletion  If theres a good chance that this article can be expanded and given enough content to qualify at least as a stub then there shouldnt be a rush to delete it  If there are still objections to the article then the processes WPPROD or WPAFD apply  Asking for speedy deletion has a chilling effect on editors who are trying to create new articles   Elkspeak
