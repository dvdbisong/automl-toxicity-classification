I believe that Cochrane is a high quality source If Cochrane makes conclusions specifically about chiropractic then we should feel free to use it as a source regardless of whether the conclusions are positive or negative for chiropractic However we should not include Cochrane reviews which are only making conclusions about spinal manipulation in general not specifically about chiropractic Such reviews are best suited for the Spinal manipulation article

 I am in the process of creating a detailed but clear RfC to address this matter in general but if the editors here can generally agree to the proposal Eubulides describes here as to remove citations to sources using research which does not make any conclusions about chiropractic specifically then I see no need to open the RfC can of worms   discuss
