Here is a little histoy on novaseminry More can easily be found I include it here to show the type of editor he is
 
Request topic ban of UserNovaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait stuntman
 
UserNovaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait stuntman BLP deleted twice before Here and here But having failed at deletion twice for two years now Novaseminary has also failed at WPLETITGO He persistently challenges the BLPs notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt He also regularly violates WPDE He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis pushes POV attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP creates suspect disambig stubs insists on irrelevant or dated edits violates OR uses citation tags to edit war like here here here and here removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLPs subject over several editors objections
 
But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue  defend his indefensible actions even as he ignores all the WP rules  policies that his tendentious editing violates He cites the rules that give him cover and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive Recommend an immediate topic ban Not just for the Douglas Tait stuntman BLP but for all the articles sourced in the BLP Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them 26023045EA152A9A449F5CE8339FCA2 talk 
 This looks like a content dispute Have you taken this to WPDRN as a first port of call Ritchie333 talk cont 
Unfortunately its more than a content issue Its a persistent longterm pattern of disruptive behavior So per WPDDE ANI may be the best first step 26023045EA152A9A449F5CE8339FCA2 talk 
The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone Drmies talk 
Fact is unless admins enforce it dont count on it Otherwise I wouldnt have had to come here Ive suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article He refused 26023045EA152A93533DED547AAB44 talk 

 
I found this at WPRFPP and have spent more time than Im willing to admit looking through it all 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminarys bizarre obsession with this person Im going to give Novaseminary time to respond but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users  Steel 
 You know what Ill accept that If Novaseminary is topic banned Ill voluntarily selfban My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitoredreviewed by uninvolved 3rd partyparties to insure no Novaseminary POV Thanks 26023045EA152A93533DED547AAB44 talk 
Ive never violated a single guideline or policy at this article The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited This article was one of several resumelike PRPOV articles ive come across over the years I and others tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist Almost everything ive done ive discussed at talk I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB Novaseminary talk 
I would also point out I only nominated this article for deletion once with no consensus I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made not by me but another editor The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of but that I think comply with policy At one point the article cited several nonRS articles written by a single publicist for instance Novaseminary talk 
Our IP user has agreed to a selfban from this article providing you do the same From your comments above that the IPs edits are the only reason youve even been editing the page recently this should be an acceptable resolution for you too Right  Steel  Yes Novaseminary I do agree that you have an alltoo strong interest in that article Drmies talk 1716 13 October
