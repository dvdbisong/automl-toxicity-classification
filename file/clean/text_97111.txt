Your sorting effort 

Wow This will raise the number of assessed articles substantially Do I understand the process correctly that once tagging is done a bot will generate overview and stats pages

One minor caveat Award articles like Wigner medal all seem to get the stub category per auto allegedly because of a stub template But
 To the best of my knowledge those articles never had a stub template
 IMHO there is no big potential for expansion either they
 should be considered listlike and excempt from article assessment
 be rated somewhat like short but no need to grow  a seemingly missing assessment grade

Only a nitpick in the grand scheme but Im just watching a number of those articles so I was wondering
