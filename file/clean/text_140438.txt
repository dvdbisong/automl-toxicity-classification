Can you please just leave me alone Ibaranoff This conversation did not involve you Why do you feel the need to make everything about you I asked you politely to please not but in on this conversation This was just me talking to Jauerback about my block okay Apparently just as you refuse to read the sourcessee his numerous edits on the list of nu metal bands page especially the most recent and various other articles you also refuse to read the title of this section You are being for what its worth a cyber bully I say have a nice night to you I say you have done good work with the Muddy Waters albums and all I get is RG your personality sucks RG you and Baz are fools Youre a child You just want to d me around and all the rest of that harassment I still havent even gotten a simple little apology Talk to your friends or juggalos or whatever they call them alright Rubbing salt in the wound is not productive Comment on the content not the contributer If you aint got nothing nice to say I may not be perfect but I certainly dont need to be attacked on a daily basis here
Getting back to where I was before Jauerback I am really sorry this conversation had to play out on your talk page with Sugar Bear here getting me completely off topic and that last comment of mine above was suppose to be my last on this section In the end my belief on the block was I cant change the past I was blocked even though I believe it was unjust You have your opinion and I have mine I think it was ill warned you dont Lets let bygones be bygones fair enough Good night sir
