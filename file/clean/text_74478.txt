I didnt make a threat I said Im not going to block you And you dont need to apologize to me I was suggesting you apologize to the user whose edit you reverted in the link I gave you above That user asked me to block you Since Im not going to do that because after talking it over I can see that your intentions are good it wouldnt kill you to drop them a line to apologize for your mistake It doesnt cost you anything Youll gain a lot more respect for apologizing than you will for refusing to
Ive taken more time with you than any editor has since youve been on Wikipedia and certainly more time than you took with any of the IP addresses whose contributions you reverted But I do have other things to do like blocking actual vandals and I need you to understand that you cant just remove the contributions of others without a solid reason I direct you once again to CheckUser If you dont want to use it and insist on reverting valid edits your fate is in your hands  Talk
