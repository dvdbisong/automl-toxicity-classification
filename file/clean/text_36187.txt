Hello Ben 

If you are going to insert a NPOV header on the page you are supposed to justify all and every point you have in mind not completely smash up a page and then rewrite it with no discussion or debate as a Watchtower PR exercise Many others here have covered these issues over and over and the page has been approved by two administrators in regard to the eschatology section My edits were reverting not altering the main text sections I only edited the last 1995 bit and youve said nothing about that except made unfounded claims All major changes are supposed to be discussed first and you have not done that you have just ripped out the factual material and done a whitewash edit in apologist speak to look like it was all a minor dream or something

A couple of points I will pick up on were where you claimed in regard to 1799 1914 1920 and 1925 etc that they were suggestive and purely speculative but Ben not one of those dates falls into your apologist descriptions you are clearly not being reasonable rational or honest

You then say Progressive adjustments of understanding in the face of unfolding events resulted in a period of changing explanations centered around the years 1914 1918 1920 and 1925 That is also incorrect because those dates were only changed after their humiliating failure not before It hardly takes a brain surgeon to change a prediction where the world is still looking on long after the end was supposed have arrived You also are trying to use very deceitful terminologies to try and pacify the facts to more and more insignificance when they were anything but that at their times of publishing An example of your gross dishonesty is here where you say Other dates variously considered being time of Gods judgement Since when were they variously considered They forcefully stated we affirm that Scripturally scientifically and historically presenttruth chronology is correct beyond a doubt Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed   and This chronology is not of man but of God Being of divine origin and divinely corroborated presenttruth chronology stands in a class by itself absolutely and unqualifiedly correct What you inserted was gross fabrication and deceit Ben Why What is your agenda If you are embarrassed get over it You should not destroy whole pages due to your religious ties to the JWs

Ben you said They do not profess to be inspired but they use ever synonym in the book that directly implies that exact same thing see quotes here 1 and here 2 why are you hiding this balance

There are a lot more points that you are misleading and censoring for your own agenda and that is not the purpose of Wikepedia I get the impression you are possibly a na√Øve JW who does not know about the real history of your religion please dont take offence at this it is a common thing and so you edit in good faith that your indoctrinated info from the watchtower org is correct Please do some detailed research before you vandalise many editors hard work Wikepedia is here for accurate information be it good or bad but not public relations platform for religious groups and their biases You have also repeatedly changed long accepted text with no discussion Can I suggest you look up the 14 pages of talk and read them all carefully before you abuse the hard work of others with your grossly biased unauthorized edits Best wishes  17th of September 2005 PS For more info read some oh the Watchtower orgs published material here 1914 1975 and the whole lot four pages
