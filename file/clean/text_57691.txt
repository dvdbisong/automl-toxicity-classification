Articles for Deletion 

I realize you are not happy with the current turn of events However in a project like Wikipedia where pretty much everyone can post anything and challenge anything it happens Sometimes edit wars devolve into situations like this

The deletion debate process has to be available to prevent people from cluttering up Wikipedia with all sorts of stuff Some can abuse the process some can resort to it in good faith and turn out to be wrong

Personally I have no knowledge of whether this is a prominent web server or not I dont know whether the other party is just being antagonistic or really believes Zeus is not worthy of inclusion There is a Wikipedia policy to try to assume good faith on the part of everyone whenever possible To respond by going after other products or attacking Boborok would be a mistake

The proper way to handle it is to gather information to bolster your case Look for industry publications that have written articles about Zeus note not forums they dont carry much weight Any statistics you can find again from reliable sources on the prevalence of the software would help Post links in the Articles for Deletion discussion so that others can review them You will find that other Wikipedia editors are reasonable people and if you make your case calmly and reasonably you will find it listened to Forget about Boborok and whatever his motives may be Concentrate on the subject at hand

Huge numbers of articles are nominated for deletion but kept and once that happens it becomes much much harder for anyone to try to nominate them again

Hope this helps
