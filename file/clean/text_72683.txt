The Splitter is being ridiculous 

Regardless of canonicity the events of this game clearly do not take place in the main timeline Metal Gear Solid makes it clear that Snake met Mei Ling in 2005 and MGS4 makes it clear that Big Boss survived the events of Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake while Ghost Babel shows that Big Boss died in Outer Heaven and never created Zanzibar Land
