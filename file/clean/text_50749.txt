Hindi Wiki Insert toolbox
Hi
The Hindi wikipedias Insert toolbox has been edited to include many new characters Please edit and common page at Hindi wiki just to view the new insertbox About the स and श with dot below I shall give a detailed explaination later And I know that the comments within this toolbox are very nervejarring but to encourage foreigners etc I think the phonetic symbols should be there Please bear with me for that Also I have given a completely new look to the main page please see it Thanks
