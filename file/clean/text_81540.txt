Repetitive edits from Boeing registered IPs 

Over the past couple of days there have been repetitive biased edits made on this page from two different IP addresses registered with the Boeing corporation in Washington Ive reversed some of the blatant vandalism and a couple of the edits have been neutral enough to not have to undo but Im afraid if I keep undoing these Ill be blocked from editing Im relatively new to Wikipedias procedures but understand neutral editing so Im unsure exactly what action to take here Seems like Boeing should revisit their internet usage policy
