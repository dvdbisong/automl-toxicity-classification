Capitalisation of waterways features 

Hi Can you please point me to the WPMOS page that says all individual bridges tunnels locks etc must be described in lower case As far as I am concerned Basingstoke Canal and Foxton Locks are proper nouns and should be capitalised as such It is correct to talk about the locks at Foxton and the canal in Basingstoke but using mixed capitalisation is misleading Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as Foxton  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock unless there was more than one of them one would write the Bath Deep Lock There is only one Bath Deep Lock so Bath deep lock is not an appropriate nomenclature however Bath chair and Bath bun describe generic items and should not be capitalised

Could you please doublecheck your reference for this format and apply the necessary corrections Thank you
