Dosupport and the threerevert rule 

Hello Tjo3ya You and Drewward appear to be engaged in an edit war on the article Dosupport I understand your frustration with editing this and other languagerelated articles but there is a brightline rule called the three revert rule or 3RR which says that if you revert an article three or more times within twentyfour hours you will be temporarily blocked from editing In order to deal with an editor who repeatedly reverts an article without discussion you should report the behavior to one of the WikipediaNoticeboards such as WikipediaAdministrators noticeboardIncidents
