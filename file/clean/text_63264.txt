 You are too funny I am Gay are you blind to the pink triangle in my name and active to make sure that Gay conservatives especially homophobic ones are outed   
 You here I mean BmS claim in the same sentence that gay people cant be homophobic but that gay conservatives are homophobic If you cant see the contradiction in that there nothing I can tell you Anyway if you think my providing evidence of your bigotry qualifies as a personal attack please dont say remove NPA and keep my name Thats just rude You are exceedingly eager to call any word against you a personal attack in spite of the guidelines given in WikipediaNo personal attacks yet equally eager to engage in personal attacks yourself Again if you cant see the contradiction Finally   
 Thank you for reminding me about my focus on outing Gay conservatives It is time to get to work on the Merv Griffin article   
 Outing people in not relevant to Wikipedia Original research is not the place for Wikipedia I honestly think you are confused as to the purpose of Wikipedia It is not a place to get in your personal jabs and put in your opinions of the topics of the day There are plenty of sites for that  blogs user discussion boards USENET Wikipedia is not one of them
