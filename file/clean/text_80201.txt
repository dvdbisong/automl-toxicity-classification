I merely meant in my preamble to what I was saying that I believed that assumptions contrary to that indicated in the reference should not be made where there was not clear indication that the person had adopted the nationality of the place of their death For example if they died in New York having lived there for 30 years but were actually born in London England surely the only assumption in the absence of a mention in the source being used is that this person would still be English or British if you prefer There is little point in conducting painstaking research just for a tagline in a list But lets try to be correct in what we put in that tagline is all Im saying We cant mislead surely I didnt exepct this to go so indepth  a mere yes I agree or no youre wrong  or even dont know  would suffice Thanks for the input anyway Im none the wiser to be frank  chewdo
