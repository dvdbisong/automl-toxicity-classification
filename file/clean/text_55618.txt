American Culture 

Jamie you may not know it but theres a rule in America about culture Once you give ABSOLUTE Legalism definition to it it is dead Lets think about it for a second Did MLK have a day BEFORE he was dead NoBlack history month AFTER the panthers  The reason I put the disclaimer that the story on American culture on Wikipedia is an INFERENCE is because America is consistently redefining itself because our culture is not yet dead Once you put it in an encyclopedia it is defined ABSOLUTELY and therefore the culture is then predictable and Dull It is an ongoing cycle that enacts simultaneously each moment You update it every month maybe but in the country it is updated every moment and thats faster then you can type It IS an inference
