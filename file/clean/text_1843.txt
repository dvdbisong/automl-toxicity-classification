This requires a discussion Silly indeed The edit you prefer mentioned a righthanded model which the lefthanded Iommi played upside down Fine Then it jumped immediately to the original lefthanded SG guitar Dont you suppose the average reader might stop and think What original lefthanded SG guitar is being referred to So I restored the original text which explains it Its one sentence for Gods sake and it serves to provide some needed context
