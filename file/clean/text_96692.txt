Awickert this article Deformation mechanics has the objective which you propose of discussing in one article the concept of deformation strain And from here to link to other more detailed articles about Finite and Infinitesimal deformation theories
If some of the material that was in the article strain tensor is not included please bring it back into this article or the Infinitesimal strain theory article
Renaming the Infinitesimal strain theory and Finite strain theory into infinitesimal strain and finite strain it is something I have to think about My first impression is that the word theory is broader than just saying strain
