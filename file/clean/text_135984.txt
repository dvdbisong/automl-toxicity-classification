UserAlien3 thinks Im edit warring 

which is confusing since Im not even close to 3RR But anyway I thought Id drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article Per WPLEDECITE 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body and information in the lead section of noncontroversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside I dont think theres anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as progressive Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later I think the citation should be cut from the lede 

All that said Im not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself Suppose for the sake of argument that MM described itself as impartial it doesnt btw Would it be alright then for Wikipedia to describe MM as an impartial media watchdog replete with cite to their web site IMO MM cant be a WPRS for information about MM theyre biased and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV Whats more if were not taking MM at their word but instead only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible thats differently problematic for being WPOR Its not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources we shouldnt even be using them

To the end of sidestepping the whole issue Id like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization  But I dont think it should appear in the lede either 

Ill leave it to some other editor to use the ref or not Im easy lest I be accused of further edit warring 24177120138
