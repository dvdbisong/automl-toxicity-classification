2162341288 Sforzas study was indeed limited in this way However Passarino was far more thorough in his research all major Ethiopian ethnicities plus Somalians and it is to his studies that Im referring Therefore the valid criticism of the limitations of Sforzas study is first completely irrelevant in light of Passarinos findings and second it just clutters up the already alltoolarge article Also do NOT delete the counterview point to the criticism of Braces study The article deals with a CONTROVERSY it is not a tool to advance Afrocentric or Eurocentric views Keep that in mind
