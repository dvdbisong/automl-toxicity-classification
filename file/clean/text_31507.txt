All of the arguments for blocking this user essentially boil down to I dont like him and decided to make an enemy of him You chose to view his userpage You are chosing to put on the pseudoPC act of claiming the userboxes are offensive as if that has any meaning If you are so sensitive as to piss and moan for a block over the above examples you do not belong on the internet or in human society for that matter Grow up You point to his agenda thinking there is some dark overtone or negative value judgment in the word Do you even know what it means You have an agenda I have an agenda No man exists without an agenda for otherwise he would allow himself to starve Agendas goals opinions are an essential part of man and are the psychological foundation for informationaggregating projects like wikipedia But you not in control of your own emotions and psyche and lacking any sort of moralintellectual development can only fixate upon your selfcreated enemyI doubt timecop cares enough to make an enemy of any of you and look for the slightest bit of mud to sling the pitiful examples above Slightly offensive userboxes behaviour that is in your poorlydeveloped opinion disruptive Pretending that your actions are in any way for the benefit of wikipedia or that they are anything other than a childish internet bitchfight is blatantly dishonest cynical and immature I say again to all of you especially HighinBC grow up 2425511232 
is the full text that I was blocked for
It is obvious that the block or referring to my statement as a personal attack is dishonest and not in good faith I stand by my full assertion that the rogue admin HighinBC has demonstrated he is too sensitive to function in human society especially around the sorts of bizarro humor and relations one finds on the internet  
I request an unblock for my IP and I further request that HighinBC be removed from adminship for the following reasons
1 Abuse of Admin block powers here and elsewhere This is but one of many examples of this rogue admin using weasel interpretation to read an attack into something
2 Edit stalking See the pump
3 Using weasel interpretation to read all manner of nonexistent WP violations in the userTimecop dorama
A review of this rogue admins behaviour shows that he consistently uses weasel interpretation to employ WP against any user that crosses him
