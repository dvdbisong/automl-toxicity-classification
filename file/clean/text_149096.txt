Who is this guy Writes symbolic stories about superheroes Not exactly Harold Pinter then The length and overexcessive detail of this fanpiece confirms the worst prejudices of anyone who thinks that the internet and wikipedia are too weighted in favour of transient trivia This should be hacked back to one paragraph and do we really need photographs
