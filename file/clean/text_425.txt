Quoting Hoppe first Detailing Kinsellas important points
At this diff I put in the Democracy section Hoppes earlier comment first and followed with more about what Kinsella said ie
Stephan Kinsella writes that Hoppes critics have accused Hoppe of homophobia bigotry and the like based on these passages Kinsella wrote that that Hoppes discussion of physically removing homosexuals and other groups only applied to private covenantbased communities centered around traditional values He shared a letter Hope wrote to him saying the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society
As I said in my edit summary just because some choose to totally take his comments about of context and attack him does NOT mean that Wikipedia should be used for the same purpose   talkie talkie
