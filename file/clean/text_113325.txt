Hey GiveItSomeThought 

Dude was it really necessary to spam the living bejesus out of the history of this page with one ridiculously small change after another  Did you really have to save the page after removing each coma and changed pronoun  Next time please  for the love of god just comb through the article and make all the changes you want in a couple edits rather than the like 30 edits you had yesterday  Man alive
