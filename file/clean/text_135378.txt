Animal Farm in popular culture 

Hi just so you know if you dont watch the page Doniago has decided he owns that page again and has deleted or removed all of your very wellresearched and documented references I know I am in no mood to deal with him again and as you pointed out published works of fiction songs recorded and played on the radio and television episodes broadcast to the world etc are their own references I have no idea what kind of value Doniago sees in only having four occurrences of Animal Farm in popular culture listed on the page Makes it sound insignificant and therefore unworthy of a wiki article Your edit made it sound prodigious and influential Hope you feel like retackling the challenge
