You are wrong 

You are wrong in my opposition to Joturners RfA I do NOT oppose him because he believes something I do not as you incorrectly stated I oppose him because of the fear I have that based on his zealous userpage regarding his religion that he will NOT be able to maintain a NPOV I am Catholic pretty devout and I would oppose a fellow Catholic if heshe too was overzealous in their POV That said I have the RIGHT as a sentinent life form to have my own opinion and that is something that the liberal left and the conservative right can NEVER take away from me so dont even try
