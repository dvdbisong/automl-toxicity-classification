Gibraltar
Hello Woohookitty

User Ecemaml has told us to ask you for help with a problem me and a number of users including Ecemaml have had with the article on Gibraltar Perhaps you could provide some form of arbitration There is no particular dispute at this moment although over the past few months user Gibnews has imposed his POV version of the article on the vast majority of users Other opinions backed with acceptable sources are dismissed by him as proSpanish He also seems to convey a sense of irrational hostility towards Spain and Spaniards which are reflected in his edits If you check the history of the talk page he has driven away a number of users over the past few months He is now engaged in disputes regarding articles on San Roque and Algeciras cities close to the British territory of Gibraltar Permanently banned user Gibraltarian has recently returned to support him as an unregistered user signing as yanito On the other side of the debate the only user showing a Pro Spanish POV tendentious and aggressive behaviour is User Ismael76 although he seems to have got bored of the issue and left the debate

I was wondering if you could give us some advice on what we should do with Gibnews and the article in general It is sad when users appropriate articles as their own to express their POVs
