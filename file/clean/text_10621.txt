my edits on this section is also being edited out and labeled as vandalism regrettably by the same person over and over again To repeat again im editing in good faith im just mentioning the authors on the treaty section im NOT altering the context i find the lack of transparency about where the sources come from very disturbing and for me being personally chastised very obnoxious
