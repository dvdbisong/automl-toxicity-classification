Actually it is an accepted and common practice to post information about ongoing discussions on project pages in boldface type  for example see  as well as the many other postings about ongoing AFD discussions accessible from the page history of WikipediaWikiProject Inclusion  It does not appear that administrators have removed these postings or that members of WikiProject Inclusion have been warned to refrain from such postings  despite the fact that WikiProject Inclusion is explicitly partisan as to the preferred outcome of AFD discussions  Why then is information about ongoing discussions posted on WikipediaCounterVandalism Unit removed and why am I warned that I must not continue to post it
