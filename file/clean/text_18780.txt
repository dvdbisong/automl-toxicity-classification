Im having this problem with  at the moment he had twice reverted my Kaleutn to Kaleu What the crew actually call der Alte in the film is phonetically Herr Kaleutn The t and the n are both clearly heard I have had my hearing of this word confirmed from a German friend in Hamburg When I read Kaleu I wondered what this meant as it does not occur at all in the film So I agree with Hakkasberra that the article should use Kaleutn But how do we convince  to leave it there Anyone know
