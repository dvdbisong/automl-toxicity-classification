Thanks for your very helpful comments Yiddish authors belonging to the postwar generation who have published one or more books include Alexander Belousov Sholem Berger Leybl Botwinik Velvl Chernin Gennadi Estaikh Mikhoel Felzenbaum Daniel Galay Moyshe Lemster Yitskhok Niborski Boris Karloff pen name of DovBer Kerler Heershadovid Menkes pen name of Dovid Katz Boris Sandler Dmitry Yakirevich Please note however that not all of them were included in the recently suggested revision 

As for the even younger authors Yisroel Nekrasov is widely published in literary periodicals in Israel USA and Russia and his first book collection is scheduled to appear within next few weeks in Moscow selections of his original poetry can be read in the online magazine Der Bavebter Yid and on  Boris Kotlermans original prose was published in two major Yiddish literary periodicals in Israel at least twice in each one of them Haike Beruriah Wiegands poetry appeared in Bavebter Yid and soon in Yerusholaimer Almanakh in Jerusalem see a small selection of her highly sophisticated verse at  Perhaps a special case could be made for retaining their names in this entry for it is not all that easy for a contemporary Yiddish author to publish her or his work in a separate book no matter how well known and well received that work might be among contemporary Yiddish readers A case in point is Alexander Belousov whose work was extremely well known and widely acclaimed but whose first and so far the only collection of works appeared posthumously in 2006 

Finally and for the record there are also two Yiddish poets and Yiddish scholars Gilles Rosier in Paris and Thomas Soxberger in Vienna who are also accomplished and well published novelistsin in French and German respectively

Once again many many thanks for your very helpful and constructive comments
