Youre mistaken I was never blocked since I have always been able to edit articles with no problem I think you mean CJ DUB And Seb why does CJ DUB keep bothering me and others I seriously dont understand why hes angry at people just because they dont agree with him his american culture or his politics I would never waste my time harassing others like hes doing unless I had alot of time on my hands Im going on vacation soon so hopefully when I return he will have cooled off Nobody here needs to be disrespected 
And no disrespect to you or your american way of life but I notice that americans on wiki think they should be right about everything Thats not right There are other voices who contribute to wiki too and should be able to correct an article without reprimand disrespect or having their material even with reliable sources suddenly deleted just because their info deviates from the american point of view on wiki And then when people provide the info and sources they get laughed at and harassed about it Thats not right This behavior motivates others to not look at americans in a good light I wish people in general were in control of wiki Sadly it seems as though the american voice is the only voice that controls and matters on wiki Anyway thats my two cents for what its worth
