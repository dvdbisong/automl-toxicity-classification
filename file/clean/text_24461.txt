The issue in this case is the same as in most cases of complaints about BetacommandBot  the user sees this large notification message and rather than take the time to read the message through and do a little research ie read the provided links its easier to complain that the bot is running improperly the policy isnt fair etc I personally have had many images tagged by the bot this week as when they were uploaded I was unaware of the FURG I took the time to familiarize myself with them and now all those images are properly tagged Its not Betacommands fault for not taking the time to explain this every time to every user  its the users fault for not taking the time to read the explanations provided in the first place
