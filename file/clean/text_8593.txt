Oh yeah Read the proof again Its okay for the product to be negative zero I am not saying this is incorrect I am making no assumptions I showed that 1  0  0 and then I showed that 1  0  0 and by transitivity of equality what this means is that the left hand side which is the same equals the rhs of 0 and 0 respectively therefore 0 and 0 must be the same these are equal No rocket science required here Melchoir
