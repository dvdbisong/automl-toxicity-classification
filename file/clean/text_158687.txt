Youre glossing over the point that the assertion of hanging as cause of death is hearsay not a proven verified fact Hearsay repeated and reprinted infinite times doesnt outweigh the verifiable published fact that no exact cause of death has been released by officials No autopsy has been done  No coroners report has been made public All these reliable news sources you give are presenting an unproven speculation as fact but that doesnt make it a fact News outlets are more or less reliable on a spectrumnone of them should be accepted as absolute universal arbiters of Truth The article in its current form specifically the contentious sentence that precedes the Investigation section presents hearsay as fact duplicating the fallacy presented by the news outlets Presuming hearsay is fact does not make it fact
