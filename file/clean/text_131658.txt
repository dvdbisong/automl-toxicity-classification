It is difficult to know how to divide this material  There is the pederastypaedophilia distinction which is partly one of age under age of consent but pubescent under age of consent but prepubescent partly one of gender pederasty is specifically boys  interesting as far as I can see that there are no articles concerning the ancient institutionalised practice of older men marrying young girls  Partly one of the supposed acceptance of pederasty in old but nonGreek cultures very little actual evidence for that I think and finally the institutionalisation of pederasty in classical Greek culture  All these should be handled differently
