Having Been raised in this hole I tend too look at it like the kind of place that you wished had never existed and that no one should have to be raised in Given that I have subsequently moved and often visit to see friends here It is still there and looking better than it ever did Thriving community Well not any more But it still gave me the drive and desire to go away and escape from the notoriety assosciated with it and the people The notoriety isnt aimed at everyone but brushes and tar spring to mind Take out the junkies and the idiots it would be great Even now I still see the idiots that were older than i was then but idiots all the same when I was growing up Most people forget that its through memories that we form opinions but it was the safest place for kids growing up and you could always find someone who knew you and your parents It possibly still is but I dont stay there any more so I cant really comment
