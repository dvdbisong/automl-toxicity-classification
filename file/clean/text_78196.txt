Poison chalice 

Last years Poison chalice team Garden Suburb FC lost their 2015 first round fixture to Toronto Awaba who in turn lost to Jesmond FC Wouldnt it be interesting if it happened again HahahaThough to be fair a Poison chalice truly starts with it going all the way back to the first qualifying rounds or in this case the Preliminary Rounds Still though could be interesting to see if something similar happens again this season or what Its not that common its only happened like 4 times from memory in the FA Cup
