Thank you so much for your kind words  I do appreciate your first hand account of the coup and of the way it has affected your family  Theres nothing personal about the inclusion of family names  biographical articles on Wikipedia generally name close relatives if known and if not readers who know can add them  But I do feel for your family and can sympathize with what I guess could be a desire to protect their privacy  Thats completely understandable  Given that you have lived all your life in Fiji I think you could make a very valuable contribution to WikipediaWikiproject Fiji which attempts to correct update and expand all existing Fijirelated articles and create new ones  So if youre interested wed love to have you on board  And yes Id love to visit Fiji sometime  I look forward to seeing you there
