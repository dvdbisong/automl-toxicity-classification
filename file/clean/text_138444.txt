Officious Busybody  Editing Nazi aka Ddstretch 

On January 7th 2009 Ddstretch disabled editing from an IP address that they considered had insulted them by calling them an editing facist This IP address was not a users static address nor indeed a dynamic address attributable therefore to noone but was infact the IP address that shows for all TalkTalk customers in the UK By disabling this address they disabled every single TalkTalk customer in the UK a number which runs into millions They claim not to be an editing facist but then behaved by disabling millions simply because they were insulted despite the large notice above Their actions speak for themselves Any further comment would be superflous
