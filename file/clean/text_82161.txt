WPSYNTH
An RfC was just closed at TalkClimate change denialRfC Must the word denial occur in every citation for climate change denial and it is interesting to read the closing statement there in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WPSYNTH   
The concluding statement says the term climate change denial may be used if the source implicitly states they fall into the general group  It has no relevance to anything discussed here  It certainly is not a loophole for synthesis    
I dont think anyone is looking for loopholes Im not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here just for editors to take a look and to think about it with an open mind I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense   
There is nothing slavish about the devotion  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism    
 I was saying that we dont have to follow that other page slavishly And that other page isnt talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated If you are interested in what it does say then you can read it If you dont want to read it then dont Everything here does not have to be a WPBattleground   
As I have noted before unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim then it does not belong here  Note the discussion just closed at Climate  where the result was basically no consensus at all  Cheers   
Not sure what you mean but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus Im not going beyond what the closing statement said there   
The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things  Generally in peerreviewed literature the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines Christian terrorism as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term Christian religious terrorism with the same definition are referring to the same thing  However another author who uses the expression Christian terrorism and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about religious communal terrorism carried out by Christians or nationalist terrorism between different religious groups
Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC
  
Im so tempted to just reply yes And I really would rather not get into a walloftext over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion This isnt about definitions of Christian terrorism in my view Its about what the closing statement there said that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source does not mean that the source does not apply to a page  editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source that examines in detail the Maronite Monks there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source because it used the word genocide instead of the word terrorism Im pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources in context If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism thats still a discussion we can have So thats why I provided that link Im not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t
