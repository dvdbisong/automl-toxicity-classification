As I suspected complete nonsense Your statement is so silly that I cant begin to tell you how wrong it is You said You there presume that your notyetfiled Arbcom case has been decided I assure you that this was not the case  I would consider that to be a stupid assumption I am not a stupid person I would therefore ask that you assume good faith on my part and withdraw everything on this page based on your mindreading trick
You quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability comment
By the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack If it wasnt so silly I would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack
Heres a few points for you to think on

WPCivil WPAGF  WPNPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles
Then lets consider the ArbCom an article What then is this articles content
Hmm lets see  the ArbCom is an article so what is the ArbCom made of Why members So that means the content of the committee is its members So an election is a decision on the content of this article
So
Members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content
We must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content
You dont like that
WPCivil WPAGF  WPNPA  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles
But ArbCom is not an article It is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee
We must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee
We cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the ArbCom questions
Is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to ArbCom membership If you do not think so how many of the present ArbCom do you consider stupid Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder If there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing The questions were politely put They were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance There was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on ArbCom They were not deferential Which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed
Your threats of blocks I regard as an attempt to bully Do not try to bully me
Finally I would contrast the participation of admins in this ANI with the marshalling of forces which you participated in and then came here
