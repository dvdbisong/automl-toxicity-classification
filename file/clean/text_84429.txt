Yes but the backlog gets horrible in part because half of the pages there are mistagged Its a vicious circle we have there And I understand your view of the criteria but I dont think its correct because and that is what I said to Keegan on your RFA as well admins do not decide whether something is worthy of inclusion A7 for example is just about whether it may possibly be worthy of inclusion not if they are worthy When you gain adminship you have to remember that your personal views of what is worthy of inclusion and what not are completely irrelevant to your work handling pages where there is doubt there is an ArbCom case at the moment because one admin decided to delete pages he deemed unencyclopedic outside policy So carefulness is to be advised in such situations and I am glad you are willing to be more careful After all just cutting away spammy text and making a stub out of a potential G11 for example does not take up more time than tagging it Have a nice day  Why
