A few major concerns with this article
the opening paragraph says unequivocally that Newton discovered calculus in this early notes years before Leibniz however this is not a solid historical fact in my opinion This is based on the reports of newtons own inner circle who claimed that Newton showed the calculus to them These very men had obviously taken Newtons side in a bitter debate that had seen Newton actively try to obfuscate the issue Newton even anonymously wrote the concluding remarks in the report by his own Royal Society whihc claimed Leibniz a fraud and Newton the true discoverer It should be added to the opening paragraph that the dates of Newtons first use of the calculus are based on the witness accounts of Newtons close confidants
