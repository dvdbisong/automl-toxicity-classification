You have all my sympathies Mr Milburn  The Banner does  read the references and Links  he goes immediately go into attack He does not help with the articles he has got in in for deletion In general his only aime is to destroy articles by nominating them for deletion  that is the culture in the Dutch Wikipedia web site where he originates from he is not English at all although his pseudonym does not indicate that and now they they work in groups too are infiltrating this web site too  What they do not realize is that Cyber Bullying is an offence in the UK but when I point that out to him  he says that I am threatening him  He has just nominated my new page Adrianus Johannes Lemmens also for deletion because it is too speculative but he does not point out which part or parts are speculative in his opinion
