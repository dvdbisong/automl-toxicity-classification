My point was that based on number of donations the republican big wigs could max out on support and the two or three 25 dollar donations count more by that pathetic metric The data is worthless and misrepresents everything Unless there is a good source for it it should be left out And as your original claim wasnt even supported by the claim it should be left out anyway And since all employees arent the ones making the decisions the metric cant be useful anyway The stat is wrong worthless worthless worthless worthless and badly cited  0106 2 August
