Source removal on Modern animation in the United States 

You recently removed  a source I added to the article Modern animation in the United States  As best I can tell from your edit summary you removed it because the URL in question was reported in conjunction with external link spam at   However this wasnt an external link it was a legitimate use of the site as a source  It wasnt added by a spammer  I added it  after researching the contents of the article  Its an audio interview from a source thatas we ourselves note in our article about the show in questionhas been quite favorably reviewed by The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times so it seems a reliable source  I have no relation whatsoever to edrantscom or Edward Champion I dont see anything in WPSPAM that would prevent the use of this source despite it having been inappropriately linked by a few editors  The site isnt blacklisted  Can you explain your objection to the citation more fully
