Ok Thank you for your help _ now about the lowercase its an Italian grammar rules all titles obviously written in Italian language like the Nobilities ones political charges onorific ecclesial military ranks etc must be written with the lowercase even if they are the starting words or they appear after a full stop This is a very common mistake in example dott Nicola Romani is correct Dott Nicola Romani is wrong If you want I can cite you 2 references

Sorry again Im being vague You misunderstood my intent Im not saying you are wrong or that the others are right Im just pointing out that they were all consistent and now the Italian template is different to all of the others As I said Im not sure if it matters  I was just pointing out that its now inconsistent
Cheers
