Ive never seen creative director used in the infobox for TV shows because creative director is not a title actually held by someone at least in fictional series to the best of my knowledge It is production designer and thats what theyre credited as It also looks quite odd in the infobox where you have someone who is the production designer listed so high in the infobox just below the creator and above more notable roles such as the cast and executive producers This is a good topic of discussion for TemplateInfobox television that creative_director should be changed to production_designer in the infobox and then moved into the Production portion of the infobox along with other similar crew roles
