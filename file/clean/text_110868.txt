My Userboxes 

Eh hello David I just noticed that you seem to have copied all my user boxes onto your page now theres nothing wrong with that youre entitled to But are you sure you meant to take all of them Some seem to be contradictory first stating that you are from American and later from Ireland so where are you from cause I cant work it out from your page Perhaps you mistakenly pasted in my entire page here and you didnt intend to but it is pretty bizarre dont you think Id appreciate a response thanks
