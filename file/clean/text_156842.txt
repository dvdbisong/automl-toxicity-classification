PS  please take a look at the talk page  I refer to J Bowyer Bell as IRA historian   ONIH gives me grief for this asking sarcastically Ill make it simple  what makes Bell an IRA historian and Taylor a journalist One Night In Hackney303   

But take a look at the Wikipedia entry for J Bowyer Bell  It appears that ONIH created the page and there are many edits attributed to ONIH in the history  The entry includes The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969 and Bells The Secret Army the IRA 19161970 was published the following year and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 19703  So ONIH refers to Bell as the author of a detailed history of the IRA His question was baiting me and then he runs to get me blocked
