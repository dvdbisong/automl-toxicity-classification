Starfleet insignia
Please do not reinsert large amounts of nonfree images that fail our nonfree image policies  WPNFCC3a clearly states that minimal amounts of nonfree material must be used  51 images is plainly not minimal  Also every individual nonfree image must pass each of the ten criteria of WPNFCC  One example of each type of insignia  as currently  may just about pass all ten criteria of the policy but any more is clearly a violation  Thank you Black Kite t c
