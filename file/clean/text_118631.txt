Fine but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV this is also a matter of accuracy  The Eastern Catholic Churches that are in communion with the Vatican are not properly referred to by the term Roman Catholic Chruch only those who practice the Latin or Western Rite are  Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used   The only truely accurate way to refer to the church headed by the Vatican is the Catholic Church and if referring to this church with this title is NPOV then there is no way that this article can be NPOV and use these terms as accurate as possible
I was aware that Catholic also means universal and is a Mark of the Church I have to admit that I was not aware that other sects of Christianity use the word Catholic in their names  It is for this reason alone that perhaps there is no really satisfactory way to resolve this issue and perhaps it is truly best to incorrectly use the term Roman Catholic Church to refer to the entire church that is in communion with the Vatican  I guess in the end it just doesnt matter so I probably wont press the point any further
I still have to ask Apostolic is another Mark of the Church  Is the title of this church NPOV Apostolic Christian Church   One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church  0245 18 Oct 2004 UTC
