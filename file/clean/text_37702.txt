Thank you for your kind words and your warning Ive been aware of Carbonite and the Cabals attempts to hang me out to dry for some time Its hard to miss it when he accuses me of Wikistalking him at pages that I either created or edited before him Does he really think that people wont try to verify his claims Based on this scary little exchange it appears that some people act blindly on what Carbonite says even when he is proven to have violated policy Nevertheless I have faith that a preponderance of the editors at Wikipedia are like you more interested in good articles and harmonious editing than in pushing POV through their influence and administrative powers
