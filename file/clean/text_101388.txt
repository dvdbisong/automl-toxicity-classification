On Charles Gauthier and Armand Point you removed places of birth and death from the lead per MOS You were right to do that You were wrong not to put them back somewhere else Both have now been fixed I will try to remember not to put them in the lead if you try to remember to put them elsewhere when you remove them Thanks
