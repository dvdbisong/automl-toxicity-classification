Hello and request for advice 
Hi Shalom thanks for the post on my talk page when I joined  much appreciated I was just wondering about procedures around dealing with persistent spammers Ive been watching penetration test computer forensics and PCI DSS for a while now and theyve been plagued by linkspamming particularly penetration test which has repeatedly had its content shaved down and links inserted into it Anyway this all comes from one IP address and it ties back to the company which the links are pointing to Can anything be done about this It seems harsh to ban them entirely  I cant even guarantee the user knows how to look at the talk page associated with hisher IP address Any thoughts 
Also I note that my attempt to copy the warning stuff into his talk page a few weeks ago was a bit clumsy
