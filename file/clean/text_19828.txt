Removing the contributions of other wikipedia editors that are not in violationcontradiction to Wikipedia policy is a form of vandalism ZeroSec is not my website and I do not contribute to it nor do I upload content of questionable legal status I was not providing any tips on how to obtain the episodes there are plenty of forums for that The legality of downloaders actions is something that you cannot label as illegal across the board as legal status varies in different countries I was not promoting any website However you clearly do have a conflict of interest with regards to your contributing to Wikipedia I suggest that you keep that in check You have accused me of multiple actions that are against wiki policy and I am insulted by it Your perception of the events pertaining to this editing problem hardly resembles the physical reality This is quite plain to see and if you have difficulty in understanding this or believing it please find another editor to explain this to you or as previously suggested read wikipedia policy and editing help articles
