It might sound plausible yet it doesnt explain the step of being expelled from Wikipedia This unrelated revert triggered the expulsion yet it doesnt have anything to do with ANI and I will prove it on your talk page It was a hasty action to block someone just because he rightfully reverted the disruptive edits of one user who previously has partaken in multiple disputes over the same thing  genres in the infobox  I find it quite ironic that no one seemed to notice that these exaggerated responses are clearlyobviouslynottobetakenseriously which some unrelated users reduced to vicious personal attacksborderline threatening This was used as an excuse to make the final step Also its quite shocking that ANI is treated like pub where everyone can influence others opinions
