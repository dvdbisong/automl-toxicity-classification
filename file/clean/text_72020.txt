I addded the link to positivism because the name of Auguste Comte is often associated to it He is even said to be the founder of this philosophical movement A Google search Auguste Comte positivism returns more than 3000 hits For instance httpwwwerraticimpactcom19thcenturyhtmlcomtehtm

This being said I am not an expert and would not be able to write anything interesting about this theory I am not even sure if the Logical positivism to which positivism redirects at the moment is the same concept or if it has any connection with Comtes theory Maybe there is a misuse in English of positivism instead of positive philosophy but his concept is definitely called positivisme in French

So to answer your question I would believe that the word positivism has its place in an article about Comte but I would leave the final answer to an expert  1346 Oct 25 2002 UTC
