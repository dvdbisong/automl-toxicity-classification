As much as possible all references should be in the text body as inline citations As I went and did many of these before I removed them as I progressed from the external links section since they were in the text Looks like we only have a couple more lefta good article is one goal but if we can add a little bit more and ensure we have covered the topic in its entirety I would suggest sending it to peer review and then to the featured article review as well There is no requirement that a featured article be longish such as Retreat of glaciers since 1850 isin fact there are many articles that are quite short that are also featured So long as we follow WikipediaFeatured article criteria then that si all that matters So I guess Ill shoot Peltoms and emaila nd see if he has anything more he thinks the article needs to be completed
