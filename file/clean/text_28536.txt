Ok so your saying you dont know ray comfort is a fundamentalist then maybe you should not stick you ideas on a topic you do not know about and are unwilling to educate yourself on You could email him and ask him yourself if thats what it takes The fact he is a fundamentalist and people do not like it is not in the rules to remove to remove a fact that was referenced

I have read the policies you cite and I suggest you read the ones I have mentioned as they clearly encompass this situation

Thats lawyering and your opinion on the rules which is offcoruse wrong

Show me in the rules where it says to exclude a verified fact203192914
