You say that 12 of us feel this has a chance of helping I didnt want to check who is who but for clarity how many of those 12 are pro Burma and how many are pro Myanmar And one other note I am not optimistic at all but I do agree that we can find objective mediation We found it last time with the Cabal My point is that objective or not fair or not truthful or not this mediation imho will not solve the issue It is divided for a reason and thats because both sides have facts that support their views Like a split decision prize fight if you get 50 fair judges you will still have a judgment that is all over the place maybe even 2525 I dont recall where but I believe it was said that by agreeing we agree to accept this new resolution I cannot in good conscience sign my name to the agree side based on that condition and the fact I cant see how this will really bring things to an end All the facts are already there for mediators to see no more are needed and it does start to waste ones time to do it again However I also will not sign onto the disagree side because the last decision while in the books as 21 for Burma has that one dubious vote that is bothersome to me
