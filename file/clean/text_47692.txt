Your  Application 

Dear HammerHeadHuman

Thank you for applying for  VP As you may know VP is a very powerful program and in fact the just released  has even more power Because of this we must uphold strict protocols before approving a new applicant Regretfully I have chosen to decline your application at this time The reason for this is that I dont think you have enough experiance with vandalsim Please note it is nothing personal by any means and we certainly welcome you to apply again soon Thank you for your interest in VandalProof  talk  contribs
