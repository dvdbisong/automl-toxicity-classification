Well in my opinion high schools are of borderline notability  Usually high schools have tens of thousands of graduates each one spending hours and hours there for a four year period with countless memories during a time of transition in their lives  Some have more students than say Bryn Mawr College  Also to try to delete every article on a high school is an unspeakably futile act  It just cant happen and even if they were deleted theyd just pop right back up like weeds
