Unlike you I know the point of view of each community and therefore can attempt to be neutral This is why I have removed a provocative image of an antiGreek Cypriot Turkish nationalist rally from the page which displayed the Turkish and Turkish occupation regimes flags and not on flag of the Republic of Cyprus which in any case breaks the rules on not including national flags on articles about ethnic minorities The image would have only provoked someone to include an image of the last antiTurkish occupation really in Trafalgar Square and politicised the entire page Stop interfering in issues you do not understand You also failed to understand that the 300000 figure give by Federation of Cypriots refers to people it represents The Federation of Cypriots does not represent Turkish Cypriots The majority of Turkish Cypriot organisations refuse to have any dealings with it
