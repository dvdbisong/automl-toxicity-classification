This is not an accident 

Some of the sectionsarticles on Kambojas as being edited and altered by Debachmann are getting utterly confusing and more messier and Im afraid may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers As he has started editingaltering them en mass either he should improve the articles by editing them suitably so as to keep them clear logical and readable and at the same time also maintainkeep intact their integrity and factuality lets us if he can do it or else I will have no alternative except to revert them back to their original versions For example the article Language and ethnicity of Kambojas in its current form which he has edited is utterly terrible I dont think he and other editors on kamboj articles of his kind are quite familiar with the Kamboj history so as to render them a justice Further please make a note that none of the information in any of articles on the Kambojas is a originalresearch as Mr Debachmann continues to allege All the Kamboj information is in the books and only he and other people of his ilk may not be aware of it I have sent this note to him not with any intention to enter into a futile argument with him but simply to let him know that all the information on the Kambojasancientmediaval or modern as inserted in any Kamboj related article here is welldocumented and has been taken from reliable referencessources from notable scholars

Cheers and have a nice day
