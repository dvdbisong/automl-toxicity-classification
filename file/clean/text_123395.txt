Revert from 12 Feb 2008
Ive just reverted an edit for the same reason as given on An_Exceptionally_Simple_Theory_of_EverythingRecent_reverts_2F_22no_new_Einstein In addition this edit here appears to be a mere duplication which should be avoided If there would be more about Lisi the person then it should be added here but the new article appears more to be about the general realm of the theory and therefore would not belong here Thanks Jens
