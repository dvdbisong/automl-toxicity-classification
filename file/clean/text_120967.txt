Now that I have your attention 
The warning was to get your attention You seem to be new and you may share the bewilderment of all newcomers with Wikipedia policy Bewilderment is understandable 

Just take it a bit easier okay 
Please  discuss your edits on the talk page rather than edit war 
Please include a summary of your edit with every edit 
Doing those two steps will calm the other editors who will be happy to discuss the articles with you 

Sincerely Wolfowitz
