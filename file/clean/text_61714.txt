NEWBERRY YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF USER 24  HERE IS THE TEXT THAT USER 24 DELETED

Ahhhh I see that Wigdor er I mean User241686627 is trying to worm his way back into this surrealism article again  Stirling you might want to check the logs to see how Wigdor was previously removed from the article  Wigdor is nothing but an emerging artist who thinks hes the next Salvador Dali  

Keith er I mean User241686627 I have my messages saved as text in a separate file so if you delete my posts then I will simply reinsert them  You cant bury the truth   1651 13 Jan 2005 UTC

User241686627 Please dont delete my posts  That is very rude

The following was deleted by user241686627 this morning  Why would he delete this post I wonder

If anyone is curious in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism it should be noticed that both user631691042 and user241686627 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward If you have any doubts then check the discussion page for that article
    
It wasnt long ago that all references to Keith Wigdor were removed from this surrealism article This removal occured because of Wigdors total unimportance to the surrealist movement for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is at best an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist Needless to say many of the englishspeaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist  
 
It is also interesting to note if you check the discussion archives of this surrealism article that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist in this very article Also if you look at some of the recent belligerent trollish thikeish posts of these 2 users it shouldnt be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor

For the 2 noname users mentioned here who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution for they are one and the same and also happen to be Keith Wigdor who is playing a sockpuppet game  2210 11 Jan 2005 UTC
