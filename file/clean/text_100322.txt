Templates need undeleting 

Please undelete TemplateNNDB and TemplateUser temporarily inactive The admin who closed those TfDs and deleted the templates did not orphan the templates first which has left redlinked templates on 1000 and 400 pages respectively As per the usual process with TfD these should be listed at WPTFDH for orphaning prior to deletion Thanks  Talk
