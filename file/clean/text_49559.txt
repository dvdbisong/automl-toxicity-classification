BuddhaInside refusing to communicate with other users on your talk page by consitently blanking it is not in the spirit of Wikiquette and WikiLove which are fundamental concepts of the Wikipedia community Nor is your behavior on the silly List of heterosexuals You are welcome to make contributions to Wikipedia but if you continue with your current trolling it is likely that you will end up being banned Please focus on useful contributions instead of alienating other contributors Thank you Note that this page might be protected if you continue to blank it to guarantee that at least these messages are a matter of public record 0045 Sep 7 2003 UTC
