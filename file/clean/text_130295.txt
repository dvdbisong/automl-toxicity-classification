Well the article really only attacked one factual problem or rather factual controversy not mentioned uncertainty of his year of birth which I sort of addressed but should probably be mentioned specifically oh yeah the years he was Sec of Treasury too I think I didnt address that and was more of an attack on style and grammar I did a pretty quick proofread and edit of the article and there were some pretty egregious grammar punctuation captialization and punctuation problems Others should probably do the same my repair was rather cursory  1636 15 Nov 2004 UTC
