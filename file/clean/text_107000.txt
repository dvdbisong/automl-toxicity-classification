Marvels Best competition 

Lets be honest shall we Dcs  Man Of Steel was a semisuccess for DC seeing as they have tried for years to build a cinematic universe That cancelled 2008 Justice League film you dont want to think about but theyre trying to build their own universe in a fraction of the timeDCU theyre second film in the Batman Vs Superman will see the unification of the Justice League This is why the general public thinks DC will fail Marvel has work for years to create a substantial unique universeMarvel Cinematic Universe and Dc is throwing one together last minute because they can That also is why I think And hope that Dc will fail As in Mordecai box office bomb worthy fail Mordecai
