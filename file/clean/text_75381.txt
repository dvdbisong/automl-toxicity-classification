hiI just had read what you wrote on my talk page and this was my response back

Fair enough but then instead of just removing the whole thing why didnt you just change what I wrote to different genuses then     As far as my tone to be honest you seemed to have a tone in your edit reason where you removed my whole edit      And you seemed annoyed so I was just wondering why the seeming attitude       But yeah why couldnt you have altered what I wrote instead of removing the whole thing       Thats what Im kind of curious about Because my overarching point which IS true is that cougars are technically not lions and some people have asked about that       So couldnt you maybe just modify what I wrote instead of completely removing it
