Thanks I am glad you like the page I have added two more pictures of a pupa and a male emerging from the same pupa I would like to contribute to more butterfly articles from South Africa and will do so but am busy with several projects I have been contributing to the South African Butterfly Conservation Assessment project so have many photos  though some are not perfect quality I think the first thing to do is to make a page entitled South African Butterflies or List of South African Butterflies I have several caterpillars in my kitchen and am documenting the life cycle with photos  I also have a beautiful moth pupa from a bright yellow and black caterpillar I think it is a hawk moth I hope to make a page when it has hatched and been photographed and when I have found information to go with it
