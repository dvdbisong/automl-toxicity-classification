Why is their hardly any mention of Afhgnaistan being part of Ancient India 

If you click the article that says History of Afghanistan their is mention of Afghanistans connection with the Indus valley Civilazation which has to do with India And in this article and other articles their is mention how Afghanistan has Aryan heritage And has a history of Hinduism and Buddhism All of which I agree with But for some odd reason their is little mention that Afghanistan has a ethnic and cultural connection with the history and culture of India It doesnt make sense I mean if it has all these ties that I have mentioned doesnt that mean that Afghanistan has connections to the history and culture of India I am not saying it was part of the country Because in those days their were no boarders But wasnt it apart of the local Aryan people Before Islam werent many people Hindu and Buddhist then here water So wouldnt it be easier to just say that ancient Afghanistan has a connection to Ancient India And before you say no remmeber something when you click history of Afghanitan it mentions the connection with the Indus Valley Civiliazation So that is a connection with Ancient India isnt it So would anyone object to me making some changes
