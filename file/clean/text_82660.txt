Bold reversion 

Hey all I made a bold edit and reverted the last version to the version that existed November 3 2013 An intermediate IP editor 50785125 performed a copypaste job that resulted in the article becoming unambiguously promotional I was going to nominate it for speedy deletion then thought to check the edit history 

Of note to any passing admins I found this article because I was looking into edits made by 24019457 a New Jersey based IP with a history of disruptive edits in articles related to WinniethePooh that IP edited in this article IP 50785125 is also a New Jerseybased IP with a history of edits in articles related to WinniethePooh For more information see IP 692485286 Sockpuppet investigation
