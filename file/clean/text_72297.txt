Orangemike  I have no idea I hope so  but then again it doesnt matter if I walk the line within an inch of my life if some reviewer feels that I didnt do it sufficient enough to their liking theyll decline it If someone would just take a look at the article and see if I did what I needed to do especially in referencing articles books etc I would GREATLY appreciate it Until then I have to take my chances with whoever reviews it
