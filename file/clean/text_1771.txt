Genre changes 

Hi as you can imagine many people have very different opinions as to exactly what genre their favorite or least favorite band belongs in  The editing and reediting of genres is a never ending cycle on many Wikipedia pages  If you believe that the genre is not properly assigned to a band you may want to bring it up on an articles talk page and try to reach a consensus decision you may find that the discussion has already begun  At the bare minumum you should use references to back up your change  You dont want to be known as a genre troll If you have any questions please feel free to drop me a line on my talk page talk page
