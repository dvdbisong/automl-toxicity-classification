Disist making false claims in edit summaries and in messages on my talk
I started an entire section on the talkpage of TalkFascism specifically about you you have yet to reply to absoutely any of it at all you have yet to engage in the discussion I have come forward and brought together a long talkpage message concerning it but youre avoiding it We both know that you are simply playing a game by attempting to WPCENSOR Wikipedia As you are violating WPEDIT WPCITE and WPBLANK with your purging of over 70 sources

You are familiar with our policies so that is not that problem you know full well that wholesale reverting information with 70 sources is not acceptable and violates the above If you have a problem with specific parts of the text in the version Im developing all with sources then bring up the specific parts on the talk and Ill gladly discuss it with you However wholesale reverting hours of sources vertified information is just a violation of vandalism and you know it is not acceptable
