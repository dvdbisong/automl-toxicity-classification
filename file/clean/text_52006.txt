Comment on the question about including separate sections for health environmental and economic damage  I dont feel that it is appropriate for this article about BP to include these sections  I believe that the editors that have argued for including these sections have presented their arguments very well but it could also be argued that including such a brief summary as must be in one sense tends to minimize the issues  But mainly the information just seems out of place in this article to me
