Influence 

Rainbow band may have something that was taken from them to Power Metal I think mostly it split into DIO and Blackmores Night with booth have epic themes but they are definetly not Power Metal themself BTW Deep Purple count as inventors of Speed Metal which is the style from which Power progressed So my opinion is that Power got direct influence from Rainbow Deep Purple as was said and is stated in the article  Judas Priest and Iron Maiden DIO is primary more an influence or averypredecceccor of this style I think someone should add the influence list and transfer beforeHelloween bands there I could try but now am too busy
