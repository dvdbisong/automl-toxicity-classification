Undiscussed and copypaste move of M M Alam Road 

Recently you did an undiscussed and copy pasted move of the article to a new title This has two problems first by copy pasting the content to new title you effectively removed all edit history Second you did not show a rationale for the move nor any references that the new title ie one sans the periods is the correct one I have reverted your changes If you want to move please at least start a discussion on the article talk page
