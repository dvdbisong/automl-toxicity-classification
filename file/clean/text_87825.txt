 Platipig 

Why was this page marked for deletion   JimmyOne 
I marked Platipig for G3 for the following reasons in reverse order for some reason
The log shows that its already been deleted for G3
 the articles creator has a record of creating unconstructive pages
A quick google search made it clear that Platipigs dont exist If it existed there would be large amounts of news coverage due to the discovery of a new species of PlatypusPig hybrid
That answer your question at all Gamer 

Yeah Mistake on my part I reverted the removal of the tag and the page was deleted That result I found on Google was a blog which is not good enough My Apologies JimmyOne 
No problem I was bored anyways and I enjoy answering questions Gamer

 Image deletion 

Strictly speaking that image probably doesnt fit any speedy deletion criterion although some may find it qualified under a more liberal interpretation of the CSD My main justification for the deletion was a mixture of Ignore All Rules and the Snowball clause To answer your question you would  in all likelihood  not have been able to tag that image for speedy deletion and have an administrator that was judiciously following the criteria delete it The safest bet in the future would be to list such images at FfD where they will be deleted when the time is over perhaps sooner as in this case seresin 
I was watching your talk page you know Anyways that answers my question Happy editing Gamer

For your quick save on the article Coast Guard this 27th day of May 2009 It was definitely a righteous bust I wish we didnt have to spend the time we do correcting anonymous posters vandalism  Thanks again for your help   

Ironically if we didnt have vandals Id be out of a job here Thanks Gamer 

 Newgrounds 

I like and totally support your work on NG

  

Thanks but I dont think Im doing nearly as good a job as I should be Content writing doesnt seem to be my strong point Youre doing well too the encyclopedia in my opinion needs good writers more than it needs good vandal fighters Gamer 

 Difference between G1 and G3 

Hi there LegendGamer nice work with NPP Just saw you make a slight mistake at Matias trinidad while the page does meet the criteria for speedy deletion you used G1 which doesnt apply G1 refers to a page which is pure  gibberish ie a random string of letters such
