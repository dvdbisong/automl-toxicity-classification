This is a farce The Nervous Mermaid is wholly interested in Ralph Nader and has not commented on any other article in Wikipedia except for Seasons  a Muse Inc an article that has had only two contributors one of whom not coincidentally is 76166123129 who is often a commentator on the Ralph Nader article Meanwhile theres Telogen who only comments on Ralph Nader and one other article Jeanne Marie Spicuzza an article which also happens to be visited extremely often by user 76166123129 Would you guys cut this out  

The only evidence of conspiracy is that which youre creating It appears there are several editors myself included who disagree with your position so youre resorting to personal attacks Youre removing editors contributions that are sourced and accurate Youre admittedly trolling these editors histories then attacking them which is by Wikipedia standards bad faith The fact is Ive contributed to various articles some of which have existed for years Conspiracy Illuminati No Please stop the personal attacks Accept that your argument is unpersuasive and move on We can work together respectfully It will only serve to make Wikipedia as accurate and educational as it can be Shouldnt that be the goal
