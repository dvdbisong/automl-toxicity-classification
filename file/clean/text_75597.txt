No the facts are not clear at all It is silly to suggest we contact someone to verify  that misses the whole point of wikipedia  If this is the only way to verify then it is not notable enough to be in the encylopedia By the way there are no awards listed only a vague mention of numerous awards Facts that cannot be verified are not suitable for inclusion in an encylopedia Some facts thats can be verfied may still not be suitable for the encylopedia if they are not notable These numerous awards could well be in the latter category too  User14024715610 if you want them to be included then make a case  As it stands you have no case  Talk
