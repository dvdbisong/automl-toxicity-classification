updating 

Hey are you going to update the Masonic buildings articles where the NRIS reference is nonstandard  I happened to visit Masonic Temple Kingman Arizona article just now for other reason think it is one on your list  I dont mean to push you to do something you dont want to but I would appreciate your saying if you are going to clean these up or not  Thanks ncram
