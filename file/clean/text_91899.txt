Again I have listed a whole range of professors of history from leading Universities and others  and where are you getting your 90 v 10  Again the statement historians are divided is true and I have not seen anyone try to come up with actual percentages other than yourself The cliam most historians is a blank statement made by TJF and remains unsubstantiated If it could be found that only one or two scholars had a different opinion then the term most historians would be warranted This is far from the case
