I read the comment differently that you apparently and thats read in the present tense  Also as someone who is part of the LGBT community and has been intimately aware of AIDS and those with it since the early80s I can tell you that resentment isnt really accurate  Look Ive known more than 100 friends who have died from the disease  at least 23 of them dying in the 1980s the remainder in the early to mid1990s before the drugs got better and more effective over the longterm  There was a time when I was attending multiple funerals every month  I still know a good number of men who remain HIV positive but have somehow stayed alive with the disease for more than two decades  I can testify as a first handwitness that it wasnt resentment people in the gay community were feeling it was anger  And certainly not because of Ryan Whites openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease  The anger was directed largely at the US government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die died because of who they were and were being punished  Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS most certainly but I know of no one in the gay community and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isnt no matter how close they think they arewere to those in the queer world who felt resentment over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge  If anything the gay community and those with HIVAIDS within the gay community were elated that something was now going to be done while skeptical it might be shortlived andor selective yet still quite angry that when it was a gay disease it wasnt important enough for the POTUS to acknowledge
