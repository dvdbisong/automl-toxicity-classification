Inappropriate nonadmin closure of multiple articles 

Nonadmin UserNuclearWarfare closed as redirect a bunch of articles on Axis of Time characters WikipediaArticles_for_deletionJane_Willet_fictional_character WikipediaArticles_for_deletionMike_Judge_fictional_character WikipediaArticles_for_deletionJ_Lonesome_Jones_fictional_character WikipediaArticles_for_deletionKaren_Halabi_fictional_character even thoug all of the votes were delete I could support redirects to Characters_in_the_Axis_of_Time_Trilogy where these characters are already covered even though such redirects are of little use because a search for those names returns the Characters_in_the_Axis_of_Time_Trilogy article anyway but the redirects to Axis of Time make even less sense and were against consensus Im inclined to adjust the redirects just to avoid any drama but I thought to check with you first since you have lost of experience with the AfD process Thanks
