AntiSemiticism again 

As a casual reader of the article which is generally quite informative I found the the subsection on his antiSemiticism rather a letdown for this reason I was left wondering what exactly his views were Apparently he was not an anti_Semite in the sense of disliking individual jews So in what sense is this accusation  meant Perhaps he was actually antiZionist Anyway Id like someone with more knowledge of Belloc than I to clarify for us just what his antiSemiticism consisted of Thanks
