 Re How to pronounce maize 
My apologies  It appears that there is an attempt on the page to explain how to pronounce maize  there is an ei reference where the ei appears to be in a different font from the rest of the the sentence and that corresponds to a rhyming with days ie not rhyming with eyes But to the firsttime reader this is easy to overlook Perhaps with further experience with the Wikipedia pages I will not be so quick to jump to these conclusions of inadequacy  But for now suffice it to say that a casual browser of these pages can quite easily make the same mistakes that I have In other words it seems like a simple statement like rhymes with  would prevent such waste of time and resources Again my apologiesmea culpa
