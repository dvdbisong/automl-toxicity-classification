That is a fair and proper proposal and although at the moment I am as you can see from my contribs doing 100 things at once on this wikipedia alone I want to draw a few images or the CSS OPSEK in stages of progression and that old proposed 20 module that would have been on the nadir port of the ros forward of nauka I cant recall its name 
I do wonder however what will happen as the design progresses and changes like if I drew an image today to the best of my ability and tomorrow they announce 5 modules what would you do with the image  Assuming I draw another with 5 modules what happens to the 3 module version     2358 27 Jun 2012 UTC
