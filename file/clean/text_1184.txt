And 

Paganism

Southgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University rejected Catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition including the Odinic Rite the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A  satru Alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard Mike Murray a former member of the American Nazi Party91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins92 Southgate believed that Wotans celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of European spirituality culture and identity93 Another key expression of this identity is exhibited by Southgates interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II94

This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension Through the figure of Christ Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the weak continue to worship a dead Jew95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including Evola and Jung as an alternative path the West could have followed It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or latterly Himmlers SS which the NRF claims had its origins in various Anarchist droite  circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the Aryan psyche the awareness of Europes Faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene Guenon who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth96 For Southgate as for Evola Tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all97

Southgates discovery of Evolian Primordial Tradition and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene98 This cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of GothicIndustrial Dark Ambient Black and Viking Metal bands including Allerseelen Blood Axis Burzum Current 93 Dark Holler Death in June Endura Mayhem Ostara Puissance and Sol Invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing system Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging antiantiestablishment proBush rightwing punk movement100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews102

This is not simply cynical manipulation Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target His fanzine Tribal Resonance the voice of the racial avantgarde reveals Southgates strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the Nazis did through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance By creating cultural hegemony the groupuscular right believes it can forge the political space necessary for political and racial hegemony104
