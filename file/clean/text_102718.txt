Monster was developed on VMS  TinyMUD was developed on BSD Unix and very heavily inspired by Monster  BSD Unix used the ASHell or ASH not the Bourne Shell  Regardless the Bourne shell commentary would be incorrect since neither link unlink chown have anything whatever to do with what shell you are running  They happen to be Unix commands not shell builtins  I would be hard pressed to make the case that Monster LinkUnlink are inspired by VMS commands since LINK is the command to invoke the linkage editor ld on Unix and there is no Unlink  TinyMuds chown is clearly inspired by the Unix command  I really dont understand the significance of pointing out the obvious origins of a single TinyMUD command
