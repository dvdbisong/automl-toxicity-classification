no books are useless anybody can write a book and if you my friend have even half a brain you would realize that the text is completely outta this world and even if its not its biased

i highly doubt the book has that i know that book and i really dont think it involves a MAN ON THE MOON

unless a LINK is provided like the link disproving the malaysians comment its safe to assume its either a lie or half truth which means its not wiki worthy

its completely encyclopedic it wasnt written by me u know undefeated streak yes undefeatable yes theres no such streak in sports entertainment history its no lie no exxageration

yes theres no other type of streak that comes even near goldbergs streak it really is the undefeated undefeatable winning streak in sports entertainment history that book reference must be removed unless there is a solid link i have searched everywhere about a MAN ON THE MOON and other bad comments about DA MAN

by god if this is an edit war and all three of you gang upon me i will go HITLER on all of you sure ill make this article a living electronic text based hell but im commiting to making this article a featured article worthy article and aint nuthin gunna stop me i will semi protect this article and i will do it by not getting blocked i will make this article better and i will add more watchers you will all be amazed if you go up against me in a handicap match D
