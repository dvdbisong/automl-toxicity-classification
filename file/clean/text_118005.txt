CMB  

HI Ive appreciated your responses on this topic but these   have been difficult for me to understand Im thinking that perhaps my confusion stems from arguments Ive heard that physics is local which might mean limiting inertial reference frames to specific and very localized lattices I ask because I do think of these frames as extending uniformly to infinity and I cannot think of a proper reference frame lattice varying over distances in any significant way Another possible source of confusion I dont know if this is the case but as I said Im at a lost to understand your reply is perhaps you are thinking Hubbles law isnt uniform when AFAIK is supposed to involve a spatially uniform expansion observers in different parts of the observable universe should be currently observing basically the same distant red shifts and law
