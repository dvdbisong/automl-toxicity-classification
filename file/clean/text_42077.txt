I suspected as much But this object has a parallax of 250 and new research gives its distance as 130 light years which puts it slap bang in the middle of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs at position 31 unless other objects have the wrong distances in that list It is closer than at least eight other brown dwarfs that do each have pages of their own In fact its the only one of Marsh2012s 11 Y dwarfs that doesnt have its own Wikipedia article Even worse the link to this Brown Dwarf from the page to which its redirected directs back to its redirection giving a closed loop The WISE 05357500 Wikipedia page should never have been removed in the first place
