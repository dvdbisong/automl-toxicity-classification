OurMed
Hi My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and Im on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called OurMed

At OurMed were committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself

We launched the Wikipedia version last year OurMeds Site  and this year were adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical researchtools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers You can have a peek at our new design here Our New Site in Development

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site the new one will emphasize noncommercial unbiased informationall entirely free The organization is governed by a nonprofit Board made up of Healthcare professionals the former head of Wikipedia Florence Devouard former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals

Heres a short video of our plans httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvCjAqbMl1dVk

Thank you
