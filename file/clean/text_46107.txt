Resolution

I am under the impression that the article as it currently stands is fine on the sciencebeliefs front

On the political activities front we have two options

Include the sourced material about Lerners break with LaRouche
Remove all political activities as being nonnotable

I do not have  a preference for either Please indicate your preferences below along with a coherent argument as to why you chose the way you did
