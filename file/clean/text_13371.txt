Any news 

Hello there Any news from the board of directors 
Oops sorry about that I meant the experts you refered to on handling the subject of copyright rules and regulations 
Tomorrow is the day when my images will be deleted from Wikipedia so what will happen next Im sure that I would at least be able to use my own paintings with my written article since there is no reason for me to prohibit myself from using these pictures
But if we get no instructions whatsoever of how to go about things I see no other option than to abort any inclusion of images with the article and just make it a plain written one based on the notes which I have delivered so far Or what is your outlook on this
