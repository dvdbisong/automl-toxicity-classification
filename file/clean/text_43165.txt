Yes I wasnt denying that that was a consequence but I just think to mention that but not the occupation is a major oversight I dont think its really arguable that the most longlasting and significant consequence has been the illegal occupation which continues to this day That has been the source of conflict for over 40 years with incalculable repercussions I suggest adding after the above sentence

 Another lasting consequence of the war that has had enormous repercussions and which helped establish the Six Day War as a watershed event in the Middle East was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory which continues to this day

Thats perhaps not as brief as you were looking for but I think this is crucial and its importance cannot be overstated It deserves at least one sentence in the lede I suggest concluding the lede with this Ive worded it in a way that wont be controversial or require sourcing
