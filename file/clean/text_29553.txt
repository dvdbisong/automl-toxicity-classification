You are right concerning the WPSYNTH So I added a text based on Morris Note that Morris says The immediate propellants to flight were the popular Arab hostility including pogroms triggered by the war in Palestine and specific governmental measures amounting to institutionalized discrimination against and oppression of the Jewish minority communities while the next lines are specifying a long list of reason  of which the persecution is one of them Hence it is misleading by minimizing the impact of the persecutions on the Jewish emigration
 Is there a source for the political instability influence
 Is there a source for the highlight good relations between the Jewish communities and their countrys governments  Morris 2008 p 70 say that the UN partition resolution changed the situation to the worst
