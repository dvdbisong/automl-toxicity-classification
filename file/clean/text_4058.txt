Well put QG very rarely works towards consensus or compromise and goes well beyond attempting to portray his idea of mainstream POV he tries to bury articles in twisted versions of cherry picked sources with no respect to weight to make them look ridiculous The fact that you think the subjects themselves are ridiculous is not justification for overthetop tendentious editing  I truly am convinced by his editing habits that he and PPdd are one in the same person An editor that active with such an ownership complex might have multiple usernames Those of you asking for diffs to justify the block seriously just look at any talk page discussion he partakes in
