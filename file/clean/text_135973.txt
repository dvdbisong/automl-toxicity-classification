Im sorry that you have come to the erroneous conclusion that I dont understand the issue at hand even after I took the time to explain to you at length the true situation Perhaps you can confirm that your edit summary at 1 and 2 was coordinate test If it was something else please provide the relevant diffs If you didnt really say we should avoid starting to use this one until we are sure we want it please says so so that we can find out who entered thsoe words in your name on WTGEO If you didnt label coordinate as Currently not implemented pelase say so os that we can find ut who labelled created the templates documentation with those words in an edit seemingly made from your account If you do not do so I shall consider the matter closed

With regard to your numbered points above

 Thank you for confirming that my revert didnt break the template it was already broken If you repaired it you should have said so in your edit summary rather than just labelling it coordinate test If you wished to repair it and implement a test you would have been wise to do so in to separate and clearly labelled  edits so that your test could be reverted separately
 Ditto
 Your use of should here is incorrect should expresses a advisory or mandatory position you are expressing an opinion 
 You again make a pejorative and fallacious insinuation that my understanding is deficient Kindly desist You also ignore my point about the data provided at GeoTemplate 

Your claim that my reversal of your test edits clearly labelled as such is POINT is mistaken anyone can see in edit histories that I have replaced every instance of coordinate in article space including the majority not initiated by you The were not 10000 instances of coordinate as you well know Likewise my edits to implement a standard template in place of one deprecated by consensus Since you were the only person opposing that consensus the POINT edits seem to be yours My edit history shows multiple instances of me converting other coordinates templates on pages you have not edited Kindly desist from making false slurs If you have any evidence to support your slurs take the matter back to WPANI where my edits contested by you have already been described as fine not least in the light of your incivility and disruptive editing  UserPigsonthewing Andys talk Andys edits
