polish Nobility 

your list is very short you dont even link it to the polish clans most of the clan pages have the family names under their clan sites also princes barons counts etc are church given titles a prince is equal to the poorest noble in every way nobility was gifted by god and witnessed by man a king had the honor of giving a person their paper of nobility he couldnt give nobility in a family a person can be adopted in nobility be they will be under that family not under the Sejm There is a lot of history written to destroy the polish history if a German or Russian government says anything it not true the invader must never be given words over the people he invaded that would be like saying the rapist words have more value then the woman being raped 

Everywhere online I see these with anything polish free the golden freedom when the partition moved in and killed thousands of people and raped the land and ruled with a iron fist how is that freedom too the Nazi propaganda as some kind of fact Germany hated Poland 1260 or around there when the Germans started killing Jews for the black plague and Poland gave them a safe haven

Every Man and Woman that is born of a noble is noble given by god and even if your not catholic it truth of szlachta Poland was a pagan and catholic country for over 500 years the pagan side was for life and the catholic was for death the church did not like it being duality but having the worlds strongest army they couldnt change it  

Thanks
