Moving Ahead 
I just found that I am unblocked now This block reminded me of HkelkarBakasuperman combination who used to get me blocked very often in very similar fashion The longest block so far Perhaps longer ones are in the way People have already threatened it on my talk page Well If I get challenged I feel more determination One shocking fact I recently learnt is WPANI is up again We had got it deleted earlier It was WPANI if I remember correctly I had proposed it has the potential of becoming another Fundywatchlist which many others accepted and it got deleted For those who are unaware of what Fundywatchlist was I would like to elaborate it was a page on wikipedia itself to discuss the ways to harass some users and POVise the pages in the name of cleaning and improvement Members included were some Indian Admins and a bunch of like minded users who used to discuss whom to target and how to achieve their ends It got deleted and slowly the admins involved were shown the way out However these people started getting smarter and found userYellowmonkey alias blnguyen an American Vietnamese as their mask This guy was very popular among Indian circle and was acknowledged as good troubleshooter though I always smelled something different Hkelkar was in his good books and once in a rv war on Kancha Ilaiah article where hkelkar was hell bent on writing a libellous term in lead he went to the extent of not only protecting the page rv in his favor but also shamelessly declared I have protected the page for you After that Ben W Bells Dispute Resolution started who neglected my request to remove the term first saying he cannot unprotect the page protected by a different admin Majority ruling made Hkelkar the winner No actually He didnt win I left the page forever because everybody was against me there Blnguyen wrote a note there just below my unprotect request I didnt know it has stuck However what happened afterwards is more interesting I requested checkuser on Hkelkar and tagged him as sockpuppeteer Blnguyen ritualistically blocked me for bogus tagging  you can check my block log and lo both checkuser and arbcom decision was in my favor Since then blnguyen has never been shameless enough to look into my eyes I could have raised finger on him during arbcom though I dropped this idea later on because one thing was evident Blnguyen was not a bad person he was into bad company Going through the talks above I get the same feeling about many nonindian users here 

While going thru the article I could find few anomalies 1 Ahirs claim descent from Abhira of central Asia  I have never read such a sentence anywhere else If you are quoting jafferlot he didnt use the word claim If you are quoting Hiralal  Rusell they are very much clear that Ahir is just a corruption of word abhira From where this idea come s I would like to be educated I find it rather funny because you are saying they are claiming what they actually are and that too from central asia I couldnt get the head and tail of it Some indian languages still call them abhira Translate this into one of them and sentence becomes Abhira claim descent from Abhira What a nonesense
2 Usage of word Yadavas in one of the quotes for present day Yadavs Here I have always said both words are same and means the same thing You are yourself using it interchangeably in the article  But why you are confusing the readers by artificially creating two titles You cannot adopt a convention which is not in sync with real life usage Sanskrit word Krishna can also be written as Krsna with few dots above and below different alphabets however they are still same If you want to differentiate present day Yadvas from ancient ones better tag it as scriptural or mythical 
3 Saying present day yadvas came into existence only after sanskritisation movement Now tell me didnt British census record them as Ahir and gwal in different parts Were they not Yaduvanshi before that  Isnt it true that ancient sanskrit text Amarkosa calls Gopa gwal and ballabha are Abhira synonym and you still say they are a bunch of unrelated people In fact we have many evidences for equating ahir with yadav and MSA Rao summarizes them into two categories1 Historical and 2 semihistorical I would like to learn why you keep on removing them I didnt wrote MSA Rao says this because he is not the only one so it was unnecessary If you want you may dig deeper into earlier version of the article it contains the link to snippet view of his statement too 
4 Too much emphasis on Jafferlot and completely ignoring Nesfield  HA RoseFYI the later carries more weight than Jafferlot Jafferlot is rather infamous for his misunderstanding of AhirYadav His recent comment on Babulal Gaurs statement exposes him where he says B
