Response I have no doubt that your citations are based on fact But these facts and the associated citations are not directly relevant to what the CTMU actually says and therefore cannot be included on that basis Rather they are relevant to 
Intelligent Design andor ISCID andor the IDevolution controversy and should be included if at all in those entries PCID apparently published the CTMU paper despite its clear affirmation of evolution because ISCID is tired of being accused of having a Creationist agenda and therefore wishes to display openmindedness Presumably this is also why Langan was invited to be a Fellow of that organization Whether or not those who rule over ISCID have a Creationist agenda is not the issue here all that matters is that 1 they say they dont which means that Langan is not embracing Creationism by being an ISCID Fellow and 2 that the CTMU in fact accommodates evolution as Langan has repeatedly stated Therefore the CTMU cannot be labeled as Creationism or identified with the views typically promoted by Creationist organizations
