As WPCONSENSUS says 

In determining consensus consider the quality of the arguments the history of how they came about the objections of those who disagree and existing policies and guidelines The quality of an argument is more important than whether it represents a minority or a majority view The arguments I just dont like it and I just like it usually carry no weight whatsoever

Id really appreciate it if youd join the discussion Im having with BGwhite above about specific formatting issues
