I agree with the above post The explosion at the end of the film was absolutely not a nuclear explosion The monster was right over them at the ending and if it was a nuclear weapon the screen would have just gone blank Also the tape would have been completely incinerated It was heavy heavy bombing not a nuclear option Perhaps multiple JDAMS At any rate I agree that the wiki should be corrected accordingly
