From Kind Singaporean to SG man 
I already stated earlier that the information I gave was true right up to 2003 thus this article is a piece of history a recollection of things and experiences that are already passed

There have been a lot of changes in the SPF in the 2 years since then many of which I am not aware of Guess LSF had experienced a wind of change by now who knows

Besides during my years there LSF regularly used the parade square in SOC for their drills and other training purposes and I guess they still do today All these could be witnessed by residents in nearby HDB blocks with their naked eyes Thus LSF activities and goingons then were no secret Any Tom Dick and Harry from outside could take a peek on us

In view of these I strongly believe that publishing this article is appropriate I know wheres my OB markers are I thank SG man for his concern 14 January 2006
