Anti England sentiment by editors
I have noticed that a lot of information on this article is regularly being deleted particularly any which presents England in a positive sence I have also noticed that a lot of this information being deleted on a regular basis is done so by editors who on their talk pages have very pro Celtic statements and their contributions list shows they regularly contribute to Cetlic related articles which I checked were always contributed to in a positive manner incontrast to their negitive edits of England related articles Can this AntiEngland sentiment from what looks like users who are from Ireland Scotland Wales and Celtic sympathizers in the USA please be stopped and if needs be reported so that further damage to this article cannot be allowed to continue I fear if left to their own devices theyll cut this article down to nothing more than a stub
