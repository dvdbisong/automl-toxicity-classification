I was trying to inject some humour as evidenced by my winky face in this ridiculous overblown and unnecessarily dramatic situation If you took the time to familiarize yourself with the situation you would see that the person I insulted was attacking my cited and factual contributions by actively censoring them no explanation which I retaliated with by insulting him I thought that his conduct was insultworthy at the time as would any sane individual who was not familiar with Wikipedias noinsult rule however I have since realized that what I did was wrong because this site does not allow for harsh words which is why I will not use them again even if they are used against me which they were during this ordeal

Wikipedia is the place for me because my edit was constructive and brought a greater knowledge to the subjects topic But the fact that I insulted another user in the edit summary is regrettable and I know that now

If you seriously think the edit linked above constitutes a better insult
