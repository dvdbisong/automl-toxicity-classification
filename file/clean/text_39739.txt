In response to Claudes last two posts  Backwards of course  Regarding NRMs  if youll check the list youll see that Assemblies of God Calvary Chapel Foursquare and CMA are all considered both NRMs and denominations  Just a note  Also true of the Vineyard Movement of which there are many comparisons to GCA  Youre right that GCC doesnt like the denominational nametag   but just like Vineyard many outsiders consider it to be and there is little actual semantic difference  As far as what a movement is a couple definitions I found were a diffusely organized or heterogeneous group of people or organizations tending toward or favoring a generalized common goal the antislavery movement the realistic movement in art and An organized effort by supporters of a common goal a leader of the labor movement
 I say all that to say this  Movement is a very ambiguous term more appropriate to an idea  Youre right that GC does use the term frequently  However I think the best factual definition and most suitable for our purposes and for accuracy within the title and intro is GCAC is an association of churches  Thats what the AC in GCAC stands for  Really thats what we actually see in existence  churches  Somehow we need to differentiate  I think we need to start with definiing the article as about an association of churches because we have to pick a topic  that is one thing plaguing us at present as editors  So lets start with something real then trace the history of that association and the present
 I will reedit the Today section  It is not NPOV at present  What I objected to was not the quote but rather your original sentence before it  I was confused about the date couldnt find it in your reference I was in a hurry  We need to focus on what were doing here  were putting facts up  We dont need to interpret or extrapolate  That quote from Bovenmeyer seems to be about  church leadership with one sentence relating that to autonomy  For that reason while I think it should stay it would be wrong to put that forth as the best description of the GC view of autonomy and congregational polity since neither of those is the topic      Again your statement isnt found in the quote  The quote itself is fine and appropriate  i dont see any reason that it needs a qualifier  as the quote i put above from the cong polity article says leadershipauthority is a common integral part of cong polity and as we all have said there is no typical view  if were going to have cong polity as a term in the GCA article people need to go there and read it also someone needs to put some serious work in on that article  I dont have any problem with  deferring to leaders  i just want accuracy here  Also note that there is a difference between an article in an official publication by one man and an official stance of the org which is listed in several places especially given the independence and autonomy of the churches within GCA
