yes this article should be deleted but it was created by a guy who has 2 of the GA articles in wikipedia i just hope the other 150 articles are not as ridiculous as this
my point is its impossible to take it to WPAFD since Tony made it a GA and plans to keep his good record
my god an article that has no relevance is now a good article because of a whim because tony wanted to have one more article on his trophy shelf19016243184
