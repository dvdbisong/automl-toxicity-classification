he helped inaugurate the national haiku societies of several countries 

This article is coming together nicely Ive been toning down some of the more overenthusiastic language and adding citations and am now trying to find refs to he helped in 2000 inaugurate the national haiku societies of several countries Australia Bulgaria Macedonia Serbia Slovenia which is a fairly substantial claim and so needs support On the about page at the website of the Australian Haiku Society mention of Kacian is curiously absent and we read simply In December 2000 Australian haiku enthusiasts banded together to form HaikuOz regarding Slovenia we read on the site of the German Haiku Society that The Haiku Club of Slovenia HCS was set up in September 1997 ie 3 years prior to Kacians trip in Serbia there are two societies the Aleksandar Nejgebauer Haiku Club was formed in 1993 according to their page on Templibres and the Serbian Haiku Society was founded in 2004 according to this page on Tempslibres According to this page on WHC the Bulgarian Haiku Club was formed in 1999 

In light of all the above were going to need something more than a statement from Kacian himself if we want to retain this claim Can anyone help
