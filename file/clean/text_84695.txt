 Watchlist
Hi thanks for the invite  I see from your page that you are semiretired  so am I I plink on occasional articles but hardly have a watchlist  too timeconsumingexhausting  

I am very annoyed that WP doesnt have a system to keep out idiots like UserAboutmovies above  The guy comes in vandalizes an article he knows absolutely nothing about provokes an argument and then goes on his merry way  Now Im an idiot too and have probably embedded hundreds of mistakes into WP articles but these were accidental and not brazen  

Id like to see a system that allows factions such as WPWPM or WPWPCS to put a seal of approval on certain versions of an article  The idea is that ordinary users can make edits but only subjectmatter experts can place a seal of approval on the latest version  This would help keep subtle vandalism such as that by Aboutmovies at bay
