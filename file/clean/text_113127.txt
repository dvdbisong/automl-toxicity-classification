John Peel
Thanks Wikiklrsc I had forgotten that hed phoned in an article to the Liverpool Echo though at the time he had pretended to be a reporter
On the 1st Marriage I dont know why youve modified my edit on that as it is accurate source Peels autobiography  a few websites You say the modification was due to being unclear on the motivation of prior edits by AllanHainey  my motivation is to have a full  complete wikipedia entry I will check Peels autobiography tonight for more details  readd info on this as a 1st marriage especially to a 15 year old is a significant part of his life  should be included If youve got any objection or reason not to include this we can discuss it on the talk page
Thanks for confirming the computer programmer bit  I hadnt seen any reference to it on the web or autobiography so I assumed it was false
