US Inventions before the US existed 
What is the rationale for having inventions from before July 4 1776 in the article It seems quite odd to me so am I missing something   

It is no more less odd than inventions added to the Chinese inventions page before the Peoples Republic of China came into existence in 1949 Hence if that were the case then China can only add inventions to their list from the year 1949 and onwards

Likewise prolific inventors such as Bejamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were and became American citizens after independence was declared
