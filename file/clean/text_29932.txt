In my opinion the section is okay bin Ladens death is certainly going to have major effects on countriesgroups involved namely US Pakistan and alQaeda Yes US and Pakistan arent the only countries in the world but they are no doubt the major players in this event So having sections that focus particularly on these 2 countries is completely appropriate However should we add such a section right now No we shouldnt when we dont even know for sure what those effects arect
