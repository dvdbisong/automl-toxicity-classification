New Orleans 

15 During this period Oswald began to consider returning to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba There is a no source cited here because it is impossible to know Oswalds considerations We can hypothesize but it is better to present the facts and let the reader do their own thinking The statement is not fair because it grasps at the bounds of the imagination by assuming that the Mexico trip took place Since that entire incident was even questioned by the Warren Commissions own investigator  into the incident Wesley Liebeler the alleged Mexico trip cannot be used as basis for the conclusion that Oswald wanted to move to Russia or Cuba

16 The pamphlet trial got news media attention There was no trial Oswald pled guilty to disturbing the peace and paid a 10 fine Warren Report vol XXV p117 Exhibit 2216 The ARREST go media attention Notably absent from the wikipedia paragraph is his strange relationship with FBI Agent John Lester Quigley the first person to visit Oswald in jail

17 Jim Garrison in his unsuccessful attempt to link Oswald to wealthy local businessman Clay Shaw His attempt was very successful HSCA noted the credibility of Garrisons link from Shaw to Oswald It called the Clinton witnesses whom saw the two together The Committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant HSCA Report page 171

18 Concerning Oswald and David Ferrie However there is no credible evidence they had any significant contact when Oswald was a teenager The source cited is footnote 72 HSCA vol IX p103115 While it would be correct to quote HSCAs conclusion it is an outright lie to state this as a fact In addition to the photo of Ferrie and Oswald together the Warren Commission took the testimony of Oswalds high school classmates Fredrick O Sullivan WC vol VIII p 27 and Edward Vobel WC vol VIII p1 whom both testified to 15 year old Oswald and Ferrie meeting Why would the Warren Commission be asking specifically about Ferrie if there was no credible evidence There is also no mention of Ferries motive for being with the teenage CAP He would attempt to recruit teenage boys to molest Both pro and anti conspiracy researchers including the Warren Commission have questioned Oswalds sexuality due to his association with gay men in New Orleans

19  The Clinton witnesses contained numerous contradictions to their testimony at the Clay Shaw trial in 1969 and to their testimony to the Committee in 1978 Wikipedia editors hypocritically claim there is not enough space to include all facts and theories yet there is plenty of space to attack the Clinton LA witnesses again and again and again and again and again Worse yet this statement is NOT in quotations as a conclusion of Gerald Posner as cited in Footnote 73 It is written in the article as an objective fact If you are going to use statements from Posner then put them in quotations as HIS conclusions NOT facts

 
 Return to Dallas 

20 Oswald was last seen by a coworker alone on the sixth floor of the Depository about 35 minutes before the assassination Another outright lie Footnote 84 has cited the Warren Commission testimony of Charles Givens The last witness to affirmatively see Oswald before the assassination was Carolyn Arnold in the lunch room at 1215 WC vol XXII p 635 She was also interviewed by reporter Anthony Summers in Conspiracy page 108 This lie speaks volumes as to Wikipedias intentions They would rather mention a less significant witness simply to get in the statement of a brown bag

  
In Crossfire Jim Marrs attempts to present an even more detailed hypothesis for Oswalds movements before the assassination but much of this is based on loose interpretations of witness statements

It is very significant that Oswald was the ONLY employee whom did not eat their lunch outside or by a window in anticipation of the motorcade Instead he stuck deep inside the depository in the 2nd floor lunchroom by the only accessible phone The same room he was found in only 90 seconds after the assassination by Roy Truly and ML Baker In The Day Kennedy Was Shot Jim Bishop claimed Oswald salivated for 30 minutes by the sixth floor window awaiting the motorcade This is obviously contradicted by both Carolyn Arnold and Bonnie Ray Williams whom ate his lunch by the assassination window until 1215 or 1220 before joining his friends on the 5th floor His chicken bones were later found by police CWC
