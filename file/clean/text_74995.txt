Issues on Banned IP 

Howdy

My names Mark and Im typing from TransportSA a state government agency here in Sunny well sort of sunny South Australia

Noticed that this IP has been banned due to vandalism and if I could would highly recommend that you contact Internode about this  Internode has been around as an ISP here in SA for a very very long time and has a reputation of doing the right thing  Could I recommend you contact Simon Hackket at SimonInternodeonnet  Hes the CEO of the business and a very active and involved person  It may be quite possible that he could initiate some action against the actual vandal if you are able to provide a clean time and date that the offending IP did its work  I think actions like this would be against the agreement made with Internode on fair use

In any case hes a great guy who just wont ignore the issue

Hope this helps

Regards
