Obama was not aware that Rezko may have been doing anything illegal when accepting the campaign contributions  Huh  How can you assume this  This is not a fact this is your impression of the situation  This article is totaly biased and spun to reflect Obama in a positive light  How is the Priest with a following of 8000 people whom Mr Obama chose to join in prayer not a HUGE part of his life  This is a storey of his good deads not abiography his life and what shapped him

I am totaly new to this I am not a sockwhatever that is supposed to be or some fake account as SCjessey claims anyone whos opinion differs from his own must be  WTF I used to think Wiki was a good thing but how can some fan boy be in charge of a page that people are looking to for information about who they might pick in an election  I came trying to get a grasp of who this guy Obama is because the media in the USA is selling copy using his name not telling us who he really is  Sadly I must continue to look for an unbiased source of facts as this wiki is far from unbiased
