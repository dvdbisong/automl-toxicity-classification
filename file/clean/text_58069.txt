Feedback on templates 

Hi there

I was speaking of infoboxes and templates in general having none specifically in mind but rather they excessive sprinkling throughout the site I just realized however that it is not as invasive here as on the French one my port of call so to speak I only came here to steal the code for the picture of Beef Stroganoff where they literally use templates for anything even dates or notsolarge 100 numbers  but then these guys didnt offer me the chance to complain about it But then even on the English version I would find that seeing the box code first thing when I open a page for edition is kind of a deal breaker

Thanks anyway for the quick reply much appreciated I see someone already gave you a bunch of barnstars for that keep up the good work

Best regards   

PS since Im at it I should say I also have a hard time understanding why editing is in Times New Roman while articles are in Arial or Helvetica sans serif Just sayin
