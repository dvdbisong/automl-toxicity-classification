Concern
my concern is that it is NOT fair for san salvador to be the only central american country with a crime section if one must have one then someone or i need to take the time and make one for each and every central american country until then i dont and im sure many wont consider it right for san salvador to be targeted like that when every country has crime and fyi crime in san salvador has drastically gone down and i do have articles from newspapers that i can provide that have facts on crime and how it has gone down and how san salvador and el salvador period is safe enough as safe as the US is meaning there is certain areas like california has compton butthat odesnt mean the entire country is like that
