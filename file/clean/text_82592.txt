Hello  While there had been some discussion here about whether your username met Wikipedia policy on what usernames editors can use the result was to allow it and that discussion has now been closed If you would like to see what concerns were raised you can still find that discussion in the archive  You do not need to change your username However if you ever wish to do so it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under a new name simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page rather than creating a whole new account Thank you    Need help Ask me
