Decided to delete some of the older material seeking to distinguish genre fiction from other forms of fiction that have common elements The definition and conventions of genre are discussed under their own headings

Also deleted material suggesting that genre conventions are essentially a timesaver for writer and reader not having to define or explain certain things It seems rather that the stability of genre conventions comes from the fact that readers like those elements rather than that they are simply familiar with them

Deleted the heading Genre in general since this material is covered in the separate article for genre

Deleted the paragraph discussing fantasy fiction and its evolution since this is covered in depth in the Fantasy fiction article

Still working on the heading The evolution of fiction genres Its a work in progress
