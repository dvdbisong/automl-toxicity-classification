Whilst Dr Beck asked only that we take down the BDIII I still have to pay 4 a copy for the original BDII so I must assume thats under copyright and licence as well Im going to try and find some relevant bits from WPC to justify or not removing the links From what I can see the relevant text is here 
Linking to copyrighted works
External sites can possibly violate copyright Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone elses copyright If it is please do not link to the page Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States Intellectual Reserve v Utah Lighthouse Ministry Also linking to a page that illegally distributes someone elses work sheds a bad light on us If the site in question is making fair use of the material linking is fine
From what I can tell I think that the sites that are hosting the BDII and BDIII are violating copyright Most of them dont say that they have permission to use the instrument they dont cite the original paper and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually but it seems unlikely A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects I dont think there is an exemption for educational use but then university psychology departments often buy a portfolio of test copyrights for limited use This would not normally extend to use on the web however In terms of next steps I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go but rather we could list the issue at WPCP
If its an issue of helping depressed people Im not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good After all it just produces a number its only useful in context One option would be to have a link to a therapeutic community as these may be of some help  For instance MoodGym is a site which allows users to selfadminister cognitive behavioral strategies 
Will go next to typewritten letter from Oliver Sacks about cycad toxicity in Guam and the link to ALS
