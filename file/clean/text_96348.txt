Unauthorised change 

On 26 January 2014 ie just in the last few weeks UserMzilikazi1939 changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the English language to CEBCE As he well knows this violates WPMOS specifically WPERA which requires that any change to an articles date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with articlespecific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed As is clearly evident to everyone none of these steps have taken place in this case

Instead in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queens English and CEBCE Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 260114 Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously May 2012 to January 2014 those comments were never enough to justify the change to CEBCE even back then This is of course because as mentioned earlier WPERA requires that articlespecific reasons be given and consensus established Neither occured then What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it The discussion went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queens English which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then to CEBCE therefore didnt proceed at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure

If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CEBCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process Stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing
