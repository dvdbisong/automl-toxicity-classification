Policy references and wiki syntax 

My apologies too tired and too rushed I guess I really need to get into the habit of previewing my changes because quite apart from confusing  and  my typing is not too accurate either meaning that a simple edit can take two or three goes if I hit the save page button too quickly Mea culpa Thanks for pointing it out
