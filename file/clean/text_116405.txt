East Timor Report 
Perhaps this news story could be included in the statement about East Timor It might add an important opposing view of Downers support of East Timors freedom and I quote A report to the United Nations has found Australia actively lobbied to delay East Timors independence ballot in 1999 and prevent its separation from Indonesia and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer made it clear it would be preferable if Timor remained legally part of Indonesia and actively lobbied the government in Jakarta to delay the independence vote
