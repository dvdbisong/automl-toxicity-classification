POVinaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses There were French borrowings but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians for example There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians compared to the Romanized GhetoDacians in Romania The fact is that both Moesians and GhetoDacians were the Thracian tribes so the substrate was not so different 

Yes most linguists think that Moesians and GetoDacians spoke the same language labeled by some DacoMoesian but thats offtopic here Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense Its absurd to say that some are descendants from GetoDacians and others from the Moesians

Anyway the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language I mean even the same dialect The southern Wallachian dialect is what became standard Romanian language 

Some Vlachs usually emphasize that the difference between them and Romanians are the same as the difference between the Serbs and Bulgarians

So Serbian language is identical to Bulgarian  I learnt something new today then
