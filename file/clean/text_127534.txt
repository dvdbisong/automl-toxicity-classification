Retirement for want of a better word 

Hi all I just thought Id drop a line to mention that I will no longer be an overseer and that my position will now be in the very and far more capable hands of Shreshth91 who has offered to become an overseer Things have become quite busy of late and I havnt really been that active here lately either so Im afraid Ill have to step down so to speak Id love to get involved at a later date as a judge perhaps or even a candidate  Cheers guys it looks like this project has a great future Thanks for everything  s
