As somewhat of an aside perhaps dont get me wrongI fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community adopting its minhagim as his own  This is the ruling according to Beth Yosef  So when Ashkenazim have settled there they should have become an integral part of the Bukharan community as Bukharans  The real aside is the egregious nature of the establishment of the Rishon LeTziyon Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi baaretz in contravention of halakha  The reason I ask is because there seems to be a concentration on these individuals with apparently Russified names if not originally Ashkenazim themselves and the native Bukharans apparently warrant no mention  Did the Russian Jews that seriously dominate the locals economically or did the Bukharans Russify their surnames in order to ingratiate themselves to their Russian domineers  That is the question Im asking  talk
