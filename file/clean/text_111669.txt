I disagree Including ambiguous names is not helpful especially where there are unambiguous names that have already been introduced to the reader The fact that fishermen use other names doesnt mean that we have to in this context It doesnt make sense to switch from justifiably calling it Crangon crangon in one section to brown shrimp in another It significantly reduces the coherence of the whole article I havent removed or altered any of the statements you have added merely reformatted them to fit the context Feel free to change the section heading but dont introduce vague terminology where it isnt needed
