discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations 

hi
I observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals It seems that these weeks there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots One example is whether to standardize Thai royal persons Of course Thai and Japanese are totally different for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc and should probably be as separate as Eastern are in relation to european royalty naming I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that However discussions may give new ideas andor give reinforcement and more arguments for existing reasoning Would you see the arguments and votes at Wikipedia talkManual of Style Thailandrelated articles and do you have any opinion
