F13 in 2009 

I saw that you edited Friday the 13th 2009 so I wanted to let you know that per notability guidelines for films the articles existence is not yet warranted  It doesnt use the correct naming conventions either so theres no reason to keep it  Id suggest putting relevant content of this future film in Friday the 13th franchiseFuture if it doesnt exist there already  talk  contrib
