Filling out the article 

Who started filling out this article  Do you think a section on interpretation should be added  There is plenty to run on because of the dialectic between magic and science  In this film I think its cool how science saves the day where usually in movies science is kept in the Frankenstein corner  

What about a section on the animation  In the discussion people already added a lot enough that could be added to the article

Can you think of other sections
