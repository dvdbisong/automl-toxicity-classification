Mentorship 

Hi Sylvia Id certainly be happy to mentor you I can provide as much or as little support as you need  If youd just like a single point of contact for questions Ill be able to help with that If youd like something a little more structured I can even adopt you  Id probably not recommend that option if you were not planning to hang around after the 6 weeks so you can see how you feel and possibly join that later Anyway yes Im happy to mentor you Â  talk
