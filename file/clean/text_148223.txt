Youve made a mistake I was pointing out that those described as black are underrepresented on this site It you go to the Talk Page of the Big Bill Broonzy article you will read a post I left in January of 2013 where I mentioned this issue No one asked women if they wanted the vote  it was the Suffragettes who put the proposal on the table Now that women in Egypt have the vote does that mean we should disenfranchise them because the European Suffragettes from one hundred years ago didnt ask them if they wanted to be represented I was pointing out in the examples given above that representation is not served by those who are not of the group seeking representation and that representation itself is a form of dialogue that does not arrive fully formed Airline pilots work in consultation with the civil aviation authority to improve and implement safety measures for air travel and this affects all who travel by air People what we have here is someone who read into my post what they wished to see written and not what was actually written I also highlighted at the Broonzy Talk Page that this issue is a point of divergence between Wikipedia editors I mentioned in the post above that this needs to be discussed here because we all of us here regardless of background genetics need to ask those who are being described as black if they wish to join this site to affect the consensus guideline Anyway you boring me now with your lack of original ideas  bring something of your own to the table rather than falling back on misreading and misinterpretation You are being facetious negative evasive and living up to your username of SqueakBox If you insist on burying this issue on a Guideline proposal page then the issue dies because we dont have enough blackie editors as it is and it will become just a minor discussion between a few Wikipedia editors who probably are not of the group being described and discussed This article will have many African and West Indian readers whereas the Village Pump RFC and other such pages will have very few Look I really need to get back to writing articles for the database for the Enterprise NX01  I have a lot of faith in Nasa and the American peoples desire to explore space So can we leave this discussion as is and accept that Borg assimilation may not desirable but it is a highly practical way of overcoming racism lol
