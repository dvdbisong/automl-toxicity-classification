Claus 

Claus is on all the maps but not mentioned here I remember driving up Claus Road in the 1960s and seeing nothing there It was established in 1896 as were Riverbank and Empire as a railroad stop Since it is on the maps including Google I would like to see at least a stub in Wikipedia It doesnt seem to fit into any of the existing categories here should we start another one called Former Communities or something
