Just a heads up those people asking you to join a forum are not allowed to on Wikipedia Thanks for your contributions however do remember to put row span for only the athletes column not the event column please Secondly if there is not a sentence in the sport your updating on a nation page can you write like a basic sentence like Bermuda has qualified a team of six athletes Thanks TalkContributions
