I would not object to this Go right ahead

 ArbCom elections 

Ciao barts1a I noticed youve made steps towards standing as a candidate in this years ArbCom elections Unfortunately it does not look as if you meet the eligibilty criteria of having made 1000 mainspace edits before November 114 2010 so you will not be able to submit a candidacy please correct me if I am wrong Regards Skomorokh 
I intend to run as this shows I have over 1700 edits more than qualifying me to stand for the position and at any rate this election needs all the candidates it can get   
That link indicates you have 728 mainspace edits not 1000 and some of those 728 have been made since Nov 1st14th Sorry Skomorokh 
Either way I intend to run anyway And if you look at the guideline for edits you will see that it actually says November 14 not November 1   
My mistake it is November 14 as you say However you still do not meet the threshold for article space edits and so are prohibited from running Sincerely Skomorokh 
You seem to have a rather strong position on this   
My error regarding the date aside its pretty black and white Sincerely Skomorokh 
I have withdrawn my selfnomination but I believe that the lack of nominees this time around is due to unfriendly messages such as above I hope that I will have enough edits next time around to qualify   
I apologise if you found my messages unfriendly that was very much not my intention You have the misfortune of being the first ineligible candidate this year so I do not think this can be attributed as the reason for the lack of nominations Best Skomorokh 
CommentBarts1a the requirement is for mainspace edits not total edits You dont appear to meet the requirement  
No wonder candidates are so few and far between   
There are many thousands of wikipedians who easily exceed those requirements and while I dont know if the minimum requirements are the same as last year I suspect that all the successful and most of the unsuccessful candidates in previous years had rather more than a thousand mainspace edits Any explanation for the paucity of candidates would need to explain why fewer of the qualified candidates are standing SpielChequers 
Too much paperwork Mostly one editors fault and a week filled with people saying nasty things about you  For most of us RfA was enough and I leaned my lesson last year  

Barts1a Im not sure why youve requested comment on this It is a black and white standard I dont know the reason behind it but I would guess it is to ensure that only Wikipedia contributors that have a certain level of experience and dedication to the project are allowed to run in the ArbCom elections Of course counting
