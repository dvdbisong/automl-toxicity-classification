CONCEPT 5
I have added a prod template to the article CONCEPT 5 suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process All contributions are appreciated but I dont believe it satisfies Wikipedias criteria for inclusion and Ive explained why in the deletion notice see also What Wikipedia is not and Wikipedias deletion policy Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia or if you disagree with the notice discuss the issues at its talk page Removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process but the article may still be sent to Articles for Deletion where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached or if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria
