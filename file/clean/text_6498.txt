Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOSJP talk page a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin such as Fainaru FantajÄ« in  for the sake of simplicity I called this case words of English origin more information on semantics here

Over the course of a month it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side Therefore a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties One suggestion on a compromise has been given already but it has not found unanimous agreement so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested

One universally accepted point was to bring more users from the affected projects in to help achieve consensus and you were one of those selected in the process

What this invitation is
 You should give feedback on the first suggested compromise and are highly encouraged to provide other solutions
What this invitation is not
 This is not a vote on including or excluding such romanizations
 This is not a vote on compromises either

It would be highly appreciated if you came over to the MOSJP talk page and helped find a solution Thank you in advance
