I gladly admit that this is a weak spot for me and I dont handle it well Hey in my dreams Im still naked trying to run away and I cant remember how to even walk   
I guess we all have bad dreams My recurring nightmare is turning up for my Alevel exams  the ones we have to take here to get into university  knowing absolutely nothing about the subjects And then having to go back and spend another three years in school which just doesnt happen here I even wake up in a sweat sometimes wondering whether I actually passed or not  Corbett 03
