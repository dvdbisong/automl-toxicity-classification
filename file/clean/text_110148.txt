This part is now totally rewritten to make the importance of this part clear the reasons for the establishment of the WGKF I did mention the GKIF with an internal link since this is the Wikipedia way even though I dont agree with what is written in that article Just for the record my hands are itching to change the misinformation and lies in that article as well but I wont since it would only start another edit war I believe it is a good thing to have their story on GKIF and our story here on WGKF If each side would stay away from the other side the edit war would finally be over Now there is the problem we are willing to stay away from GKIF but people from GKIF are not willing to stay away from WGKF So WHO is keeping the edit war alive here
