Fair use rationale for ImageCriterionplace1jpg

ImageCriterionplace1jpg is being used on this article I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use In addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale Using one of the templates at WikipediaFair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page

If there is  other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May 2006 and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page Thank you
