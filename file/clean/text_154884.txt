On your first point youd be veering into original research by adding qualifiers from sources that do not mention this study or come from it and the study did not say it was rape you did  That written lets see what you have in mind as a qualifer including the source Ill add that when you look at other categories of assault like touching nearly twice the reported rate vs penetration the not serious enough reason goes up to 75  On your second point the section is not just the AAU study but recent campus surveys  So Kentucky presents another study at a college with a better sample size at that  If you want to make it easier to compare then you can add the combined MaleFemale assault rates to the AAU study section
