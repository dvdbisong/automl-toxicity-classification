Hello I uploaded the license of Arnold Murray to wikipedia and updated the links However I am not sure I did the copyright correctly The copyright categories seem rather odd The license as noted is from the Benton County AR Clerks Office and no copyright applies it is public record Can you check it and make sure it is correct  Thanks
