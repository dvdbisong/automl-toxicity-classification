I am not sure if you are really understanding what I have been saying We cannot put our own views or views of a leader of any party or even base the partys ideology on them I have been requesting you to read their manifestos from the very beginning Any party will not run on a single leaders views or any newspaper views If you find the CPNM and CPNUML identically same or if you find one partys inclination towards socialism andor hardliner communism in simple words their political ideology and ultimately their position on the spectrum same as the other in their manifestos please let us all know I will immediately withdraw my points Let us not debate here any single person who has read both manifestos would be crystal clear on the UCPNM and CPNUML as far as what their position is Do not trust me but at least please go through their manifestos
Also I have been watching many parties wiki pages of several countries across continents and all of them have their position stated Why do you want to not keep it here Ithink it makes it more clear with their position on  the spectrum Thanks3811481204
