SVG on Commons
The only problem The software I use doesnt utilize or recognize SVG And I have no idea how to translate or any software freeware that is available So if someone would point me in the right direction and give me a few pointers about how to do SVG well maybe then The idea of cleanup however is insulting  as it suggests something wrong with the image
