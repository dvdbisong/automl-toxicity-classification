Ive read your reply to Vartans talkpage I dont think there need be any more evidences that Ankaram Laciner and Falcon are all the same user The one disapear and one reapear just after is just more than a coincidences that each add links to his journal is more than just coincidences that each have contributions covered in his journal is just more than coincidences That Falcon has the same prejudicial beliefs as Laciner is also not a coincidences at all If you are attempting to show us that there is nothing surprising that three different users contribute in the same articles where nearly no one else has contributed and that they all registered just after the other has left than I think it is failed Probabilisticly when adding all the elements there can be no rational doubt that they are all the same person Quebec Science is also something I read which is more notable but it doesnt have any entry in Wikipedia neither has its president or what have you his page and Im sure he does give lectures around the world too  ix
