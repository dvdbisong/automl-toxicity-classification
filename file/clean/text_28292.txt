Hi I appreciate your current efforts to add to the Tony Hendra article Those efforts will be more successful if you do the following

 Review the following policy pages WikipediaAutobiography and WikipediaNeutral_point_of_view
 Explain the changes youre making in a brief form in the Edit Summary box you see in the edit form just above the Save Page button or in more detail on the TalkTony_Hendra page

The approach youve taken so far adding lots of information to the top of the article then lots of blank space to force the original content way down the page is problematic because it represents an apparent effort to hide some of the information on the page Wikipedia doesnt normally work that way

Assuming you actually are Tony Hendra I can understand your concerns with some of the current material in the article The best way to move the Tony Hendra article in the direction you appear to want to move it would be to discuss the problems you have with the article on the TalkTony_Hendra page For myself Id be happy to use some of the information youve been adding to flesh out the noncontroversial parts of the article though I would probably want to dehype it a little to satisfy the WikipediaNeutral_point_of_view policy

The material on the controversy with Jessica Hendra is more problematic That controversy exists and a case could be made that for good or ill it has come to be a significant part of your public notability To the extent thats true removing it from the article would be contrary to the interests of Wikipedias readers who expect to find relevant biographical information in a biographical article

You might very well see the matter differently and if so you have every right to express that point of view and to work with other editors to try to improve the article To the extent we can arrive at some sort of an editorial consensus though it will help that improvement process work more smoothly Discussing your concerns on the TalkTony_Hendra page would be a good way to work toward such a conensus

Thanks
