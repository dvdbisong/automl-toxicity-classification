Simply before I read the rules Ive tried to make contructive edits since Ive corrected some articles and started one although I realised there is an article for that company it does not predate 1997 and the company is actually from the 1930s so Ive kept it because the name has changed since Im not really into the whole vandalism its kind of pointless but yes before it was inexcusable but this certainly wasnt me and I have no idea what any of that computer lingo meant so I cant really respond If required I will create a new account its just I lose credit for my contributions thats all
