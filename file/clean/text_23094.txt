Saying Serbs made two thirds of the population before the Balkan wars is irrational and do not correspondent at all with different statistical data from that time Even Serbian historians say Albanians had majority many centuries before these wars I still believe and will continue to so Saying hundred thousands were killed and hundred thousands fled is propaganda I hope Serbs are not saying something like this to justify the crimes and ethnic cleansing committed by them in the 90s
