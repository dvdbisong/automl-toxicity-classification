You are entirely correct AR Rahman is indeed an Oscar winner my research was sloppy Please dont be offended this is intended as friendly goodnatured humor but I couldnt help chuckling about how many refs you added to back up your point Since I willingly concede that you are correct perhaps we might agree to reduce the number of refs on that sentence they arent really all necessary Understand that I was not attempting to slight the gentlemen thus I added the quote from Time magazine to highlight his importance and recognition Ive noticed your work on other sections of the article and look forward to cooperating with you to improve it Thanks for your time  Tropics
