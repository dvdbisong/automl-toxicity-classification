Thanks for the understanding The main difficulty I have is that I dont think that the approach favoured by the Wikipedian powersthatbe is the most helpful for any of us Given a blank sheet of paper I would have a main article concentrating upon the Stratfordian argument and why the proponents of most alternative candidates not most antiStrats reject them Each alternative candidate could then have a very brief mention in the main article mainly historical and one spinoff article discussing the case for it along the lines of the Marlovian one In other words if you want to get there I dont think you should be starting from here Peter Farey 821198197
