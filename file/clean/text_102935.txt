On httpwwwmeanspeedcom under the side bar Graphs there are sets of examples Under BPM List there are over 10000 examples of the precise speeds of popular music pieces from every genre  Under Charts there are 144 visual examples in histogram form
Moreover on the sidebar if you choose Blog the archived materialseasily navigableyield over 1000 examples  Methodology is included in detail for testing yourself which is most encouraged

Keep in mind I am aware that the navigation system on meanspeedcom is not the bestso I hired the besta webmaster from Seattle who began work on a much friendlier easy to navigate and understand sitea project he begun on Thanksgiving and will be up in a month  The meanspeedcom that appears now is a considerable improvement over the original August 2004 version as many have noted  What I am calling Meanspeed 20 will be that much better

And OF COURSE love to hook up with iTunes  So said the site is well documented I have letters from Dr Manfred Clynes calling what a did a GOLD MINE OF DATA  I want others to use it to control speed when they want  Id like to get credit for the discovery  So said it is a pattern in natureI did not invent it did not make a gadget out of itit simply is  I long for the day when people see that the theory is as try as water is wet or the sun rises in the east

Again thank you for your consideration and please send any suggestions to meanspeedgmailcom

Sincerely
Ian Andrew Schneider
