Yeah the no sex is a problem whole load or problems on poor old Reggie though if you ask me seems to be massive arguments and angry editing  Thank Goodness it never gets like that over here I shall withold my vote to see what happens next  I started Architecture of the United Kingdom as you saw full of entheusiasm because Graham started it as a red link but Ive rather lost my way and interest think Ill go back to proper Italian buildings for a while trouble is people who have all been on their summer holidays to Italia always know best because their badly translated cheap guide books have muddled things up I think Ill call myself Gary the Guide and they might beleive me then  Perhaps Ill go on the Italian Wiki instead but they are all so young over there my son and his friends included  Had the anticipated bad day at work yesterday and this morning which is a sod Im going to stop being an Anglophile that will serve them right  Take care  1649 23 Nov 2004 UTC
