 Editing survey 

Hi SandyGeorgia My name is Mike Lyons and I am a doctoral student at Indiana University I am conducting research on the writing and editing of high traffic current events articles on Wikipedia I have noticed in the talk page archives at Barack Obama that you have contributed to the editing or maintenance of the article I was hoping you would agree to fill out a brief survey about your experience This study aims to help expand our thinking about collaborative knowledge production Believe me I share your likely disdain for surveys but your participation would be immensely helpful in making the study a success A link to the survey is included below
