Note that editor    is hardly an unbiased editor on this case His extremely biased and onesided point of view on the SRA topic is obvious 

from the SRA talk page
We are required to report on topics to the extent and with a tone equivalent to the mainstream view of the topic discussed Any emphasis on the credibility or reality of SRA is out of keeping with the majority belief that SRA is a discredited if not embarassing part of the 8090s This has been discussed to death in the archives If you do not agree with our policy on a neutral point of view you are welcome to contribute to another online venue elsewhere You may be well served by reviewing this administrators noticeboard  SRA is not a topic of mainstream interest and the page should not place any emphasis on source and text that gives the impression that SRA is perceived as anything except a moral panic WLU t c rules  simple rules 

This point of  view ignores a large portion of the research and promotes the views of a few extremists

strong POV counter to mine as shown above This is a clear conflict of interest
