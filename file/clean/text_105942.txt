In your future dealings with editors on articles please be aware of the above policy that says you should discuss any changes after your bold change has been reverted on the article talk page In other words 
 You being bold which is great
 Me Reverting because unless they are resurrected by magic zombies are not paranormal creatures in the traditional sense 
 You should of Discussed

Please bear this in mind in future This is so that you can fully justify your reasoning behind the changes and are not caught up in pointless edit wars going back and forth and then you yourself cannot be accused of edit warring Look forward to working with you     

 I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times then be discussed And I have seen several main editors who Im sure you would know if named who dodnt follow BRD at all
 And I wasnt going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it If you werent happy with that then I would have discussed it
 But as you seem happy with it now as you havent reverted it then there isnt any problem   

Just because they dont doesnt mean you shouldnt Old saying do as I say not as I do comes to mind In other words do as Wikipedia says not as other editors do and you cant really go wrong 
Its not a case of being happy with it I just dont want to edit war over it I do not believe that it is classed as paranormal the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genres listed in the opening lead     

 The idea of free will also comes to mind Like I said if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page Im not going to waste my time I added an edit in and then later found a source for it Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source As we are using our own opinions on the page you dont believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres l well I personally think fantasy could go The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet   
Good idea Ill get rid of it A source isnt usually needed for every genre I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page Just so other involved can par take     
 Woops just realised I moved this over to my archive Meant to only move the two dormant posts   
Thats cool I thought it was something like that so I replaced it     

Thor
Yes I saw the film almost two weeks ago The walkandtalk corridor scene where Loki shapeshifts several times But we all need to cite our sources and they cant be personal viewing until after the film comes out You did cite it the second time so alls well
