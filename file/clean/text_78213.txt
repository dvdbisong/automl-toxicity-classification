Redundancy depends on your view of infoboxes My view is that everything they say should be in the text so that it can be sourced and qualified if necessary Two examples here Brunswick was not a belligerent it hired troops to the King of Great Britain it should also be stated that the Indians of New England fought on the American side although the present text allows for it That this did them little good is offtopic here  PMAnderson
