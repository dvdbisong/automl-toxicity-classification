Interesting that you readily accept sources which show plagiarism and conjecture as adequate for wikipedia such as the stated references and readily reject legal documentary reliable invention proposal evidence that even shows the intended patent classifications both international patent classification and USA paten classification  My question then is what is wikipedias standard for what is a verifiable reliable source  Thus far plagiarism and conjecture sources seem to be the acceptable sources  Something wrong with that
