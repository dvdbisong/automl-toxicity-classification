Of course its incoherent but thats probably more a problem of your remedial reading comprehension abilities than it is a problem of my writing abilities Anybody with half a brain would be able to figure out what Im trying to say my response to rd232 is that he himself undermines the legitimacy of his actions of deleting my additions of criticisms of CounterPunch on its Wikipedia page when he points out its feasible to cover the relevant controversies in a neutral and balanced manner written as part of the History section and avoiding unnecessary direct quotation of political opponents smear phrases which means that not only are changes not deletion of the criticisms doable but also that the quotes of criticism about CounterPunch need to exist in the first place if you want to make the quotes as balanced as possible which again cant be done if Rd232 is deleting any criticism of CounterPunch in the first place 
But again like I said chances are you probably wont understand what Im saying because my writing abilities are above and beyond your level of reading comprehension so its unlikely youre response will comprise of anything more than ad hominems rather than addressing the content of my comment
