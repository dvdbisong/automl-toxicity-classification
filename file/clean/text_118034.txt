So then you agree that TNOTR is a real thing And real things should not be categorized as fictional things If there were an article on the fictional abbey then it would properly be categorized as a fictional library and an article on Blind Jorge would belong in the fictional librarians category Do you understand the mess that would result if real things were categorized on the basis of all of the fictional things withiin them The typical book or film article could potentially be in dozens of fictional foos categories which would swamp the categories for what the book or film actually is and would render the fictional items categories useless It is absolutely correct to include the library and librarian on the appropriate lists It is dead wrong to place them in the categories
