Why isnt there anything or any link to the story about him and that woman in Toronto   
A vandal deleted the reference and no one caught it It has since been readded under the personal life section  
Im back now and it looks like someone deleted that section again  

I wont get into the existence of a Criticism section its been discussed before and if its consensus to keep it Im all for it But it does seem to be piling it on when the Bronson Arroyo glove slapping incident is mentioned in two separate sections It appears under criticisms and under the 2004 section when it happened Under the criticism section its even referred to as blatant And while I think it actually was pretty blatant it seems like POV to use such a strong word The Schilling quote following it sums up the feeling enough I think including such an obviously subjective word on top of it actually detracts from the critical nature of the paragraph and makes it seem more like Arod haters wrote it than an objective encyclopedia The evidence is damning enough  I wont change it yet but anyone have any thoughts  
Agreed and changed  

 2001  2002 HRs 
It says his 109 HRs in 20012002 are most ever for consecutive AL seasons I believe The Babe hit 113 between 1920  1921 Not sure thoughThe preceding unsigned comment was added by  talk  contribs

The Bambino also hit 114 in 192627 60 and 54
It says righthanded in the article the Bambino was lefthanded  

Cleanup
Regarding Greiners reverts 1 it was proper to include the second comma in a series for example A B and C and his revision is therefore inappropriate 2 it is proper to have the year series read 198890 as I had it and therefore his revision is not appropriate and 3 while it is the general rule to write out numbers one through nine here  in baseball articles and in articles that also have the same numbers in a series represented by numberals as in hit 9 home runs and ten home runs in consecutive years it is acceptable to have numbers 19 written out  It especially aids the reader in articles such as this one which are replete with numbers in that numerals are easier to scan

 Middle Name 

His middle name isnt Enmanuel its Emmanuel httpwwwgooglecomsearchsourceidnavclientaqtieUTF8rlz1T4HPID_en___US218qalexemmanuelrodriguez  

I think Alex is the best player in the world I like he has the same middle name My mom says it means Jesus I think that mean maybe Alex is related to Jesus like Jesus is his great grandfather Thats why he is the best player in the world I think he will beat Barry in the end
