The point Luna is the repulsion I feel in reading the racial  religiously vilifying views of a bigot such as Sumple views which are selfconfessed and unretracted Note that these views are much more recent than 10 years ago that was a lie by Sumple which you fell for In fact it doesnt take a moment to figure out that as they are on Sumples personal pages linked from Wikipedia can you believe it that they are his current views He could log in to geocities and remove those pages in about five minutes if he wanted to
I gave Sumple fair opportunity to renounce his odious writings  something he chose not to do Obviously he doesnt wish to retract his offensive opinions
Having seen that Luna it should be clear to you as to why it is critical that other Wikipedians be given fair warning about the sort of influences that might be present whenever Sumple begins to edit articles in a neutral and encyclopedic medium such as Wikipedia Remember that Im not just warning the Wikipedian community of something petty or minor say Sumples problems with grammar Sumples views are subject to the Racial Vilification Act 1996 NSW and I would hate to see articles in Wikipedia brought into disrepute on that basis All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing
