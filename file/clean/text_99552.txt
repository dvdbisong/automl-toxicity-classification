An admin said to drop the matter and I didI stopped making comments on ANI  However I did make closing remarks to that admins user talk page  In retaliation I am being punished  Polite closing remarks on the admins talk page should not be a blockable offence  With this said any further blocking is punishment which is illegal  If unblocked I wont make further comments  So unblock is reasonable
