you are correct the map says it shows Turkic peoples but it barely shows turkic speakers considering the genetic profile of anatolian turks The most reliable estimates suggest roughly 30 Central Asian admixture for both mitochondrial and Ychromosome loci in AnatoliaTurkey That admittedly approximate figure is compatible both with a substantial immigration accompanying the arrival of the Turkmen armies which is not historically documented and with continuous gene flow from Asia into Anatolia at a rate of 1 for 40 generations 2 httpenwikipediaorgwikiOghuz_Turks 
i think its not rightful for Turkish people some turkish people claim Anatolian blood and others Turkic its their blood and they are to decide what they want to be called but roughly 30 Central Asian admixture says a lot about the fake 100 yellow Turkey Turkic peoples map
