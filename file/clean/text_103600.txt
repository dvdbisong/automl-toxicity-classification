Bias and Errors 

This articles makes it appear that the shalwar qamiz is mainly a womens dress It gives two paragraphs on how women wear the shalwar qamiz but only mentions in passing that men wear it also
In Bangladesh India and Pakistan one simply visits the local tailor and has a salwar suit made to order This is not completely true as many people buy ready made shalwar qamiz This once again shows bias as its mostly women that go to the tailor and have it made while men just purchase it in the store
Afghanistan  even if you disagreed with the spelling why did you remove that it is the national dress of Afghanistan
As for spelling does anyone disagree with the fact that the Central AsiansTurkmen Kazakhs Uzbeks Kyrgyz called it shalwar It doesnt matter that salwar gets more google hits More people call pashtuns pathans but that doesnt really mean anything Putting it as Shalwar Kameez is a comprimise between the correct spelling shalwar qamiz and salwar kameez
