I think that to be fair to him you should have someone else take his request to be unblocked  I am not saying that you can not be neutral and fair but as you are the one who has taken on all of his requests and were the original admin to block him so I would appretiate if you gave a fresh mind this duty  I am by no means saying that he should be unblocked but I read the section on the admins notice board and feel that the same few people are participating in the discussion Thanks
