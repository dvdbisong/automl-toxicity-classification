Things Ive learned at enwikipedia
 When I made a change and I want that the edition appears I am a user disruptive because I dont respect the previous edition When I defend the previous edition the concept previous edition means nothing Or the dates are ignored and Im the disruptive again The two solutions are good

 Although it is not written anywhere exist a rule that says that any offense expires in a few days If you can not give notice of the offense because you were blocked ill or without computer for a mechanical failure bad luck for you Here solutions not justice And that Pope Time erases the sins is a good solution

 Open spaces for dialogue and discussion and pledge to respect the result is not a sign of wanting to do things right

 Apparently appreciate the intention of a user is not feasible but ignore two serious violations of the rules is perfectly acceptable

 Administrators tend to be more ruthless with solitary users than with organized groups

 If a user with a clean record discuss with another user with a nonclean record the administrator only monitor and punish the user with dirty record The other user will not have problems

Enjoy your toy friendly and honest gentlemen
