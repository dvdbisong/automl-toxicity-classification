Dogmatically hostile Gimme a break Why do you hate Christians This article is hardly NPOV and it needs balance I will restore it Isnt this poisoning the well by removing it CBerlet is not a theologian and isnt competant to discuss theological matters
Im hostile to what I see as an effort to paint all Christians with a broad brush and impose partisanship Its funny that I get accused of NPOV violations on this when I simply point out that Dominionism is controversial among Evangelicals
