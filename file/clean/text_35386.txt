Reference to Caduceus in Homer Odyssey V 4748

William K Emerson Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms University of Oklahoma Press 1996 pp 181182

The Medical Department adopted a 1inchhigh gilt caduceus  as its insignia in 1902 For the service uniform officers wore the device in bronze  The caduceus two serpents intertwined on a winged staff was carried by Mercury the god of commerce Shortly after the surgeon general announced the caduceus as the medical symbol critics said it was not appropriate even though the caduceus had been used intermittently as various US Army insignia starting with the chevrons for hospital stewards in 1851 The debate was important because it was apparent to all of the officers that the insignia was to become the device for the expanding Medical Department The critics were unhappy with the caduceus as the medical insignia and they stated that the single serpent looped about a staff was properly associated with Aesculapius the Greek god of healing

Some are outraged that the caduceus as a symbol of commerce and even worse should be associated with medicine Hermes was also a god of dishonest eloquence and thievery Others suggest that Hermes caduceus may today be as appropriate an emblem for medicine as the staff of Asclepius After all the important business of medicine grows ever more complex with advertising essential for competitive marketing So one medical doctor Glenn W Geelhoed poses the dilemma Each of us physicians may choose what the profession should mean and between two serpent symbols representing very competitive ideals adopt a symbol that is appropriate to Cant get page number or rest of quote through Google page number also needed
