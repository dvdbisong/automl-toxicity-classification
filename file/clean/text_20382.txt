Basically that sounds fine except for some changes I propose
1 2nd sentence add a record for the longest continuous sea voyage without resupply or landing at a port
2 3rd sentence change to Upon landing at Pier 81 in Manhattan he was met by family and friends by his girlfriend Soanya Ahmad and their infant son and by the press
I am not sure if greet is the right word here especially since the infant son probably just stared at him
3 Since the NY Times reference you give was written the day before the landing I would suggest two additional references written after the arrival one from aolcom News and the other from the Associated Press hosted by googlecom
a NYC man returns from 3year sea voyage
b Man Credits Love in Record 3Year Trip at Sea
I agree with placing the text at the end of the intro with the full text as follows
On June 17 2010 Reid Stowe sailed the schooner Anne up the Hudson river and docked in New York The total voyage time was 1152 days a record for the longest continuous sea voyage without resupply or landing at a port Upon landing at Pier 81 in Manhattan he was met by family and friends by his girlfriend Soanya Ahmad and their infant son and by the pressNYC man returns from 3year sea voyageMan Credits Love in Record 3Year Trip at SeaA RecordSmashing Sea Journey and Not for Its Speed
How is that
