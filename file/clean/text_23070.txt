I suppose what is relevant is the day the Declaration was supposed to come into effect  Most legislation contains a date at which it becomes effective which may be months away from when it is passed  Britains other former colonies for example often celebrate independence days on the anniversary of the date their countries became independent rather than when the legislation was passed  The US is a bit different because it declared independence unilaterally
