360Elite 

Whatever you do dont get the core system  The core has wired controllers no HDD and composite output  The Premium has wireless controller a 20 gig HDD and compositecomponent outputs  The Elite has wireless controllers a 120 gig HDD and HDMIcompositecomponent outputs  You should get the Elite if you plan to use XBL alot for downloads demos are about a gig usually or if you want true 1080p  Though honestly you can survive with the 20 gigs and I use component and digital output for a good picture and sound quality Talk
