Under the heading Overlordship outside his kingdoms in the caption for the map showing Cnut the Greats domains allied states are said to be coloured in  I see this as a rather sickly shade of  I note that this colour is also given as yellow in the descriptions for both the WP png file and its original on Wikimedia Commons Id change the caption and descriptions myself but dont want to get shouted at And while Im about it the descriptions for both image files point to Canute the Great which of course is now a redirect and presumably ought to be changed
