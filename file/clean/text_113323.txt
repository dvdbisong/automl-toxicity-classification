He alluded to me as being a fool said I dont understand plain English and then mocked me on his talk page getting me blocked He was indisputably an involved editor when he asked you to take action against me That in itself shouldve disqualified you from giving me an immediate block And the saddest part is that after all of his disregard for the issue at hand  the insertion of inappropriate content  he finally acknowleged in the ANI that I am probably correct Too bad as you are probably right on the content issue Had he said that in the first place we could have productively pursued resolution of this issue But he needed to say it to the editor making the inappropriate edits not me 7618912157
