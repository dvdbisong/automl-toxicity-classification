That is a matter of opinion but with 4 blatantly wrong CSD tags out of 17  nearly a 25 fail rate  youre not even in the game let alone the ballpark You are wielding CSD as a blunt instrument tagging first and thinking about it later It needs to be used much more as a surgical instrument Furthermore although you removed CSD tags in two cases even after being told about here on this page you have not gone back to the user talk pages and apologized andor removed the CSD tags No we arent discussing an attempt at perfection here we are discussing competence and civility You make a big point out of demanding civility from others posting on your talk page but what you dont understand is that what you are doing is a pretty serious form of incivility In addition to the CSD taggings you are picking new articles and adding all sorts of problem tags to them instead of actually building content Again I ask you  instead of tagging articles how about adding content to them An example of a newly created article I did that with Django Walker was listed at DYK When I first saw it it was nominated for CSD We are here to build an encyclopedia Are you    talk
