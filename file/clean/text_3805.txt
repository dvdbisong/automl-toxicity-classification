Dodger  And a merry whatever it is you celebrate too   To sign your name you just need to type three tildas  and to sign and date put four tildas   In the edit box this will just look like tildas but when you save the page the software automatically converts it for you  If you have java enabled on your browser you will see a signature looking button at the top of the edit box it is the second from the right if you click this it will automatically put four tildas for you  If you want to change how your signature appears you can go to my preferences which is at the top right of the webpage  There you can alter your signature  Ive done this which is why my signature looks a little different from others  Does this help  Again welcomebest kevin talk
