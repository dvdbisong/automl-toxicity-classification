Okay lets meet halfway on this I propose that the section be entered as the following

In August of 2008 Kates made headlines when the under wire of her bra set off metal detectors in Oakland International Airport Airport security required her to remove her bra in an airport bathroom in order to clear security due to the fact that large under wire bras contain more metal than an average bra As a result Kates has stated that she plans to consult with an attorney as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women

This way the size of her breasts is not directly mentioned but the underlying cause for the incident is revealed to the reader

And with all due respect to Ms Kates just because something that some may find embarassing happens in a public forumn does not invalidate its worth in an article about said person
