Haitham Al Haddad 

Sir
 
I wish to report again that several users are attempting to block me from editing this page I have done nothing wrong all I am doing is reverting the article to how it was originally They want to input negative assertions about this person which amount to nothing other than personal attacks Yet when I try to undo their changes it seems they are ganging up on me by making threats against me They want to ban me permanantely and prevent me from having my say I feel victimised harassed and bullied and am getting upset about it

I have never warred and I am not a vandal Yet these are other users are trying to discredit me and it is not fair In fact these users are warring and vandalising and they are allowed to get away with it I do hope am not being discriminated against
 
I am doing this because Mr Haddad is someone I know as he is the Imam at my local mosque He also has young children and if they see what has been written about him it would cause this a great deal of distress
 
I have tried to mediate with the user Blixx but heshe has ignored me and has continued regardless
 
Please assist me with this issue
