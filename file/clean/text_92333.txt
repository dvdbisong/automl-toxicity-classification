Assyrian propaganda on Wikipedia 
Is this the way how you handle problems on Wikipedia by simply closing the case without finding a compromise What happens if I put Aramean continuity related topics to the Assyrian people article and everything will be deleted or distorted by Assyrian fascists again because they think they are the owner of this article They even have a WikiProject called Assyria and dont care about neutrality and support Assyrianism We are fed up that all our contributions on Wikpedia even with references are getting removed  without a valid reason Are you there to check it and undo it This is why I was in favour for a neutral common page called AssyrianSyriac people Syriac people or whatever focused only on our Christian heritage where we all agree on Whats wrong with the idea to create articles within a common page to express each groups views The current Assyrian people article mixed up with Assyrian plus Aramean topics would led to edit wars again
