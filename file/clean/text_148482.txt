Hi Padma and Nat
Padma I can understand your desire and frankly I see that there is precedence for it  At a prior instantiation of this dab page here there was in fact a header In Buddhism I also agree with Nat insomuch that I think there is merit in only making changes to articles when merited and I guess Nat is focusing us again on the merit of the insertedrevertedinsertedrevertedinserted text  I apologize then for my perhaps putting the cart before the horse
I think the inserted text contains two significantly different types of information so Id like to explore their merits independently  Im gonna create two subheaders below to facilitate this  talk 

 Bath Batha Tabaath 
The first insertedreverted sentence reads
In Islam the Arabic text Bath Batha and Tabaath is found in the Quran 622 Sura AlJumua The Quran Sura 622 httpwwwsacredtextscomislquran06201htm and is believed to be refering to BuddhaMaulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg1007

The hidden references are
 The Quran Sura 622
 httpwwwsacredtextscomislquran06201htm
 Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg1007

So it appears to me that the reason that this sentence is pertinent to the word Buddha is because it identifies a possible referent in the Quran to the Buddha or a buddha  Since this article is about definitions of the word Buddha per se  and not about the historicalmythic Buddha or other buddhas  it seems to me that this sentence is inappropriate for this article  It should go in the appropriate article eg possibly Gautama Buddha or Buddhahood  Right  Does this make sense  This dab page is about the word Buddha and contains pointers to articles that then provide meanings to this word  The above sentence alludes to the meaning of Buddha as Gautama Buddha or again perhaps Buddhahood still not clear to me from the sentence    Perhaps in terms of semantic cohesion it would best fit in Gautama Buddha in world religions  What do yall think   talk 

 Buddha Arabic 
The second insertedreverted sentence reads
The origin of the word Buddha in Arabic is of descent or he roused him and put into action Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

The hidden reference is
4 Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

Here this sentence does in fact provide a new instance of the word Buddha separate from the existing denotations of Gautama Buddha Buddhahood Buddharupa etc  I think the next question becomes whether or not every instantiation of this word is worthy of an entry on this WP dab page  For example I previously mentioned one prior suggestion that an entry be identified as a noteworthy instance of the word in another reliable source such as the Encyclopedia Britannica the Columbia Encyclopedia dictionaries from Oxford University Press etc  Nat mentioned the matter of each entry on this dab page being associated with an individual WP article eg Buddha Records Buddha Air etc  This sentence appears to fail to meet either of these suggested standards  Perhaps if not worthy of an entry in the WP encyclopedia might it be worth an entry in the Wiktionary here  Does the need for encyclopedic significance make sense  Thanks for your continued civil discourse  talk
