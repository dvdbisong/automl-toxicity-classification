There is nothing a priori that prevents an admin from watching a contentious article that is already under enforcement and stepping in when needed  I probably did this a few times myself  You can have situations where the participants dont realize how toxic behavior is to others who might want to contribute or indeed they might enjoy the toxic environment  That said if there is a concern that an admin is being too heavyhanded it seems like the place to bring it up first is WPAE so it can be reviewed by other admins who have experience in enforcement matters Thatcher
