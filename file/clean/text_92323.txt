Forbes List 

I have finally got around to reading the talk page Though I believe the inclusion of a Forbes reference in the heading of a wiki page detracts from the credibility of wiki due to the subjective nature of the source I will relent in my pursuit of improving wiki content by moving or removing Forbes material for Dilma Rousseff and Sonia Gandhi

It is interesting to note that the most powerful man in the USA Obama does not have a Forbes ranking on his page Neither does Dmitry Medvedev Shimon Peres David Cameron Stephen Harper Julia Gillard Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski Jalal Talabani or dozens of other world leaders How about some consistency B Fairbairn talk
