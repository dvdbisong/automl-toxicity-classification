STARBLIND and HYPERINDIVIDUALIST YAHOOCOM ARE PART OF THE HOAX

A geneologist expert has been brought in to verify the previous article Several of the points have already been proven with verifiable facts and evidence Yet when those point are made evidently clear both starbling and HyperindividualistYahoocom continue to ignore it and chose not to respond The true hoax on this Barbaro family page is that these two individuals are trying to ignore verifiable evidence and have set out to destroy good knowledge for everyone verifiable knowledge Starblind has decided to put what ever he wants on the page but can not provide a single source of evidence to validate his selection These two hoaxers have only one desire but to detroy good validated information for the public and to extend turmoil These two hoaxers continually make attempts to stop progress and provide no real solutions for Wikipedia problems  I suggest that Starblind be removed from Wikipedia editing He is a trouble maker of the highest category and ignores reason
