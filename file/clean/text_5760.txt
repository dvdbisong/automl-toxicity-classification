A considerable number of Israeli citizens who were born in the former SU are ethnic Russians  i doubt it considerably i think that out of the 100K russian citizens in israel those are the people who immigrated after 1997 there are about 50 NONjews as the israel statistics show and so the number 50K might be very accurate others out of the 300K non jews in israel mostly are ukrainians  oohh really who gives a damn
