ProGay Bias 
To be honest I am not sure I entirely follow What is exactly is meant by holding a progay bias That I am in favour of homosexuality This seems entirely nonsensical and indeed strictly speaking to be progay would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to To be quite honest I think the whole notion of a progay bias is entirely homophobic and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality Clearly the article has a distinctly homophobic bias It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant homosexuality as a postindustrial cosmopolitan lifestyle and homosexuality as the social norm These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations ie the majority of society in the West and specifically progressives and social liberals Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships Stating the views of socialconservatives as objective facts without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly increased  as a result of the  modern urbanity of the postindustrial age when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of peoples sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century On these grounds I intend to revert this article  1000 9 Jun 2004 UTC
