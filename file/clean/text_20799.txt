See thats always the way Id considered it too although Im a Catholic who supports Liverpool However the debate still rages fiercely  I used to work at Radio Merseyside on the Roger Phillips phonein and it would crop up all the time As soon as one person said on the phone that Everton were always the Catholic club youd get twenty people phoning in to say they were the Protestant club Its such a fervent debate that theres really just not the space it needs on the Wikipedia entry and surely the fact that theres even a debate shows that the religious affiliations of the two clubs arent as ingrained in their existence as those of Rangers and Celtic  as such I dont think its necessary to include it  1447
