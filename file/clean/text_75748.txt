Hello there My name is Eric AKA MouthlessBobcat I recently created Francesca Hogian article It is properly sourced gives good references and is suitable under WPBIO Yet it survived two deletion nominations For some reason I think the subject being a television personality the audience doesnt feel the subject is notable but that isnt the case

They all decided to Merge the article and that made me very upset as they did not even consider my opinion I really need your help because I feel this article is suitable and I dont want it hidden or brushed away
