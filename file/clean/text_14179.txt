This can no longer be considered a good article 

Recent damaging changes by NorthBySouthBaranof should either be removed or remove this article from the featured section
Problems include sources that are lying And a complete lack of care for the neutral point of view you guys always go on about Specifically in terms of the Gamergate section
North should face sanctions and this article should be fixed Thanks 711927222
