Never find it 

Never find it  Carlotta California  vandal moved it Verse  

Will The above is the Requested moves template but since they look like they have a three day backlog for the uncontroversial moves section Ive copied it over to your page as well I could probably do the same thing the vandal did moved the page to a new page and then move again but thats such a messy solution 

 needs to be spanked banned and the Never find it page should probably be prememptively salted and the middle page Carlotta Lucas wennerholm needs to be deleted TIA 

I would have never even found out about this page move except that userWP 10 bot ran without the Bot flag set and so I looked at WikipediaVersion 10 Editorial TeamCalifornia articles by quality log which not only shows changes in article assessments using the  template but shows page moves as well I wonder how many other sneaky page moves have been done that nobody has caught Verse
