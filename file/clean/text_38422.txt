The issue is not who it targets but rather the fact that it invokes people with mental disabilities in an offensive unkind derisive belittling and meanspirited way as its vehicle for doing so  It is distinguished from the redirects you refer by the note of ridicule which is what makes it objectionable  I directed your attention earlier to WPUSERPAGEInappropriate_content  Please note that in accordance with this content guideline extremely offensive material may be removed on sight by any editor  I have elected not to do so but another editor may come along and remove it and be well within his or her rights to do so without asking politely as I do now for the third time for you to remove it yourself

Please be aware however that while polite requests are the preferred way of resolving problems with inappropriate userpage content there are other avenues for doing so as WPUSERPAGERemoval_of_inappropriate_content states user subpages with inappropriate content may be deleted through the WPMfD process in accordance with Wikipedias deletion policy talk
