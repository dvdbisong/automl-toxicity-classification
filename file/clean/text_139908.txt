I of course will not use modern day boundaries as I can not claim such level of detail if I did Instead I can use the boundaries from back then The dispute is about where DV was located I have maps that show it not in the Croat Banovina At any rate I do not even plan on including that town on the map as it was not a major one I do not think that there will be a dispute regarding the borders of the croat banovina if I use the map that should be deleted soon
