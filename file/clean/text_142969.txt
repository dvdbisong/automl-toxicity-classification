Although youre almost certainly going to believe Im your pathetic wikinemesis I aint I just like reading up on all the sad unimportant crap that people waste their time on because it makes drinking and laughing at you and the many editors like you much more productive by comparison Also Ive seen plenty of articles including the rock lobster one which contain really basic formattinggrammarspelling errors which only further pleases me because its evidence that you care more about keeping content you dont like off of Wikipedia than keeping the articles nice and neat 

Someone like you belongs on Conservapedia
