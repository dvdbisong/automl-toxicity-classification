Arnside Knott 

Hi

In 2012 you reverted my sons edits to the Arnside Knott with snarky comments about Wikipedia policy

I have been pissed off at you since then

I believe that you should have at worst added an attribution needed tag to his edits

But instead you reverted true information because of what I perceive as your stick in the butt opinions of wikipedia policy

I am still pissed off and I still dont understand why someone would _revert_ true information rather than add the attribution needed tag

Am I missing some detail or was your behavior simply lame

Thanks
