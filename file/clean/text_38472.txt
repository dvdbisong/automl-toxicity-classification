The statement under the heading Foundation of LPFM that the minimium power for a commerical FM station is 6000 watts is simply false  6000 watts is the maxiumum permitted effective radiated power ERP for the lowest class of fullpower FM stations Class A  many Class A stations operate well under 6kW ERP for example KFAI in Minneapolis currently operates with 900W ERP and formerly used just 125W ERP  A number of other factual misrepresentations are present in this article though I dont have sufficient time to address them at the moment
