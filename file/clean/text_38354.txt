I have no objection other than a weak one to pointless churn if someone replaces a comparable Java example with a C one Adding another example though would be a problem as it would fail to add any value from the standpoint of this article Java practice is largely comparable to C You seem to have little faith in WPs ability to maintain an article You claim that code cant be kept valid you claim that having one example leads to a plethora What evidence do you have for this or that they cant be pruned
