re Israel HaShlema 

Hello
I did not remove your addition of phrase Hebrew phrase Israel HaShlema I merely added backin the link to the Wikipedia Greater Israel article That phrase is English and this is the English edition of Wikipedia 

Coverage on Wikipedia should not make a subject appear more notable than it actually is The phrase Greater Israel returns 607000 pages on Google and about 16500 references in Google Books Eretz Israel Hashlema only returns 361 web pages and 84 references in Google Books In order to be notable enough to appear in Wikipedia an idea should be referenced extensively and Greater Israel is obviously very common terminology that belongs in the list
