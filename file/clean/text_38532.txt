It is really troubling when my edits are getting reverted I do not understand why people are reverting my edits and saying they unconstructive etc meanwhile I just listed about 10 pages and yet all the flags are still on those pages I do not understand why you have some sort of fetish with my edits Since there are these rules people are mentioning about flags why are people only taking them seriously on recently added pages and not on the pages that have been there for some time now
