Why 
Ill leave it here because I do not want to embarrass you we all as humans are inheritly non neutral your edits such as this one  is one of the reasons Ive decided to vote in the way I did Your deletion had references to back it up we could get into a whole theological discussion but that would prove futile I fear to cut to the chase I think your delusioned That does not mean your a bad person My friend If you say Im banning you from Wikipedia because Im voting to Scientology topic ban you you are on Wikipedia for the wrong reasons I from now on will abandon the subject of your banning I hope I have not offended you in any way thank you That is enough explanation for a whole day   
The problem is I did not delete your paragraph even though I could have done it per WPBRD Instead I MOVED it on the talk page to sit there until the media news story settled into some encyclopedic occurrence Point is Wikipedia is not a news source WPNOT so if there is something developing in the media we should wait until it has settled Thats why I moved it Your argument is nil so I still do not understand why you are attacking me
