Unprotect on Černová tragedy 

Hi Ged  I was recently looking around at indef fully protected articles and seeing if there are any that might be eligible for unprotection  I realize that Černová tragedy has a colorful history but I wanted to get your thoughts on unprotection  I dont have any edits to contribute but I figure not all editors that want to contribute may know how to request edits to protected pages or request unprotection  Additionally perhaps further issues on this page could be addressed by semiprotection  blocks of socks  You know more of the history than I which is why I put this here and not over at WPRFPP  Hope youre doing wellTC
