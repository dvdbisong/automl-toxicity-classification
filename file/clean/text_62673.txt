Could you please explain 

Id be very grateful if you would return to the  on Shona Holmes and explain
your BLP1e assertion  Several contributors to that discussion have pointed out that her precedentsetting 2007 lawsuit is a whole other event  We have argued that this article encompasses at least two events  Of course you are entitled to disagree  But I would be very grateful if you explained why you discounted the civil meaningful and specific counterarguments to BLP1e
