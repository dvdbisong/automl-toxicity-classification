No just one In the morning 4 June 2011 I posted a message at Mr Gearlooses talk page from my present account about the VanishedUsers editing  I cannot tell if Mr Gearloose read my message before User2over0 blanked it for unknown reasons 8916012474 seems stable since a year or so but my account has been changing from time to time by moves of my Internet supporter I usually do not monitor it 

svUserGyrogearloose is familiar to me from the Swedish wp where he har been editing for years mostly on protoscience biology and physics plus downhill sports I cannot see how his possible understanding of outing would affect my not doing so
