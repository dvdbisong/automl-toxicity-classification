Jared Israel and GilWhites split  accusations related to Rabbi Wise 

I have changed the link that Jared Israel added to footnote this assertion from a link to Israels own page to a neutral page Israpundit on which the a debate between the two ocurred I think it is unfair for one side of the debate to be able to bias it by linking the claim to their own page and I think adding the neutral link is the most unbiased and fair thing to do I would ask that Mr Israel please refrain from changing this link back again to his own page as per the wikipedia guidelines on multiple reverts and linking to your own page Talk
