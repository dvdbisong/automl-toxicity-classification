Advertising

Theres a line for Total Comfort Insulation that appears to be more of an advertisement than a reference to another article  I had removed it previously along with some realphebetizine but the person who put it there originally reverted the whole change  I realphabetized the list but kept the line in although it really does not belong unless theres an article entitled Total Comfort Insulation here in Wikipedia that it can refer to  without such an article and just a reference to someones name it looks like advertising which I believe is prohibited  Im not going to start a revert war  someone else can delete it if appropriate
