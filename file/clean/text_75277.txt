Suggested merges

The following articles have a lot of duplication with Japanese grammar Either Japanese grammar should be sensibly sliced up and distributed or these articles should be merged here

 Japanese verb conjugations

Why do you want to merge this page into the already overlong Japanese grammar This page is intended to be a comprehensive reference list of verb conjugations in Japanese It will make Japanese grammar too long The tables on Japanese grammar are illustrative and the tables on Japanese verb conjugations are comprehensive   

 Japanese consonant and vowel verbs

Dont merge this page It is a reference page where I am going to put the lists from the scilangjapan FAQ Please see the link  

  

 I want to merge them because there is needless duplication I would be happy to discuss how to divide up Japanese grammar into a collection of smaller but more focused articles Incidentally please respond below instead of interspersing your responses which makes the flow of dialogue impossible to follow   

 First you put a sign on the article I wrote suggesting a merge and then you say you want to discuss breaking up the Japanese grammar article into smaller pieces which is a contradiction Please decide what you want to do before you start sticking merge signs on pages  

 The merge is still the suggested course of action Anyway it appears that arguing with you would be fruitless Do whatever you wish   

Thank you for your permission I find the current Japanese grammar article very hard to grapple with There seems to be a lot of detail in some places and then great big gaps in other ones For example there are lots of examples about jibun and aresorekore but on the verbs it says very little relatively speaking and there is lots of rather dense stuff about historical Japanese and sumite becoming sunde and the use of the names like renyoukei and kami ichidan doushi which actually dont mean very much  basically it has too much terminology I was originally thinking of editing  Japanese grammar into what I thought would be a better form but after a few trial edits and test questions I felt rather concerned about the response I would get so I decided to avoid trouble by doing minor edits only on the Japanese grammar page and creating supplementary articles for the things I wanted to add I would like to aim for simplicity and unity and focus in the supplementary articles I hoped it would be a reasonable compromise and here even you suggest splitting the Japanese grammar page but if you object to the articles I have made I suggest detailing the problems rather than merging Also I wonder why you thought of merging my pages when the page Japanese language has a grammar section which is extremely bloated and really does need to be merged into Japanese grammar If you want to merge something I would suggest the most in need of merging is the great mass of untamed and unfocused edits on Japanese languageGrammar rather than my modest pages which are fairly wellfocused and form a valuable supplement to this page in my opinion

 Stem forms 

Hello I wonder if there was some particular reason why the order of the stem forms does not follow the standard order of 未然連用終止連体仮定命令  Anything I read about these six forms always states the forms in that order and if it is classical Japanese 仮定 is replaced by 已然 the perfective and in fact dictionaries simply state the six forms of a particular verb etc in that order without specifying which is 未然 連用 etc  I think the forms here should be put in this standard order   0303 2005 May 13 UTC

No objection from me Go ahead Incidentally it would be more accurate to call izenkei the realis rather than the perfective Note that the classical perfect forms tari nu etc attached to the renyoukei Also cf Shibatani pp 221225  UserKaustuv
