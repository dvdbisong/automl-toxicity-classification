Your point of view is valid and my rv should have been a more detailed rv deletion of text without prior discussion or concensusor something to that effect As for it being vandalismthe user has been given many warnings and been rvd by many usersrvs with summaries popups VP etc as his edits have been considered vandalism by quite a few others besides myself Ignoring all warnings attempts to dialogue or simple explanations as to why he refuses to got through proper stepstalk pages before erasing entire sections the user still continues his single purpose attack on varying articles I am certainly not a fan of trivia sections either But they exist throughout Wikipedia and like any long standing section in any article needs discussion and concensus before being turfed Right Cheers
