Having read the material that seems mostly to be something being used to undermine the witness in the media and I guess at the trial Generally we do not deal with such material unless it becomes very pertinent ie the court rejects their evidence because of it I dont see that as having happened yet so I see no reason to include issues of mental health Its just more POV pushing Oggi is probably not the greatest of sources here it is tabloid someone likened it to Time above not by half I am afraid They have editorial oversight but tend to be more gossipy than anything else Id treat it about the same as the Daily Mail perhaps a bit worse  Errant chat
