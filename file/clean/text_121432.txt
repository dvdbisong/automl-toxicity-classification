Interesting so you have read this but you refuse to respond to the accusations you know them to be highly merititious  Im still trying to figure out the appropriate channels to figure out how to prosecute an arbitrator abuse case but until then Id be VERY interested to hear your defense since youve not ever attempted to make a single one beyond vague general accusations  I think I may open a Request for Arbitrartion against you if necessary but obviously thats problematic when youre dealing with arbitrarors who made the error in question
