The novels articles
Ive been perusing the articles on the individual Hornblower novels recently and I noticed that most of them are in need of some work Ive begun general cleanup eg fixing spelling wording and wikilinks but if anyone is willing to help Id appreciate it I think it might be nice to expand the articles about each novel Sorry for posting this here but I figured it would be ignored if I put it on the individual talk pages Thanks
