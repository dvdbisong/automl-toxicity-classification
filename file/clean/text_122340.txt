Yes the above IP is AHLM But I can say with a high level of accuracy that the other troll IPssock accounts are not I would agree that AHLM is not the perfect example of a good editor and may have attitude issues But that is something that could also improve over time He needs to be instructed and guided firmly Theres a high possibility that his account is compromised and hes been shut out for the wrong reason not that it excuses his other actions I have been long enough on Wikipedia to see newby editors maturing over time and later becoming very constructive and even an asset to Wikipedia That is why I would be willing to lend some good faith to AHLM But before that AHLM has to 1 sort out the behaviour issues and 2 use the correct procedure and that is already specified He also needs to sort out the securityrelated issues with his account and computer if someone else is messing around  talk
