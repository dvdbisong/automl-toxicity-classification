Thank you for this  I have reviewed the policies regarding content disputes  I have issued a message to the user I have a content dispute with to see if we can come to a resolution  I have specifically indicated to them that so long as they source Mazaherys opposition to the complaint that was filed against her then it would make sense to post comments to that effect  I have also explained to them that lawsuits are public so if Mazahery did file an opposition and present evidence in her defense then the user should have access  If the matter escalates what should we do

My other concern is the user Allconsidereds potential attempt to out me in the history page  An attempted outing was tried once and removed by a Wikipedia administrator  It is being attempted here again  Any advice and direction would be appreciated
