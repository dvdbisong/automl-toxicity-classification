Your Eminences and Excellencies in the Field Of Prophecy 

The Prophecy list known as of Saint Malachy refers to the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church 
Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone named Pietro and born in Romano thus Peter the Roman

Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone in the absence of a Pope was thus and in fact fulfilling in the Office of  Pope in Charge and now to some extent he Tarcisio Pietro Evasio Bertone along with another office in the Vatican hold more power than the actual Pope thus his Office is of a more intricate and hands on job of power than that of a Pope

In relation to what is referred to the destruction of Rome and the Terrible Judge

This part of the Prophecy is yet to come and we are in the momentum of the early days of such events
