By going through the websites I was capable of establishing a final evaluation for all the websites I noticed that all four of the websites have a dark background dark gray and a light font on the writing white This makes it easier and clearer for people to read Also enlargement of the font would have made it more improved In my opinion leaving the whole text in all the websites in a normal font and not an italic font would be much more readable particularly to old people and people who have sight problems In addition while looking into the data in the websites you can clearly notice the politeness of the text which makes the websites suitable for people from all age groups From searching the websites I have observed the fact that there are completely no advertisements or commercials which help the reader to realize that the websites are reliable Hence some of the data entered in the websites are taken from unfair sources For example Graham Browely is the ex manager of the band thus he is expected not to be supporting the band and imply negative points concerning their new album Also Mike Jones is the current manager of the band it is predictable of him to pronounce all the positive points about the band for the sake of advertising their new album All websites are provided with quotations that are told by important people It is essential for people who are interested in the subjects of the websites to also be interested in what important people have to say about the issue This helps provide people with what they are looking for I could not help but notice the link added on the end of the page in Mike Jones website which works perfectly well This link is helpful for all people who are fans of Mike Jones and it leads them directly to his personal profile Graham and Mike Jones websites show the date It is apparent that Mike Jones website is more up to date than Grahams It is essential for a website to be up to date to stay interesting for the people viewing it In my opinion the most suitable website is the Joan Hoarse magazine website The only thing that is missing is the date The date gives the readers the feeling of loyalty that they are reading something that is new and interesting
