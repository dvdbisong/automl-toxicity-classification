Bush is the man 

He had the balls to dispose of Saddam and declare war on Islamic fundamentalism Regardless of how he went about doing it or his interest in oil he did it He can have the oil if thats what he wants in return for ridding the world of religious tyranny hopefully starting the beginning of the end for religious dominance in this world There have been almost 1400 years of Islamic tyranny not to mention other religions including ROMAN Catholicism for that matter in this world and finally someone steps up to put an end to it Just look at Europe it is moving towards an Islamic majority Do you want a recap of the Paris riots in the rest of the world Of course it would be more extreme if they were the majority and minorities were in charge God forbid an Islamic world government
