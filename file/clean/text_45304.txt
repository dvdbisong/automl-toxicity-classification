Another History Merge 
Hi Tra Ive come across another history merge that needs to be fixed similar to the reconstruction that was applied to NewmanHaasLanigan Racing and Yates Racing last month The edits made to Wood Brothers Racing prior to August 14 2006 need to be moved to JTG Racing Once that is done the edits to Wood Brothers prior to August 14 2006 need to be moved to Wood Brothers Racing A major problem here is that as it stands now the Wood Brothers Racing page started as a completly different article Thanks
