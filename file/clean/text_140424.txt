Juusan 

Because the article you wrote at Juusan was little more than a statement about yourself I moved it to your user page at UserJuusan I also deleted the article Xtrinity because it just a minimal page about your personal site You can say more or less whatever you want on the user page but as a rule we dont allow people to write about themselves or to a lesser degree their projects in the article namespace

Try not to let yourself get overwhelmed by whats happening in relation to the articles youve written Youre making a bunch of ordinary newbie mistakes and were just trying to keep things tidy   0649 May 24 2004 UTC
