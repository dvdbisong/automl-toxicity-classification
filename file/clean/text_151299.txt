I have just spoken with Mr Pettersen via phone and have sent all of the remarks from  to him online He first and foremost wants to greatly thank   for their kindness in the matter and also said that DGG made up outrageous lies He is greatly concerned that DGG is an editor as some of his remarks were so grammatically incorrect on talk pages He can also confirm that he has not been involved in any sort of blogging on bullying and he can also confirm that he has never been an author Mr Pettersen would also like to know if there is a more senior administrator that he can bring the matter up with as DGG has been so extremely disrespectful We can completely confirm that the past articles about David Pettersen were never about the David Pettersen that is currently running for school board 

Here is one of our talksDoes this seem respectful

Me Hi Would we still be able to receive his old articles posted in the past and the one that was just posted yesterday We were wondering if we could receive and retain those records for review Thank you for your time 
DGG not in this case Now or ever Your talk p has the explanation you are either engaging in advertisement or harassment BTW you may not under any circumstances remove something from another persons talk page 

Is that the way an editor should talk to a new Wikipedia user
