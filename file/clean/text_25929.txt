The issues you had with the text have been addressed with the text rewritten not deleted you could have rewritten the text yourself or bought these issues up with editors but you didnt you just removed notable information I had a look through your edit history and you have a history of deleting text you have a problem with instead of writing flagging or telling other editors via the talk page Your view on deleting first and ask questions later is a bit hostile for editors how have spent months on the articles and have no idea of any issues it has so please stop shouting POV and start working with editors who have the same goals as you doh
