Why am I leaving Wikipedia 

 take a good look at my user page I believe it documents that fact that I have been a long time contributor of good articles related to my many years of engineering experience

So why have I decided to leave Wikipedia Because I have grown weary of the revisions made by unexperienced people who think they know a subject when they really dont know it I am also weary of people who make revisions because they know better than anyone else In particular the actions of one young postgrad student who calls himself Headbomb with whom it is impossible to reason because of his firm belief that he is infallible  and that he and only he knows better than anyone else His attitude has finally been the last straw in making my decision to leave Wikipedia I am simply tired of trying to reason with the likes of Headbomb

Goodbye to all the friends I did make here in the past two and a half years or so
