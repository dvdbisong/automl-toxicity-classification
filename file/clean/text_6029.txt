It was about content 

There is a lot of content in those photos and I give a headsup about the commercial nature of the site for those who might feel that they will not be able to resist the offer for sale of the images  Those images have a lot of content in them and you are being a hairsplitter by ripping them out just because copies of them are for sale  To do shun all art museums that have a shop atteached to them Get a life I am putting that link back
