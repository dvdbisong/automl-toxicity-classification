ILPs block 

Youve been blocked for 24 hours for continued reinsertion of private material If you do this again you will most likely be banned as the community has really had enough of you You havent contributed anything recently and your edits have pretty much solely consisted of attacks on administrators posting of private information and agitating for the unblock of a particularly troublesome editor which I assure you will never happen Cyde Weys 

First of all Ive had quite enough of you Im sure I dont need to ask whySecondly his attacks were hardly unprovokedThird I assure you that he or me for that matter will never be silenced

Im rather busy at the moment but Ill be contacting you later And give whoever blocked me my thanks it gave me some time to think things over  Yupigo
