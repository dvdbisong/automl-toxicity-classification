Memorandum for the President discussing behavior of the Shah Gen Zahedi and Winston Churchill immediately after the coup Memorandum from the Department of State top secret circa August 1953

Prior to the 1979 hostagetaking episode the most contentious issue in USIran relations was the 1953 coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq which the CIA and British intelligence helped to instigate Numerous questions remain about the coup itself its impact and the circumstances which brought it about To what extent was Mossadeq leading his country down the path toward communist subversion Could the coup have succeeded without substantial Iranian public dissatisfaction with Mossadeqs policies Did key Iranian political and religious figures wittingly or not receive CIA payments in return for stirring up the population What effects did the coup have on the future development of internal Iranian politics including possibly radicalizing antiShah and antiAmerican opposition elements with consequences that would not be foreseen until the revolution itself

The search for answers will have to wait at least until more of the documentary record is available in both Iran and the United States Unfortunately a portion of the record on the American side will never be recovered because CIA operatives according to former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey destroyed them in the 1960s The surviving files remain locked away from public view on the grounds that their declassification even 46 years later would damage the national security Because of the obvious public interest value and historical significance of these materials the National Security Archive in May 1999 filed suit against the CIA to demand their release The suit is still pending
