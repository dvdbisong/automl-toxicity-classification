I know which is perhaps what worries me most The biggest barriers to the expansion of Wikipedias coverage of metal are its most active editors What I am concerned with here and I think you understand this is that some of the articles concern groups which actually meet WPMUSIC even though the article doesnt explicitly make this case mostly because most people who actually use the site and write the articles never read our guidelines An AMG bio  particularly in metal  is a good benchmark and Ill usually go to the mat for any group who has one In any case you picked a bad week for me to work on Wiki but Ill get to these today as I can
