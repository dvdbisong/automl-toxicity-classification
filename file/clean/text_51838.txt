I didnt even know ya 

I have no idea who you are but I was hoping to get what your source was for some weird history page  Anyhow my thoughts on your exit are likewise  I have tried to keep out of the articles that I dont have a large stake in or articles which are more or less purely scienceat least the wikipedia rules are a little less flexible with science  On the other hand like most things the theory is nice but in reality weve got human nature to put theory in its place  Best of luck using your brain for more worthy things  And thanks for your contributions
