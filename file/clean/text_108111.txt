There has been some section heading renaming going on recently at List of current French Navy ships with frigates getting tagged destroyer and avisos getting attention both as frigates and corvettes  I have returned the section headers to the earlier descriptions but it may need some monitoring and maybe some Talk discussions on the talk page if the problem does not go away I found the Avisos described as Aviso corvette light frigate  earlier today Guided missile frigatesdestroyers The French Navy has three frigates currently active in an antiaircraft role with a fourth currently on sea trials was the other instance I reverted today
As we engaged in some degree of discussion on this matter on the Talk page we would have a reasonable argument to put forward that the matter has been discussed and consensus on the matter agreed to in regard to this  article Knowing the way these things can go I thought it best to seek your engagement sooner rather than later

Regarding Jeanne dArc R 97 some recent citable info turned up on the net so the article on the ship has been updated to some effect Have a look over it if you have the time It could still use some decent documentation of the actual life of the ship but at least the end days have a bit more resoulution now Felix
