Chick Flick 
I disagree with the definition of Chick Flick and have issue with it partly of personal definition and somewhat justifiably as it is uncited Chick Flick is not simply about the popularity with women but with women as a target audience and not necessary a romance or have romance as a main theme learned in school looking for reference Just think of the more recent chick flicks like Boys on the Side arguably about failing romance but the uniting theme is their friendship Thelma and Louise again female partners in crime Riding in Cars With Boys despite the title the larger theme is her relationship with her father and her son not just her boyfriendhusband and The Women female friendships where only one friend is truly affected by her lack of romantic relationship with her husband 

Im not ready to remove it yet as currently chick flick redirects to a Charmed episode and it deserves a mention somewhere else Id be so happy if someone beats me to the punch as it may take a while to find references now that I no longer have access to online journals However it shouldnt stay as it is
