Kohoutec So far heres what Ive found Here its listed on Dutch Charts Its All Over Now Baby Blue but with the 1973 sleeve  This link Them Again shows Baby Blue as one of the songs for the recording session for Them Again  Heres also a mention in J Rogans book that the arrangement was actually worked out separately before the session for Them Again Like everyone else on the pop scene in late 1965 Tommy Scott readily acknowledged the importance of Bob Dylan and was eager for Morrison to cover Its All Over Now Baby Blue After several hours work on the Dylan track at Regent Sound pianist Phil Coulter went home and Scott called a break  The number wasnt going down Scott remembers Van wasnt sure Then the guys said he didnt fancy it and thought it was cheap because Id tried to go after the Here Comes The Night tempo Scott reconsidered and after picking up a blues riff a new arrangement emerged apparently with added piano work from Peter Bardens Engineer Bill Farley modulated the sound and Morrison provided one of his most expressive vocals pp 137138 Rogan Van Morrison No Surrender  It then goes on to say After the preliminaries at Regent Sound Them were booked into Deccas studios to record their next album which was Them Again  my notation Ill continue looking but info is sparse on the single release for this   1813 6
