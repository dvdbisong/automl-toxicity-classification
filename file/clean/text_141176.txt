Gee telling editors who have worked on the article this article has totally gone to crap in four years is hardly the way to begin a discussion about the changes you want to make  How about you stop with the superior attitude which looking at older versions of the article I dont think is merited in any case and start over again with a more collegial point of view  I for one wont be considering your substantive suggestions until its clear that you are interested in building a WPCONSENSUS and not in bludgeoning other editors
