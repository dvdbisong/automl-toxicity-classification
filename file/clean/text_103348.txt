Good job 

Excellent work on forming those citations They really improve the article dont they If youre up to it you might try the third point in my comment on the articles talk page about adding the Infobox writer template I consider the first two points as already covered now You dont have to do this as it is an elective but if you should decide that it would be an improvement then I would encourage you to give it a try Try looking at the authors infobox on the right side in this article as an example

If you decide that you want the infobox but have trouble implementing it then let me know and Ill help you Im also going to leave you a welcome below with a collection of links to help you navigate Wikipedia You show excellent promise for being an editor here so I would encourage you to edit and write articles for the pleasure of it rather than just those that fall within your professional scope I believe you might find enjoyment in that as well as being able to share your editing contributions with others   talk
