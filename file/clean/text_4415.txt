Lol Oh my how shocking that yet another AGW activist only wants to see sources quoted from other AGW supporters Color me surprised Tell me what is this magical formula that allows someone to be quoted in this article You keep saying they need to be scientists yet these two men are clearly climate scientists But on the other hand lots of nonscientists are quoted so long as they support AGW Funny how that works isnt it You are clearly violating Wikipedias rule of Gatekeeping an article Stop it or I will report you and you will face penalties from Wikipedia admins  2028
