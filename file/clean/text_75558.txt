Braid high bulk glass fiber sleeve and extrude flexibility Silicone Rubber can withstand repeated exposures to molten steel molten aluminum and molten glass up to 2000F 1100C The heavy coating of our proprietary iron oxide red silicone rubber compound sheds molten metal splash immediately so very little heat transfer occurs 
When exposed to flames the silicone rubber transforms into a crust creating a protective SiO2 refractory layer
Excellent modulus of elasticity makes it an ideal choice for bundling hoses tubes and cables in a variety of hostile environments
