I am NOT DOING ANY MORE UNPAID EDITING OF MY WIKI BIO OR ANY OTHER ARTICLE

Go ahead Ban me from editing Im a professional writercopy editor so its your loss not mine not that I was ever going to do any future editing after all the typos you amateur copy editors have made on my bio since I tried to fix the typos beginning July 7 2013

As Ive already posted on Gorillawarfares Talk page FaraoneGFY 

Go ahead and ban me you little Napoleon I dont give a fast flying rhymes with muck Im through with you amateurs

Or delete me as unnotable Unlike you Wiki editors who seem convinced of your own notability or least the power to ban people and insult them make judgment calls on whats signifcant and whats not in Wiki article

Now back to my REAL work writing for
