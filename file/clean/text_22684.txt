Broyce Jacobs
I am just doing some basic research on creating an article for John Thompson MLA for Cardston from 1975 to 1986 I noticed that B G Jacobs nearly defeated John Thompson as a Social Credit candidate in the 1979 general election I cant find any sources indicating that the Broyce Jacobs representing CTW has the middle initial G Can you help dig something up
