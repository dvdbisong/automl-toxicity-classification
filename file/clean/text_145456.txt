Youre the one whos making an edit war out of this friend  It doesnt matter how long youve lived in whatever region that doesnt mean you know anything about the dialect thats spoken there  No offense thats just how it is  I lived in the Midland for most of my life but that doesnt mean I know squat about the dialect spoken there  Im sure there are linguists who know way more than I do about the Midland dialect  I can speak it but that doesnt mean I know much about it  People dont seem to understand this concept  Also personal experience doesnt mean anything on Wikipedia no matter how true or false it is  Its called original research here  Theres no need to get angry about this stuff its just linguistics its not like anyone insulted your mother or your cat or whatever you hold dear  Keep in mind also that it is possible to live in a region ones entire life and not speak with the accent associated with that region ie some people in the South have accents that are more similar to those of the West or Midland  The same might be true for the Inland North  Read this  Specifically read p 139 where it says Transitional Cities  It explains this a little bit though not as much as I would want it to  Maybe you can find a more in depth explanation elsewhere like in the real Atlas of North American English  Thats all I have to say
