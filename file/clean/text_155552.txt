Your userpage was briefly delisted by a rogue admin

You have a userbox TemplateUser UN which links your userpage to United Nations Wikipedians There is currently a movement to ban userboxes from Wikipedia which are shared and which create Lists of Wikipedians  Certain admins have taken it upon themselves to preemptively sabotage andor delete such categories and template  Here is the incident report which reported damage to yours in which hundreds of userpages were delinked from categories without the users knowledge They have been stopped barely and the damage reverted for now

There is a WikipediaUserbox policy poll which if passed will make required by policy the damage done to categories and templates such as User UNUnited Nations Wikipedians  If you do not want this to happen I urge you to vote Oppose in the poll Support is currently running at about 66 and your vote could make the difference It is said to require 7580 to be deemed reflective of consensus

Thank you
