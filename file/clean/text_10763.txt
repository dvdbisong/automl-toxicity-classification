Enough these bands need to go Vol 1 

Since someone cant just listen and understand the music I guess it has to be done the hard way There are plenty more that can go but Ill start with one set

Funeral For a Friend  the band themselves even know they arent emo says so in the reference and anyone that listens to them knows they dont play emo They dont have emo influences Deftones Iron Maiden Get Up Kids and they never playedtoured with bands in the emo scene Theyre nothing more than one of those melodicpost hardcore bands with the 00s decade sound

Hawthorne Heights  see above Same thing no matter if its as HH or when they were called A Day In the Life

Ida  first of all that reference does not even mention Ida as being an emo band It says folk And if you actually listen to Ida it is nothing more than indiefolk music Just because the guy was in The Hated doesnt mean its emo They never belonged here and nowhere on their wiki page does it mention emo

Joan of Arc  similar thing to Ida Yes they had members of Capn Jazz but they took a different direction from their old band and were playing indie rock

The Juliana Theory  stunned that they would even be mentioned or maybe not given some others Not only could you not find an influence of emo in their sound but theyre really a lot closer to the alternative scene youd hear on any radio station than even being mentioned in the indie or poppunk groups Solid band but nothing to do with emo

Lostprophets  already mentioned somewhere around here One little blurb by some guy that doesnt know what hes talking about doesnt count This band never had anything to do with emo Not saying theyre a horrible band because thats not the point They just dont belong on a list of emo bands

And 30 Seconds To Mars as listed above need to get out of here as well
