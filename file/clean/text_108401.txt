One person many valid names 
Ive added the words also known as Hillary Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton to the intro which seems to be appropriate regardless of the decision regarding this move As far as I can see she has had or used the following names

 Hillary Diane Rodham her official birth name
 Hillary Rodham the name she was most commonly referred to by before her marriage
 Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton her official name after taking her husbands name
 Hillary Rodham Clinton her preferred name for herself both then and now
 Hillary Clinton the name the public knows her by which is also the name she primarily uses in her official campaign materials

All of these names are or have been in their respective contexts valid names for the same person
