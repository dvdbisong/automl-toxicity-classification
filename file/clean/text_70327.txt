it seems you have not even bothered to read the contents of my posting above Let me repeat myself I RAISED THE ISSUE ON THE TALK PAGE before this became a revert war If you wish to ignore that point thats your perogative but if you decide to revert and then block the site I am afraid thats far from being considered a neutral stance I dont know if you realize this but with your arrogant attitude and actions you have succeeded in making this matter a whole lot worse If you were truly neutral on this matter you would have raised the issue with me and warned me regarding blocking the site You did none of that a bit like shooting the prisoner and then asking questions In light of the above I again ask you to reconsider
