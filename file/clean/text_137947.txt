WTAN

Actually I was fairly careful when I sorted out stuff on WPAN just after it was set up to make sure things were in the right context and I think your comment was in the right place with all similar comments However since you originally posted it on TBSYDs Talk page before he moved the entire lot to WPAN you have every right to delete it from WTAN I just wanted to reply to your unknowing  comment on my sortingout  talk 1829 26 Dec 2004 UTC
