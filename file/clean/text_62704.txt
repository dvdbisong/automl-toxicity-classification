No under international norms Kosovo is still a part of Serbia This is viewed in the fact Serbia is an internationallyrecognized country with a claim over Kosovo  and Kosovo which claims independence isnt Next to that there is the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 according to which Kosovo is still a part of the Republic of Serbia and which is still valid for the supreme governing body of Kosovo the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo 
Nevertheless I have show already before how the European Commission for Enlargement depicts its view over Kosovo under UNSCR 1244 Next to that the Stabilization and Association Agreement that has been initiated by the end of the last year will be unchanged and signed very soon with the Serbian authorities confirmed today by the Director for West Balkans of the EC It refers to Kosovo as if a part of Serbia under Article 135
