Utter nonsense showing exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia

This article reads like a press release and uncritically accepts the claim that the CL is a civil rights organization whose primary purpose is fighting bigotry when in fact they attack anyone who criticizes any aspect of Catholicism no matter how politely or correctly they actively proselytize for Catholicism as the one true religion and their leader William Donohue who is for all practical purposes their only member has made numerous antiJewish statements It is also a lie to say that the CL is a lay organization not controlled by the Church when in fact their office is located within the Archdiocese of New Yorks headquarters and they work closely with the Archbishop to coordinate media strategies

The NPOV and antilibel policy on Wikipedia has become an accept anything everyone says without blinking an eye and dont criticize anyone on relevant grounds policy because none of the editors here actually know anything about the subjects of the articles If someone who was not a fifteenyearold animewatching idiot could actually become an administrator around here maybe we could see an article on the Catholic League actually discuss what the Catholic League is known for in American politics Instead we get nonsense criticism sections telling us things like what PETA thinks of Beyonce Knowles while anything of actual relevance to the world today is declawed for fear of offending people who dont like the truth or for being sued for libel due to a poor understanding of the law
