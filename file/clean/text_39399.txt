Simply Wrong 
In regards to the changes made by Cernica  The thought that you are trying to insert mainstream scientists disagree with most of his theories and methodsis allready addressed in a neutral fashion at the end of the paragraph  The sentence you keep changing is a seperate and different statement  While the adjective offbeat in the text a propounder of theories on astronomical topics that are considered offbeat by many mainstream astronomers can be read as referring to topics or theories it makes more sense to refer there to theories and later in the paragraph to the pseudoscientific allegations lest the intro paragraph become POV in regards to the wrongness of his theories  And making statements or implications  which your added text definitely does that he is wrong is definitely not in line with a neutral point of view
