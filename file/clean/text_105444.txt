Removal of inconvenient facts and fabrication of new facts 

WNRI has an effective radiated power of 2500 watts per day and 18 watts at night   WNRI finds this fact to be extremely inconvenient because advertisers know that an 18watt night signal wont get their message out as far as theyd like  Wikipedia is not here to help WNRI sell advertising

Furthermore saying that this station is in the Providence market is a total fabrication  Driving around the Providence city limits with a car radio WNRIs signal is unreliable at best  Home radios dont pick it up well either  Again this is being added to the article to help WNRI get advertising  By saying that theyre in the Providence market it makes the station look more attractive to advertisers  Again Wikipedia is not here to help WNRI sell advertising
