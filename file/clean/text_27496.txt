Yes exactly The material in the lead just summarizes in one brief sentence the later paragraph on Boswells material That is what the lead is supposed to do
On the blog first it does not mention Sergius and Bacchus the subject of this article Its just a general criticism of Boswells ideas the mere fact that an image of the saints appear on the cover of his book is immaterial Moreover its a selfpublished blog and not acceptable as a source here Time to move on
Your current addition of the Harvey is also redundant as we already say that Boswells methodology and conclusions have been disputed by many historians and include six citations for it Ironically you are only adding more weight to this particular part of the article tc
