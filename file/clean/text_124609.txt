Umm Im not touching the actual content of this dispute with a tenfoot pole So please no one accuse me of taking sides here But I do agree with Richard that an article talk page is an utterly inappropriate location for this conversation Perhaps instead of an article talk page or LMs user talk page this should go on the Wikiquette alert noticeboard or something Anything Just not here If I were a new user Id be scared away from Wikipedia if I saw a discussion like this on an article talk page
