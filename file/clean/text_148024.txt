Lets recap After the Gibraltarpedia controversy broke last month existing Gibraltarrelated DYK nominations were put on hold while a discussion took place on options for dealing with them and with future nominations Andreas did not participate in that discussion Its outcome is summarised in the box at Wikipedia talkDid you knowGibraltarPediA Options There was nearly unanimous agreement that DYKs should go forward as long as they met the DYK requirements and that any COIpromotional aspects were explicitly addressed by reviewers A temporary requirement for a second reviewer was also added to ensure improved scrutiny of the nominations As a result of the brief moratorium a backlog built up of articles that had temporarily been held back from the Main Page This backlog has now almost entirely been cleared There has been no suggestion that any specific article should not have run because of being promotional Andreas is wrong to claim that there was an agreement to run one a day In fact there was no consensus on this suggestion There are further articles now in the nomination queue awaiting review but there is no reason to suppose that they will appear at the same frequency I anticipate that they will appear over the course of several weeks 

Lets be clear Andreas is taking an extreme position that any article on any topic relating to Gibraltar is promotional and should not be allowed even if it passes every DYK criterion and even if there is no conceivable promotional aspect Cases in point Gibraltar Cross of Sacrifice a war memorial Trafalgar Cemetery a disused historic graveyard Moorish Gibraltar a history of Gibraltar from 711 to 1462 This position has been rejected by the vast majority of people who have commented on this issue He cites outofcontext quotes from a YouTube video while ignoring the fact that nobody is directing the development of these articles  people are simply writing about things that interest them whether or not they have any promotional value He ignores the fact that specific topics have often been the subject of frequent coverage on DYK Recent examples have included the Olympics and Paralympics racehorses 120 DYKs Indonesia 300 DYKs in the last year mushrooms Bach cantatas and so on In absolute terms these have had a far greater amount of coverage and higher frequencies In short Andreas is singling out one topic area and numerous goodfaith contributors who have written articles of undisputed high quality on the basis of what a couple of people who are not writing or directing articles have said about it This is wrong
