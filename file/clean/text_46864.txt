There are some good individual public schools but the greater educational system has flaws not just the public educational system FYI homeschooling can be just as bad You can see that I have Pirate Pride and if you look up Port Charlotte High School you will read it is a public school In fact Ive had several conservative teachers as well as liberal ones However people have a right to their opinions and if Im to edit at Conservapedia I should do so in a manner that is acceptable to the majority of the community there a lot of what they call public school culture I would call flaws in modern society Likewise I should edit Wikipedia in a way that is acceptable to the Wikipedia community As should you Indeed political issues and Wiki drama aside I think you have good intentions but have a compulsive urge to engage in behavior at odds with Wikipedias policies You seem to have an obsession with Conservapedia Ive yet to see you actually contribute to any articles here I sometimes have to question whether youre here to build an encyclopedia or turn Wikipedia into the next RationalWiki 

Back on topic my biggest problem with your behavior here is that you seem rather clueless That not intended to be a random insult but seriously Wikipedia does not need proof that someone is doing something to block them but rather consensus You seem to be thumbing your nose at the system here kind of like haha you cant prove it so you cant block me haha Admins will likely use that against you Sorry but thats just how Wikipedia works Wikipedia is not the United States legal system  Messages
