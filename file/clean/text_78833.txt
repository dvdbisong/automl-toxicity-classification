RE Maccabiah teams 

I understand what you mean I myself was somewhat reluctant to add them to that section at first exactly for the reason you have stated I think its a shame however to see the Maccabiah teams entirely out of the national section of all the templates It strikes me as slightly misleading arent they national teams after all Dont they compete on an international basis representing their own countries Heres an idea that I believe addresses both your and my concerns The Maccabiah teams are included into the national sections with a small text within parentheses after their names which clarifies that they are not selected by the rugby unions of each country just like this not chosen by the national rugby union Tell me what you think
By the way thanks for the welcoming message I appreciate it  190192498
