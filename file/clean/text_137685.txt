Support Current Lead  The Queen herself would be horrified if someone thought she or others regarded her UK responsibilities as more important than her other responsibilities as Head of State of the other realms I am not a royalist by heart but I am by head There is great value when there is a non political Head of State and her having many hats as it were has greatly benefited IMHO all her realms The Queen has been faultless as far as I am aware in handling this juggling act And part of the reason for that is because she does take her other roles very seriously Apparently it sometimes annoys UK Prime Ministers when she swaps hats and speaks to them on behalf of some country other than the UK They get an unfair advantage in that sense because the Queen meets with the UK Prime Minsister weekly In practical matters the legal situation is very clear and the Queen takes her various roles very seriously indeed To suppose otherwise is pure devilment
