Daniel As i indicated to you via email Wikipedia is not your plaything by which you determine what may or may not be constructive  It is a record of fact particularly historical fact For example you might not find the revelation of your own peccadillos constructive but that doesnt change their basis in fact ergo their place in Wikipedia   You might think that Wikipedia as it relates to individual schools should only contain puff pieces but by acting on that you are violating the spirit of this site as well as your stated position of being an inclusionist The world hates a hypocrite son
