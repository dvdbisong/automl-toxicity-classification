I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldnt object to the label Hes willing to write a book about manliness after all  But I dont think Im being oversensitive Ive seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss neoconservatism and the War in Iraq At one time I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles publicly identify with the belief in question at least I thought it did although I cant find the relevant passage now and I assumed thats why the comment in the article said Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim I changed the language without changing the substance There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq see Ghits for the search terms Leo Strauss War Iraq that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss since the word Straussian has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word Straussian I dont think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of but I dont like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss Thank you for the civil reply Best  MoodyGroove
