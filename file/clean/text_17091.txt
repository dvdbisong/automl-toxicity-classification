the Jewish population or To be sure the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide Nobody disagrees that Hitler armed his private army SA party while disarming the people he was about to exterminate Harcourt discusses this directly as well quoting The Nazi minister of the interior If these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the National Socialist state possess any weapons then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the Weapons Law for the population faithful to the state To  SaulWPFRINGE You keep using that word I do not think it means what you think it means Saul What part is fringe That the nazis implemented gun control That the gun control specifically targeted Jews That there are a plethora of memos diaries and documents saying Go attack the jews they are disarmed so you shouldnt have any resistance That the jews were later exterminated Please identify the specific facts which you think are fringe
