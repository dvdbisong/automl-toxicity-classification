German offer of immunity  
I repeat what iser Yannismarou deleted    Simultaneously the Greek government rejected a German offer of immunity from invasion in return for neutrality p174 

I have credited the source You can read this book for yourself  I am not saying the Greeks were not heroic or did something bad just reporting the German offer which was probably tantamount to capitulation anyway  I realize Wikipedia is a cartoon version of a real encyclopedia as its not peer reviewed so Im afraid my entry will be deleted again  In any event hopefully this Talk fragment will remain
