I can agree with you on the religion part but there are also a great many Spanishspeaking and AfricanAmerican Christians but I cannot ever recall a Lebanese marrying one of them unless they were in Latin America of course  Also there are also nonLebanese Arabic peoples who are not of a white appearance but I still dont see them associating with these groups either  James Zogbys site explains it all  Just look at the list of famous arabAmericans  How come they are either mainly white looking or whites who do not identify recognize or view themselves as Lebanese or Arabic  It is more than clear what type of arab Zogby represents  Now if his organization were called the White ArabAmerican Institute then I could go along with hime sense he would be truthful but all arabs are clearly not represented  It almost seems as if he wants America to view arabs as white and therefore only acknowledges white or whiter looking arabs Maybe that is his hidden agenda  This guy is a phony none the less
