The text of the article could have been taken from Tudjman era Croatian propaganda press The consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality or revalue the widely accepted view of Croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing particularly the plight of the citys inhabitants of Serbian nationality  about half of the total number  in the city subject to Croatian military rule or the very existence thereof parts of the text are clearly selfcontradictory the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes and full of dubious propaganda cliches the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings Naturally this does not mean that we should subscribe to the Serbian propaganda of the time  an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from ICTY proceedings from well known western reporters present at or near the scene Misha Glenny and from other sources Actually merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this
