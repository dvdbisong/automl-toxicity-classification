Agreed  

 Fear of the Dark used in a movie 

I remember hearing a rumor that Fear of the Dark was used in a Horror flick I couldnt find much on this anywhere I think it may have been one in the Nightmare on Elm street series of movies If evidence can be found for this it should be added to the Popular culture area

Reply  Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter was in Nightmare on Elm Street 5 apparently  

Damn beat me to it I agree with apparently though as Ive seen the film and I dont recall hearing the song in it Also I dont think its on the soundtrack album It may have been written for the film but not used  talk 12
