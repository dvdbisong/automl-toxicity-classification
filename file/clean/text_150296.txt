I often check STCs to find the odd combinations that dont otherwise make sense In the case of that AAN it specifies STC SA4005NM which is for the installation of a Precise Pulselite control unit in landingtaxi system You can search US STCs in several ways including by aircraft type manufacturer and STC number at FAA Supplemental Type Certificates  a good website to bookmark
