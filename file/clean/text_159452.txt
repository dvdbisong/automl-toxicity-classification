I am really sorry about your relatives but any reasonable person as I know you are should agree that the persecution of the Copts the massacre in Luxor cannot be compared to a collapsed building Copts are important part of Egyptian society I am not saying that the whole section that you deleted should be included but a few sentences should Heres an extract from Speigel Copts make up the largest Christian community in the Arab world and around 8 million Egyptians belong to the Coptic Church Theyre barred from high government positions diplomatic service and the military as well as from many state benefits Universities have quotas for Coptic students considerably lower than their actual percentage within the populationBuilding new churches isnt allowed and the old ones are falling into disrepair thanks to a lack both of money and authorization to renovate When girls are kidnapped and forcibly converted the police dont intervene Thousands of pigs were also slaughtered under the pretense of confining swine flu Naturally all were owned by Christians The same with Luxors massacre For example see article Spain It talks about bombing in commuter trains in Madrid Spain on 11 March 2004 Egypt should have a few sentences about the massacre in Luxors too
