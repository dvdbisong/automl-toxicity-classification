1 I really do not want to cause anyone more work than necessary But I cant help if someone try to suit every single article to his own fashion You just throw out everything that does not fit to your personal view Try to edit articles more for the reader and not for yourself What is wrong if one sentence is not quite adequate and explicit On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you ruin almost my whole work Who is doing fruitless work here Youre obviously to deep in the math and you cant see out anymore Try to read one original work from an original mathematician please If you would have a chance you would probably change even Gauss work Remember on what he had written about the estimation of the number of primes and such
2 Ill try to fix the table that bothers you so much Just give me some time
3 Dont call me Rasta if youre not shure what that means or if you think I am that if I bear similar cyber nickname and so on 
4 The symbol  Sometimes you like and sometimes you dont For instance it is more clear if we write once we have agreed what  means 3  9 than 3 divides 9 You have once said that any symbol in fact does not have much sence in math so here we go
5 What is wrong with Möbius function here or elsewhere When I make a table it is clear after that what values are but try to calculate its values from your mind I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject It is pointless there is no connection that needs to be mentioned That is you opinion I guess Everything is important in math specially in a number theory If I wouldnt use Möbius function I woulnt be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700 I guess here μn is more important than other arithmetic functions Thats my opinion Furthermore anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value since all they have to do is to count the prime factors which are already given in the table Yes that is true But many readers do not know at first what μn means and shows Simply as that
6 I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project You correct me and I correct you if and only if I can I am pretty tired of writting articles which envolve math but I like math very much And because you know something from the math you can give your knowledge to others and not just fixing things all around as it is going for one math test My teachers are mathematicians themselves Only you change these articles so much no one else So I cant figure that they do not understand what is written in them Egziabeher  1720 Sep 25 2002 UTC
