Please see the image talk for further details

Im concerned that important issues been raised on the image talk page such as potential deletion of the image are occuring unawares to those users who are less familiar to wikipedia than the regulars who seem determined to defend this piece of child abuse to the last under vague and naieve conceptions of what art is and how censorship operates Please pay attention to potential deletions of the image as the last deletion process went through with only a half dozen respondants ludicrous considering how many users have accessed this page in the last few days This is a serious issue which could affect the future of wikipedia as a viable project and it is up to all editors who use this website regularly Such as people like me who have never edited before but have read lots of stuff here to contribute to this debate which in reality goes to the very murky depths of human nature itself
