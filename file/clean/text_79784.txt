Possessive of Jesus 

There are a couple of editors changing Jesus to Jesuss Does Wikipedia have a preference here The rule I learned was that for proper names you add  s even if it ends in s unless the name is an ancient name containing at least one other s Jesus being the most common example Its kind of an arbitrary rule but I can certainly say that Ive seen Jesus a lot more than Jesuss and I read a lot on the subject  0747 Oct 23 2004 UTC
