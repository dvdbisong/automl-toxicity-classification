lol the slav is panicking and his friend is there to defend the heroic propaganda lolol XD
 well actually a friend of mine made the gif and actually he told me i can do whatever i want with it 
 whats your problem do i have to bring my friend in wikipedia to upload a gif well the problem is FutPerf you are problematic and officially a bad wikipedia editor as you did not notify the uploader me for your deletion proposition not to mention your propaganda welcoming and countertruth efforts 
its so obvious and so predictable propaganda for nationalistic and filthy politicalhistorical stealing reasons
First youre gonna try deleting for noncopyrighted use then for source issues or whatever then to stop it from entering articles
you can try all you want try harder kids strain and struggle i assure you nobody touches Greece especially ancient Greece even if all the Greeks move in another planet your propaganda is so cheap it cannot reach 2 centimeters
