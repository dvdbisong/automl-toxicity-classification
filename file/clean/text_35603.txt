Æµœš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators  That said you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponents view on Ebonics  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American Weddington Baugh and Green for example being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric  What I stated was that the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way  That way being from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective  I went on to state that In fact a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number iii reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all  That is the view that Ebonics is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular EnglishAAVE is Eurocentric  The other three views numbers i ii and iv are Afrocentric 

Æµœš¹ if you reread the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number ii  So let me make it clear here It is my view that the first phrse in number iithat reads to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole is definitely Afrocentric  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number ii that reads or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English languageEnglish either  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch redfine and use the word Ebonics to refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language does not make this practice Afrocentric

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time In fact I coauthored a book on the origin of the N word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic Egyptianword NGR has changed  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the N word as being derived from the Latin word niger meaning black See Ullaman etal Third Latin Book 193051 the word niger is not originally a Latin word see America Heritage Dictionary 19761531 That is while the word niger may have entered into the English langange from Latin the empirical evidence is that the triconsonant Mdw Ntr NGR is found in the ancient Kemetic Egyptian language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people NGRS of ancient India around 20001000 BC See Wallbank and Taylor19427273and Durant 1954356

In Sir EA Wallis Budges Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God Budge 1978341  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess Budge 1978398  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the N word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word ebony in any unabridged English language dictionary The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly  if we call the buildingup of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of biligualism when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved NigerCongo Africans in diappora is unfathomable
