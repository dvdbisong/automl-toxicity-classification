Its a good idea but

I found it amusing when I found this page while looking for the ages of the Patriots offensive unit this year I like the fact that it is a page but I wonder if it should include dates I mean if the Patriots switch philosophies which they do all the time even year to year then this page will be irrelevant and will need to be erased therefore losing all the hard work of the original author

Im just thinking that each strategy should have a designation for which season it represents
