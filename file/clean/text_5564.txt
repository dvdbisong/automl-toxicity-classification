Ive hidden the description of how to pronounce the sound My reason for doing so is most of all that the character is used in several languages and I believe its wrong to assume that the pronounciation is similar in all nonEnglish languages also when it is similar in some Im also convinced that an  article designated for vowelsounds would be a better place A link to such an article would surely be the best  

I do also feel awkward about the notes on being an umlaut and on alphabetization which I actually feel would fit much better in the articles on the different alphabets
