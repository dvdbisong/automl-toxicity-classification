roman pic 

Here is the entire dicuss from my page Its funny how you can talk to me on my page but come here and call me a sock   

Your statement image of roman sic which cleary state sic that it is not authentic sic and definately sic not of hannibal sic is OR 
The text attached to the image clearly states that it is RomanCapuan and only MAY not be an authentic image of Hannibal  not that it is not authentic definately not of hannibal as you so confidently aver The first statement is sourced yours is not If you have a better source give it Nor is the image of a Roman  the helmet alone is a giveaway for that   

If anyone is doing anything based on opinions its you 1st of all you changed the original writing under the bust to support your illegitimate claim that is vandalism Also those sources you speak of do not support or authenticate that this roman image is of Hannibal in anyway It would be best if we actually look time out to find an authentic image other than partake in this edit war

From Adrian Goldsworthy Cannae p24 2001 A bust which me be a representation of Hannibal in later life although there are no definite images of him This reference has been attached to the image for months and has been repeatedly deleted by you despite my repeated attempts to draw your attention to it More references follow The same image appears on the cover of Goldsworthys The Fall of Carthage 2000 as Hannibal in later life and in Goldsworthys The Complete Roman Army p41 2003 as A bust that purports to show Hannibal in later life The bust appears also on the cover of Serge Lancels Hannibal 1995 as Roman bust of Hannibal Museo Archeologico Nazionale Naples From Philip Matyszak Chronicle of the Roman Republic p95 2003 Bust thought to be of Hannibal found in Capua Brian Todd Careys Hannibals Last Battle Zama and the Fall of Carthage 2007 also uses the image as its cover illustration

There you go 5 scholars  and the museum which possesses the bust  all agreeing that the bust either is of Hannibal or may be of Hannibal Once again all I ask is that you provide just one source which supports your opinion that the bust is not authentic and definately not of hannibal as you so confidently aver Without a source for this statement your opinion is nothing but OR   

Understand that I have a life in the real world if you leave me a message I will respond to  you when  I can  so please spare the hounding Anyway you say you want me to provide a source that say the image is not of Hannibal because you have provided 5 scholarly sources that say otherwise Well I dont need to provide a source because you have already done it and have proven my point NONE of the sources you provided states that the picture is of Hannibal You yourself said that all the sources you listed said MAYBE the picture if of Hannibal then you went on to add a quote from one of your sources saying A bust which me be a representation of Hannibal in later life although there are no definite images of him You have basically proven my point if your sources arent sure whether or not the image is authentic and you actually have a quote from one saying that there are no definite images of Hannibal then that image should definitely not be there
