I wasnt trying to be bad honest  I was just putting in a few hours at the Reference Desk the other day when I noticed all the commotion at ANI about Rlevse and his antics  I keep telling myself I dont care about the project anymore but every time I see discussions ANI degenerating into proverbial pigfucks I feel theyre calling my name like Tom Joad  SOMEONE needs to show up and berate the participants
