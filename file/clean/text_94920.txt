Image question 

An image you uploaded back in October 2009 commonsFilePopulation density of Ireland map2002svg to the commons does not provide a source of where the data actually came from I am reviewing all the images in the Ireland article for a future GA nomination and wonder if you recall the source location It says that it is Based upon Republic of Ireland  2002 Census results but finding the exact source is difficult and where did the Northern Ireland information came from Cheers   
Republic Central Statistics Office 
Northern Office for National Statistics    

I dont mean to be a pedant but the Irish census of 2002 does not appear to have any population density statistics Did I miss them or did you create them from the census and some land mass data If you did that would that not be synthesis The Northern Ireland stats do have density figures but these dont coincide with the county boundaries Can you please explain some more I would like to keep this image in the Ireland article but as we are trying to get it to GA and possibly FA such matters as questioned sources tend to be an issue Thanks in advance I am watching this page for a while so there is no need to drop me a  note   
Here is the original source that I based the map on  That in turn were supposed to be based on the above two I assumed it was right and never checked though In hindsight I probably should have checked Feel free to remove or change the map     

Brilliant I will dig deeper with the source you provided as I like the image and would like to keep it in the article Thanks again Cheers

 History of citizenship in the United States 

Unfortunately Tomwsulcer has decided to leave the project FYI please see User talkTomwsulcerTerrorism prevention strategies moved to user space I had problems with this article largely because Tomwsulcer was inexperienced and did not write in a NPOV style and had real problems with being unaware of a systemic bias in his writing The article I moved was well over 150k so all in all I could see no other quick solution See User talkTomwsulcerTerrorism prevention strategies for my conversation on the article with Tomwsulcer

Because more people have contributed to the article History of citizenship in the United States you might like to open up a discussion on its talk page of what to do with the article now that the principle author has left leaving so many problems behind I would have thought that the subject is notable and drastic pruning may allow the article to remain However if the consensus solution needs an administrator to carry out an action let me know    

 Tomwsulcer also wrote Criticism of American foreign policy which is even worse so Ive sent it to AfD At least some of the History of citizenship article might be salvageable although it see
