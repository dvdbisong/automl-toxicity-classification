La goutte de pluies sockpuppetry issue
Hi Im the anonymous IP involved in the edit war with UserLa goutte de pluie over at Teo Ser Lucks page Firstly it is really beyond my control that my Starhub IP keeps changing I am really not on any proxy 

I would like to bring up something since I cant post on Administrators noticeboardIncidents board
During the edit war with UserLa goutte de pluie I noticed another anonymous IP popping up to help La goutte de pluie to revert back to his edit Also under the Talk Page it was the same person who added the questionable content about MCYS If you asked me I think that guy is also La goutte de pluie and Im saying that because during several exchanges with him thats exactly the same things he said to me over and over again
