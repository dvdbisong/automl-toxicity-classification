First of all as was once documented on the greater University of Virginia article you are described by pep band members as a Google stuffer creating a bunch of websites about the Pep Band and even trying to get searches for UVa Marching Band and such to go to your own websites  A more reliable source would be Cavalier Daily articles from the 1960s  As you could guess when my father attended the university from 19611966 and fear of State Uism was all around they didnt make webpages  But if you look back at those student periodicals from the 1960s and up to a decade earlier youll see the term was widey used to refer to the large more than a few thousand students as UVa had at the time coeducational universities  The bruhaha about StateUism came to a head when women were admitted in 1970 I had to read through all that stuff in the late 1990s for the History of UVa class that I think is still taught at the university  Youre still at the U check out the old collections of student periodicals yearbooks whatever you can find youll get a sense for the history of the term
