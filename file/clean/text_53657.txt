JP I tried to take some negative comments about Michael Savage out of his article yet they were all put back in and I was told that as long as the quotes were sourced I couldnt do anything about it So it doesnt violate NPOV to include an idiotic quote by Jackson Could you further elaborate on how Im violating NPOV or NOR If you dont Im just going to put the quote back into the article
