Well actually Ohconfucius no one was asking you but maybe your ego needs something to do other than write good articles 

I would like to see the Bot removed from GoingBatty  I would also like to see him spend 6 to 8 weeks on one article from start to finish as I do I would like him to avoid articles Im working on until I have finished them I usually add a postarticle synopsis to show Ive finished and to highlight some of the issues I encountered I would like GoingBatty to accept that scouting may be his life but due to the similarities between the Scouts and the Klan both like to creep around the woods at night in uniform while lighting fires and tying knots it hardly appeals to me and neither therefore does he appeal to me
