Dear Wilson I never mention googlebooks  You have to do an edit or open the link to find out I am using googlebooks to that publication and page for example this ref I found for the Hawker Sea Hawk that had a notice boxes stating it lacked references  ie it was not reverted and is still there Rocket Motor Doubles Power of Jet Aircraft Popular Mechanics February 1952 p 116 Either way I am going to let this Gate Guardian have his pound or kilogram of flesh and leave his revert alone Jack
