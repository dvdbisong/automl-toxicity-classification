To all editors please note that the concerns brought up by 58969412 were addressed in my last edit of the article I added the Criticisms section which details the only peerreview paper published in a physics journal critical of Prof Tiplers Omega Point Theory while also giving a number of nonrefereed book review articles which have been critical of the Omega Point Theory Keep in mind that Tiplers Omega Point Theory has been peerreviewed and published in a number of the worlds leading physics journals and so the CategoryPseudoscience tag is factually incorrect and violates Wikipedias policies of WPTruth WPNPOV and WPReliable Sources Yet still 58969412 complains even though he as yet has not stated what is wrong with the current edit It appears that 58969412 simply wants some notice or tag on this article telling people that it is bilge and that they oughtnt sake it seriously

 Im more than happy to work with 58969412 but he appears to be unwilling to be satisfied until he gets some edit which violates Wikipedia policy
