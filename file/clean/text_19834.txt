Arniep My areas of interest and work are in the fields of CategoryJews and Judaism and CategoryIsrael and Zionism so I am not getting involved in articles or issues outside of these In the case of Lists and Categories for and about Jews I am now firmly against them I think its fine to cite a few examples or to have some VERY restricted lists but things have gotten out of hand and some people are creating the craziest lists and categories for Jews that have absolutely no scholarly intellectaul or human value Its more of an obsession than a work of knowledge If its a vote on Wikipedia policy I would vote there but I am not getting involved with subjects and people about which I am not an expert Please stay in touch
