Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver
Hi thanks for the cleanup on the REBGV page  I assume from your user name that you are affiliated with the board  Perhaps just a coincidence  I dont know if the other editor  who has been editing the article is affiliated with the board or if he is a random person with an unusually strong interest in the page 

This article has been quite the little pest over the last few weeks  And unfortunately these edits have become the only things done on the article over the last several weeks  Through no fault of the board itself of course  I am only involved in this as the  edits happened to come up while I was spam patrolling  External links happen to be my beat  In any case I hope that you do enjoy editing  In the event that you are affiliated with the Board I do want to make you aware of the conflict of interest guidelines  I do urge you to read them if you plan to edit some more  Its not where I tend to spend much of my time so its hard for me to lay out exactly what the COI people look for  However they can be as zealous as I tend to be on the linkspam end  Nothing says you cannot edit  But the guidelines will help ensure that you are able to edit without creating any suspicion regarding your content

Again thanks and welcome
