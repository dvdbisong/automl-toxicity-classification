Indeed Learning curve I am amazed at how much learning I had to do in order to get the wiki privatized and fully operationalFirst off I wanted to make an ironcladsecurity main page like ArbComs wiki That wasnt too terribly difficult but there is a gaping hole in MediaWikis security in the default installation whereby all uploaded files generally images in a completely private wiki can be directly accessed by anyone familiar with MediaWiki merely typing a URL path That took some reading and trial  error MediaWikis excuse is that  MediaWiki is designed to be open to everyone maaaan Itslikeabout openness  The thing is those who dont care to think about security wouldnt mind if images cannot be viewed via intelligent URL typing However those making a private wiki who do care wouldnt want them viewable by IPsAnd then thumbnails of images wouldnt work no matter what I did to LocalSettingsphp file Like many things I would go to talk pages on MediaWiki and discover there have been many others wrestling with the same issues It turned out that ImageMagick has been omitted from recent builds of MediaWiki Moreover installing ImageMagick isnt a matter of dropping files and folders into the wiki using FTP its a Linux installer rpm and only the webmaster can do thatAnd after all that is done there are bunch of gottahave templates like Templatext Template Templatedoc TemplateHilite TemplateNbhyph TemplateNowrap and TemplateXt I think I have all the gottahaves now I was the shepherding authorsponsor on a bunch of them so Im fond of themI cant complain about free stuff MediaWiki is an amazing product that few commercial interests could match for under 1500 Ill take the poor documentation associated with opensource software any day
