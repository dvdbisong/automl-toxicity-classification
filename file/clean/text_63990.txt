Oh Im not venting at you so you have no need to apologize  Im just venting at the people who somehow thought these user categories were going to be a good idea without considering how worthless and headacheinducing they actually are  CFD wastes a lot more time than necessary trying to figure out what the optimal name for any particular user category should be when my personal viewpoint is that they shouldnt exist at all because WPENC tells us Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a social networking site so categories should be used to categorize articles not users
