Notice youre from Orange County been there a few times when I lived in Mamaroneck  Rye in Westchester Beautiful country I know Bear Mountain is up the Hudson crossed the Tappan Zee many times after visiting Sleepy Hollow ever been in the Old Dutch Church The grounds are amazing but the company is forgive the pun dead We have similar tastes in music actually let me guess Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits is on your list of favorites If not it should be Semper Fidelis
