Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and UserJza84 On his talk page Jza84 states I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time As Mangojuice notes on that same page Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a longtime established editor here Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007 over 6 months before Jza became an admin That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions I wouldnt claim that we were regular collaborators but collaborate we did and if somebody had aske me before this incident do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him I would have replied in the affirmative without hesitation The only real edit conflict I had with him prior to this was in February of this year at British Day This was resolved civilly and without rancour although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising  A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references  and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits  an effort to bring balance to a biased account in my opinion for what its worth  whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject was unbalanced However I refrained from comment see Brit Day in his talk page archive Everybody is entitled to their views I said to myself and moved on Ill admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything Ive got better things to do I could have responded to this comment on TalkNewport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people saying that Daicaregos was an advocate of Welsh nationality which doesnt exist verifiabily That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way However once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so Ignore it I told myself Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with British on a number of articles on my watchlist amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley Plaid Cymrus senior statesman Rightly or wrongly I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute and no it had nothing to do with his admin status However when I saw his edit to TemplateWelsh kingdoms also on my watchlist I will admit that I was incensed I reacted with less tact than I should have done I admit I reverted his edit Changing Welsh kingdoms to the woefully incorrect and insulting Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales seemed to me to confirm my impression of him it basically deCymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales which have a central place in our history and identity used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term petty kingdom He than undid my edit and came up with the wording Ancient kingdoms of Wales which is again quite simply incorrect medieval is not ancient Then I read his explanation on the talk page Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity quote What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh  Well no the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales Are they subdivisions of Wales  Well also no these kingdoms predate Wales by centuries Wales was a concept of the future What fools historians Welsh and others have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh and his court poets who praised him as King of the Welsh etc I said to myself At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee count to several thousand and then respond But I did not and the result is this That sets the record straight Ive already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84s decision I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the history behind this incident from my point of view I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84s page about
