reTimezones 

Hello there thanks for the message I understand that it generally takes 5 days for an AfD to run its full course Having said that I dont think its a problem to close the AfD in question and the other AfDs I closed yesterday for that matter some hours early since the results were unambiguous Its just as fine as administrators can speedy close snowed AfDs In the case of less clearcut debates please rest assured that I give the AfDs careful consideration and the appropriate time to meet their needs Best regards
