Scott if thats you you need to sign your comments  Duff doesnt use any string theory not one spit to argue his point  Scott i think that is evidence that you still just dont get it  this has nothing to do with string theory  string theory is nonsequitur  i hardly understand string theory really just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova but i fully understand the argument that in reality the only physical quantities that we measure that we perceive that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings or ET beings for that matter are dimensionless quantities  when something changes that affects us ultimately its a dimensionless measure usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity

if  changed lets say got bigger conceptually that would have meaning the electromagnetic force relative to the other fundamental interactions would have changed in proportion gotten a little bigger  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger but it might not have or that Plancks constant has gotten a little smaller but it might not have or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller thats the choice you and authors such as Moffat made or even if were gonna say that  might have changed that the permittivity of free space has changed like   is defined in many measurement systems such as SI or cgs  i doubt anyone will argue that its  or  that has changed  heck someday soon i would expect within a decade  will be defined because of a redefinition of the kilogram  if they do that then a change in  gets blamed on a change of  which still seems most natural to me but thats my opinion  even so if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean  that is all we would know or could ever know  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it is silly  1604 19 Mar 2005 UTC
