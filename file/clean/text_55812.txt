Where are Star Wars Episodes IV and V and Close Encounters of the Third Kind both are much better films than ET  Preceding unsigned comment added by 7568124228   

Which had the biggest budget  Which spent the most on advertising  Which generated the most box office receipts  Of course all of these variables are interrelated and there is no practical way of isolating one variable without compromising the others   If we ignored technological differences Robinson Crusoe on Mars Fantastic Planet Forbidden Planet The Time Machine 1960 film and When Worlds Collide are all up in the running     

King Kong
Why was King Kong remove on the list It had a sorce and everything 7117825089  
I removed it because it did not have a citation specifically mentioning it as being the best of the genre  Being one of 100 films on Times list is only a citation for being one of the the 100 best films according to Time nothing more  It seems unreasonable to imply that because there is only one film of a particular genre on a best film list the mention equals a citation for being the best of the genre  That would be original research because the film may have been selected for reasons that have nothing to do with being the best of the genre   uelWantman

While I dont disagree with the fact that you can at least narrow down several films which many consider great this page is misleading What purpose does it serve The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent and this page changes all the time People will like what they like and I think it is unfair that wikipedia a generally factual resource includes such a subjective topic as this and other polls I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music What other refutable encyclopedia does this You cannot systematically grade personal taste  Preceding unsigned comment added by 6615918159   

The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization  The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users but of a variety of organizations   

Regardless of the notoriety of the sources they dont constitute an article  The citations are to sources of opinion which should in my opinion be added to the articles of their respective films Talktome 

I believe that the page should be deleted Its very opinionated yes i know its all sourced from other people but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film there are many variants This sort of page is suited to someones blog not a Wikipedia article Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted   

Although this page somewhat irks me I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision  The article is technically 100 factual in that it is stating so and so thinks this movie is the greatest  Personally I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed  Specifically my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that in many cases I believe that with enough searching you could find somebodys list that has your favorite movie on top  Of course the failsafe against this is that editors must decide whether or not that somebody is a notable c
