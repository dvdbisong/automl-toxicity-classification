Elonka Dunin    
    
 Dont remove my comments as you have with Knights Templar You have a pattern of defending this tendentious editor She has proven to be a very negative presence on Wikipedia If you continue to abuse your admin tools you could be stripped of same You would be better serving the project if you implored Elonka to elevate above her personality problems and cuase her to attempt to play better with others
