EDIT Sarek also recently closed an MfD of Seregains userpage which contained a list of my edit history because he believed it was in bad faith however I created this MfD at the request of a third party who had intervened and advised me to do so Therefore Id say that Sarek jumped the gun here not needs to show a little more good faith himself
