my apologies 

Hello Anne I left a correction over on the WPRETENTION talkpage but I wanted to say my sorry here as well  

I wish to protest the role that 74 appears to be assigning to me here Following another editor around and cleaning up his or her deliberately left messes would be boring  

I did not mean to speak of you now I was specifically thinking of Anne Delong in December 2012  Although not yet replied on the talkpage Im currently reading through your first 500 edits which make sense given your paragraphs in the Anne Phenomenon section  

I absolutely disagree when you say following editors around and fixing their messes is boring  You worked on your own Opera article and while it was waiting in the queue made 15 grammarnazi sniperfixes to other articles in the queue  This was 20121226 that Im thinking of  You came back to wikipedia every hour for hours and hours  That is where you got addicted to wikipedia  That is why you still help out at AfC  In my ohsonothumble opinion that day is the keystone which explains the Anne Delong Phenomenon  

I want to recreate that day  Help me phrase my explanation on the WPRETENTION talkpage so that I capture what it is that brought you to love wikipedia  Hope this clarifies and apologies for mischaracterizing your contributions now when I should have been clear I was thinking of you back when you were just starting out  7419284101
