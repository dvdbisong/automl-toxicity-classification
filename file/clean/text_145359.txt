Low quality and uninformative 

This article is really bad

First this sentence 

Eric S Raymond quotes Ritchie as saying about the complexity of System V STREAMS when compared to his V8 Streams that Streams means something different when shouted

imparts zero information and is neither cute nor funny It doesnt even make sense

Second there is absolutely no information in the article about what STREAMS actually does or how it is different from sockets There is a fair amount of My schwantz is bigger than your schwantz here on the talk page but precious little info

Ten minutes search elsewhere gave me the real difference between STREAMS and sockets several articles showing tests that STREAMS was two or three times faster than sockets and a couple descriptions of why sockets would be a better choice for other tasks

No such information is contained here

Bad show chaps
