I see no reason to believe there is agreement on a signatures function and what the line is to wasteful clutter or even that there should be an agreement on those things  Editing despite the wishes of several others even if in good faith does not seem like the essence of editing a wiki  The mentioned edit is also probably not several kilobytes Im pretty sure its less than 2KB counting characters  I think you are overestimating the extent of beneficial effects and the importance of this signaturerefactoring thing
