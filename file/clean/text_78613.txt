unblockAs I said Im not Banzaiblitz  Blackguard also calls me a lone revisionist a simple search on the talk page will reveal that a consensus was reached earlier among 11 participants with only 1 dissenter  Banzaiblitz my brother and CurtisNaito both pushed for an estimate within the 40000200000 range  They were able to convince the others that that was the case  I also find it quite funny that me misspelling Banzaiblitz is used as evidence against me
