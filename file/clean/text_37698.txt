Most of the edits by username  RiceraBilby and others poorly sourced cited or factually misrepresented 

I dont think these peoples edits were done in good faith  Most of their edits seem to be done with the intention of forgiving the church and seem to be one sided mistrepresented or totally fabricated  Editors such as these bring a bad name onto wikipedia and make our community seem biased and feeble  We need to properly monitor the citations and references given and make sure they match up with what is written on the page12129873
