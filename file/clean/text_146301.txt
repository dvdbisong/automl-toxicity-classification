You are presupposing that Asparagaceae or perhaps Asparagaceae is defined under the ICN The code however claims merely to regulate nomenclature providing definitions only of words like cultivar in Appendix VII words that do not name taxa Even if you can produce a reliable source for your claim that names are defined in terms of a type and a rank a claim that is also made in the lead you have a problem with neutrality Monsch 2003 for example argues that names do not have definitions The ICN entries on this view only fix the reference of names while a definitionif one were possiblewould provide the meaning The meaningreference distinction is much discussed in recent philosophy   1623 24
