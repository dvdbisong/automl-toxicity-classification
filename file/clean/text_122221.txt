University of Portsmouth Logo 

Hi thanks for your message on my user talk about my userpage Im not sure what to replace it with because whilst the image has been uploaded to wikipedia as fair use I am aware of the University of Portsmouth having released its logo for usage on the web as downloadable image files from its website  am i still breaking the wikipedia policy if i continue to use it despite its status on wikipedia 
PS have been editing the PO Ferries page to include the POSL info
