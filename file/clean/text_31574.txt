I definitely will collect factual statistic data before proposing changes in naming Its why I only will most probably propose to replace Rus with Rus  despite Im really sure that former is much more frequently used I have to check this for sure As for Rus and Rosja you mix up two different issues and this mix adds mess to the subject a whether or not actions of NorthRussian rulers may be considered as reunification of Rus and  b evolution of sounding of word Rus These a and b are not equal I will present more facts on these issues and the discussion of course will be continued Frankly Im a bit concerned that instead of commenting prepositions that I suppose near to be facts you are discussing where these facts lead Lets first collect facts and than well think which NPOV conclusions can be made What do you think about this  1827
