RTV request little fixit
If youre going to delete the userpage and leave it redlinked Im okay with that Actually I forgot one thing and based on the fact that you didnt do it exactly the way I asked which is okay I request two modifications

Delete ImageYechielJPG if its hosted here which I think  If its hosted on Commons find someone to delete it there
Delete UserYechielMan and UserShalom now broken redirects
Remove courtesy from my user talk page I dont like it and its not necessary Retired can stay
Thanks again  Shalom
