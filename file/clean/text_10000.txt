Hi RedRose and apologies for delay Here is a draft of what I propose to present on the new section pages
The 6 volumes of Ultimate Allocations cover the reported allocations of all British Railways Steam  Diesel  Electric Locomotives on BR stock from 1950  1968 with additional information from 1948 where available They are formatted in A4 comb bound volumes for ease of use There are 3 main columns which are subdivided with individual locomotive details including date when new if appropriate All reported and published allocations and reallocations combined with withdrawal dates where known are listed on either Weekly  Monthly  or Period Ending dependant on regional variations at that time A link to several testimonials and scanned images type of information provided can be found at wwwultimateallocationscouk
Please advise if this information would be acceptable for presentation in the new section you previously advised I look forward to seeing your reply and thank you once again for your assistance in this matter
