Hi
I was one of the first editors to point out the problem and try to give you an unofficial headsup of impending issues after you first started editing under that user name  I was saddened when you did not respond to my warnings right away nor to the editor who tagged your article as he did and figured you may not have known how to use talk pages then  It appears that you may have gone through the wikiwringer but I think you will look back on your rather turbulent passage and know it made you a stronger and better editor for having survived it 

Apparently you have not forgotten your real world manners about Please and Thank You  The fact that you took the time to find your helpers under a new user ID and reach out to us speaks well of your character  Stay strong 

Cheers
