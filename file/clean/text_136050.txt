Why the distortions and falsehoods being posted by antipopper elements on this page 

Its a shame that the antipopper persons here are now growing even more bold in their posting of false information on this page

The continued posting of false information in the Disclaimers of manufacturers section is a case in point

No where in the popper dealers web site does he have the words You Could Die The abuse of these products can kill you  Yet no matter how  many times someone reverts this section to the actual content of the site each time it is quickly reverted back to the false statements

Such inappropriate behavior by posters here is more than simply a disservice to wikipedia
