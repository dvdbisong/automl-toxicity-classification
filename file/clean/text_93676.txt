do unto others 

I see that you have for the third time in a few minutes added an unencyclopedic remark about Ann Coulters sex life You are disrupting the page and editing not out of a spirit of NPOV but to deliberately provoke others and bait them to revert your work I am asking an Admin to address this problem klenk 

Paul you have removed this reference as often as I have added it   It is true that Bill Maher has joked about his sexual relations with Ann Coulter on his TV show I saw the episode myself and Im sure there are plenty of references to it online   There is more than joking about it going on between the two but nothing that can be cited here   I searched the wikipedia policies and could find nothing violated and there are plenty of articles that mention the sex lives of various people   As you didnt try to remove the description of Maher being a friend of hers and as your balanced description of Ann that leaves out her factual distortions you are being clearly POV here
