moreover its necessary to mention hema and rajesh were a hit pair and that song was picturised on them
khanna is in special appearances
genaic keeps claiming everywhere that unconstructive edits have been made by meits a fact that its she by herself making stupid reverts and unexplained reverts
the page itself was created by me  the links have been provided by me  plus vital info that khanna is in special appearance and songs detail etc have been provided by me
