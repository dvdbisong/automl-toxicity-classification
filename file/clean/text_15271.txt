Hayford Peirce reversion 

Hello I see youve reverted changes I made to Hayford Peirce Perhaps youre not aware that four of the red links which I unwikified were for articles written by Hayford Peirce himself that were recently deleted following vfd discussion It seems prudent to unlink the titles of his books in the interest of discouraging further selfpromotion Yes  0059 5 Sep 2004 UTC
