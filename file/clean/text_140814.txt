I think it is relevant The lemonade we have in Brazil is an important drink here So are the drinks in Iran Poland wherever Discussing only the two main kinds of lemonade is an anglocentric I refer to the language attitude They are different drinks with the same name but this name is the only name used here so it is important at least to have a citation I think people from other countries who contributed with the article like me can be offended if they return to the article and do not find what they have written here because its not the same drink Got the point

We can split the article but this attitude can bring the content useless because ex a brazilian will look for lemonade not lemonade juice or something like this

Actually in Brazil the drink you call Lemonade is called Soda or Lemon Soda  27 December 2006
