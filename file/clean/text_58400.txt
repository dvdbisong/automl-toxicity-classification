Simple concept one Crown Realms are equal all Realms share the Crown equally I know its tough for you but try to wrap your mind around it as its quite relevent gbambino 

This is the central point and gbambino is correct   Homeontherange wishes to emphasize the term British Crown as if it is something alien to Canada  This is not surprising as Homeontherange is an avid antiMonarchist proRepublican  Now gbambino and Pter Grey only want to have the usage of the proper terminalogy inserted into the article

The Dominion of Canada its proper name is forbidden here at Wikipedia is a ConstitutiionalMonarchy with a Figure Head of State ie the the Queen  The GovernorGeneral is a FigureHead of FigureHead of State all to preserve tradition  I personally seen nothing wrong with that but then again I am not an  avid antiMonarchist proRepublican
