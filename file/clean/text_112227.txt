The wording that was reverted was as follows


Northern Ireland  Ulster Scots Norlin Airlann is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland2

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a country example The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a province UK example NI example or a region UK example NI example Regardless of the choice of term it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective
 One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities These names can be controversial with the choice often revealing ones political preferences  some refer to Northern Ireland as a province That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists who claim the title province should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of IrelandUlster Leinster Munster and Connacht If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a region Unionists should find that title as acceptable as province Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government  J Whyte and G FitzGerald 1991 Interpreting Northern Ireland Oxford University Press Oxford
 One specific problem  in both general and particular senses  is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself in the general sense it is not a country or a province or a state  although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction but this might change  S Dunn and H Dawson 2000 An Alphabetical Listing of Word Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict Edwin Mellen Press Lampeter
 Next  what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland Province wont do since onethird of the province is on the wrong side of the border State implies more selfdetermination than Northern Ireland has ever had and country or nation are blatantly absurd Colony has overtones that would be resented by both communities and statelet sounds too patronizing though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else so one is left with the unsatisfactory word region  D Murphy 1979 A Place Apart Penguin Books London and it is situated in the northeast of the island of Ireland It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west At the time of the 2001 UK Census its population was 1685000 constituting between a quarter and a third of the islands total population and about 3 of the population of the United Kingdom
