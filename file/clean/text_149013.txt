Some Thirdparty opinions 

Ive been asked to provide a third opinion on recent disputes  Here goes

Do you understand why FileGrand Kudu Eritreajpg was deleted Vetrisimino0  Id like to hear that you do you should after a read of   It seems the deletion was appropriate  And its reversible with permission logged via an CommonsOTRS OTRS ticket
As for the suggestion to   From just reading this page it looked like this had been settled and the photos are to be left in and photos of members of other groups can be added over time and there have been multiple other editors providing opinions already  Good  I would add that images should be shrunk or better yet merged as at FileEriamercoljpg so that this can happen  However I see FileTraditional_Eritrean_dancejpg has replaced Tigrinya Eritrean wedding picture FileEritrea_Eritrean_weddingjpg  Is this a problem  I dont know the ethnicities of the photographed parties  I havent looked through the articles edit history and dont plan do
Flickr has lots more appropriately licensed files  I see FileRashaida_familypng is on the french article so there are photos available 
Re Faytinga photo I think it should stay Re  The mayote site seems to be a mouthpiece for a particular set of politicial views so I dont think its a reliable source for much other than its own views My opinion would be swayed if it had a written factchecking policy  However given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytingas mothers ethnicity it seems reasonable to belive its true  Can you accept that Middayexpress  If not I still think her picture merits inclusion without noting her mothers ethnicity and clutter is a poor argument for its removal here
I do wish to point out that a blanket order to a fellow editor like  is highly inappropriate and invalid here The WPBOLD guideline applies to and allows such edits  However so does the part of BOLD that guides one as to how to react when ones bold edits are not left in place  So in other words both of you should read  review WPBOLD I see no argument for an exception to BOLD

So hopefully both sides will accept my opinions and move on to edit on other topics within and without Eritrea  There are points where I have agreed with each of you and points where I have disagreed with each of you two each and I believe Ive been able to be fair and impartial  Hope that helpstc
