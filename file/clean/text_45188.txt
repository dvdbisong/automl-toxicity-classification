Thanks for the comments I have corrected the Solomons and added Seychelles and Comoros  I deliberatly left out Macau and a number of other countries as I know in the past discussions have taken place as to what is a country and so I decided in the first wave to play safe  If it is a member of the UN then it is a country  I may well mmove on to others later such as Macau Gibralter Vatican City etc but for now this is enough
