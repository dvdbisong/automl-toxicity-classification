 The accusation is the attack and nothing Ive said or done here nor in my recent edit history at the Republican congressmans article referenced above indicates any bias I notice however that the home page of one of the two editors standing sentry over his pet article has dozens of claims of profound liberal bias proudly festooned across the page like a Volvo in Vermont on its way to the Northeast Kingdom One usually finds such committed and messianic people to be deeply wedded to their cause and saturated to the bone with inflexible bias  whether on the left right or third way 
False unsubstantiated accusations blatant bias article ownership and the complete lack of any effort to defend the inclusion of drivel garbage and fluff into the encyclopedia is ridiculous and nothing more has been done by the guards than revert attack and ignore9914124639
