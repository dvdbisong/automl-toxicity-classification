The only major controversy is that on this Wikipedia page the denialists such as Duesberg and his followers those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page and who have had their longdisputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years were being used as the sole source of credible information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it  From the first edit I made I was almost immeditely reversed and edited  Within hours of that first contribution I was being threatened and censored  Ultimately I was blocked charged with violating unknowntome rules of Wikipedia and otherwise censored and rendered unable to contribute  And that gentlemen is what Ive been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia

It would be much better if the Wikipedians with their vast experience of computer knowledge particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page

However I suspect that will not be allowed to happen  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here and based on the news accounts last month on CNN ABC Nightly News and elsewhere which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that Ive been subjected to
