I see this being a nowin situation around here since TenPoundHammer being the one who complained about it and he doesnt want the Canadian Country chart numbers posted anywhere on either in the articles of the singers and groups or the 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 in country music article and everywhere for that matter I kind of liked having the Canadian Country chart numbers posted and seen who was where on the chart but since we have to abide by the rules of Wikipedia and a few members who dont like having something that we can look forward to editing and seeing how singers are faring on the American and Canadian country charts These days people seem to complain about the least little thing and then they make a huge thing about it having to eliminate the Canadian country chart numbers because they have to have a source being complained about by one member of the crowd TPH Makes me wonder what will be next Someone complaining about the American Country Chart
