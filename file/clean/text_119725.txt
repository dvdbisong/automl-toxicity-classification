Something should be mentioned in a new section titled Technical Problems 
Addition of YLOD has been discussed here in the past and the main reason it hasnt been included is that there werent any reliable notable sources discussing it Its mainly talk on forums and on fansites which is original research and therefore cannot be used I dont know if this is still the case but as far as I know the problem hasnt been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot 1UP Gamasutra etc People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users it isnt nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and its notability has therefore not been so strongly established Regarding the firmware update that bricked some consoles This is covered in the PlayStation 3 system software article Chimpanzee    Talk  Contribs 

A huge problem with the video game industry is fanboyism Criticizing a product is basically a declaration of war Anyway the problem is at least known and suggested I found this briefly searching for a reliable source Maybe add a little blurb about it being suggested   

Wait let me get this straight you think we should include a blurb about how high hardware fault rates have been suggested but proven wrong That sounds kinda like a little bit of undue weight to me Every piece of hardware that is ever mass produced has a certain failure rate and unless that failure rate is oddly high like the 360 its not goi
