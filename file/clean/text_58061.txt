You thrice deleted an article I was beginning to build about a published author stating that I could add various info such as biographical detail  It may some day occur to you that this is what I was in the process of doing except that your vandalism destroyed the article within a few moments of creation  I am new to Wikipedia so perhaps there is a complaint mechanism for constraining your behavior that does not involve me deleting you or your creations
