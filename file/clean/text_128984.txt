I found another source this time a scholarly journal that refers to Matrixism On page 105 of Nova Religio The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions Volume 10 Issue 4 ISSN 10926690 print 15418480 electronic Copyright 2007 by The Regents of the University of California Matrixism and its websites URL are listed among eight other esoteric new religions in an article titled Perspective New New Religions Revisiting a Concept by J Gordon Melton

Again I am not sure how to style this citation consistent with Wikipedia standards
