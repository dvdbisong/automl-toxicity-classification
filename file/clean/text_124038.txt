It looks like the various links have been removed now  I would agree that if a balance cannot be established there should be no links to any external sites  That is there are folks on both sides of the debate and everyone has their websites  The antipopper folks have theirs of which you posted one or two ealier this week and the other side has theirs of which I posted a couple this past week  I wish I could find better sites to post but those two are the only ones Ive been able to locate I did not mean to post a commercial site and did not think I was posting a commercial site since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers  In rereading your posts heah I noted that you thought the sites were commercials for poppers I would agree that the second one could be considered such but the allaboutpopperscom site is not If you actually read it which takes a while due to the huge amount of content youll find its not commercial Its a researchbased site which gives us lots of valuable information about the history sociology and other aspects of the nitrite issue

Im glad things have cooled down

Cheers
