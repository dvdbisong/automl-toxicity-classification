I think most of the text of these edits isnt useful for the article A more appropriate version would be a short table listing the specific impulse or exhaust velocity for a variety of engines a reasonable maximum cruising speed and a flight time to Alpha Centauri if the information is included at all A fair bit of the interstellar travel article could stand editing if I find myself with time on my hands I may do a rewrite but for now the current version looks fine
