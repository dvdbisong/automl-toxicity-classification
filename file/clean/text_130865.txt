Tikuko  need your help andor advice We are lacking good breed representatives pictures in Wikimedia library I will load some of mine but there is a lot more  I asked the authors to download some too complicated for them I asked their permission to download their pictures they replied  just take whatever you like  and put wherever you want  I downloaded their pictures and they were removed due to copyright issues Please advice what licence I shall use and how I can download their pictures with their permission in their native languages without copyright infringement Also there are old pictures from old books without copyright of any kind what licence is proper Possibly step by step guide Planning to download several pictures and tag them besides the breed name as aboriginal show Red Star owned born at year  tobet etc so we have a source of cross references 

Thanks
