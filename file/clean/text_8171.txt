Exactly Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song Behind These Hazel Eyes Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it  Belles eyes are little lighter Someone made a video called Behind Belles Hazel Eyes the person who made this video knew what color Belles eyes were and decided to include Belles name in the title And if you read the comments the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like green or hazel they look more hazel than brown or green  yup belles eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved I like the problem solved part With Minotaurgirls bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved

TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her so much so they forbade users from writting what Belles eye color is Notice how Belles name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned Belles name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki This is Minotaurgirls account as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite the reason inserting false information the false information being writting down Belles eyes as brown And now heres Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia Is there any repsite from her

I noticed she has a Live Journal account See what she has written The lack of links speaks for itself She thinks she actually proved Belles eyes are brown depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie like the screenshots she send me By magnifying the images you can see her eyes are hazelcolored and not the same color as her hair at all Notice how shes afriad to use closeups of Belles eye cuz she knows theyll appear hazel if she did so thus disproving her On her blog she didnt mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belles eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didnt She wrote Bleh Kids these days This one needs a hobby Im tired of wasting time trying to undo this snots damage and Im fairly sure the mods of these sites are too Would it be possible to justblock this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners Yup she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobbyless kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl saidbelieves

If anyone deserves to be blocked its Minotaurgirl If it wasnt for her bias sites like like TV Tropes Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldnt have suffered an edit war about Belles eye color The fact that there was never an edit about Belles eye color until Minotaurgirl came along says a lot Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago no edit war about Belles eye color happened there either Its like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belles eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown just cuz she likes to think so not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented Its like someone going around changing Ariels eyes from blue to green just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being greeneyed Thinks dont work like that

My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl I think its safe to say the interent is better off without her Shes toxic shes a nuisance shes talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her she lies she mangles twists and misrepresents other peoples words and she causes edit wars Action needs to be taken against people like this
