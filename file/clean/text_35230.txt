Scarborough Nicknames 

While I dont really want to expand on this section there are in fact some web references to Scompton

You know youre from Scarborugh when
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article I used Clusty search engine to find these references Up to you whether you want to put this reference back I dont care one way or the other

Youre absolutely correct  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning  I found nothing relevant for Scompton but when I redid the search later I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothingPersonally I generally dont see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality  But there is obviously precedent for having it eg Toronto  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries like Hogtown for Toronto but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but dont have particularly wide usage  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps thats just a reflection of public perception but I do believe that it does to a degree give the reader the wrong impression of the place  Frankly I am just waiting for someone to add Scandahar to the list Im not from Scarborough so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified  Given your edits to the article you are probably better placed to make that call than I Cheers
