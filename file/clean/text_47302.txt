I disagree with WPFAITH  Wikipedia only has the right to make demands on what I do on this website not on what I think or believe

Whether you understand the comparison between X and Y is irrelevant  All the groups in the category are the same in that notable sources have accused them of terrorism  That is the only thing that matters  Neither does it matter what pages are on your watchlist  Demanding that any given group be removed from the category but not the others is not acceptable  It doesnt become acceptable if you claim good faith
