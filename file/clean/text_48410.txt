Emphasis of article flawed
I find the emphasis of this article to be pretty flawed The lawsuit itself would not have been notable had it not been for the media coverage and public debate it provoked

The Hornstein Incident is an iconic parable about the perils of contemporary achievotron values and this article in my opinion utterly fails to convey what was reported on and how the story was told in the media Thats important
