This does not seem in keeping with your proposed intent to do bold edits that would be contentious in the actual article I assumed we would look at those bold edits and discuss first but if this is actually a way for Quackguru who has been prohibited from making contentious edits to have edits made by proxy then I suggest scrapping the sandbox What is the purpose of the sandbox if you are just putting QGs edits into the actual article right away Just edit the main article
