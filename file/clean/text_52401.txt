Im not sure if youre familiar with the background to this case but they are somewhat peculiar You can read about the facts of the case in the ANI but Im going to try another approach here Wiki at its foundation is a volunteer project editors need to be selfmotivated or nothing gets done The reason why this drama has been going on for months and months is a small group with no stake in the long run is making all the decisions for the contributors who do This is why of the dozens of regular MMA contributors were part of this at the start but now there are none Think about that for a second We can sit here all day and talk about consensus but the way its been going on in this case is fundamentally wrong

I think the one mistake in the argument above is the assumption this was just like any other wiki consensus with reasonable parties but its very unfortunately not All Im trying to do is make it normal again by diminishing the influence of 3 people whove driven away ALL other contributors in disgust Everyone whos approached it has you have now has been burned This reality wont go away by simply assuming its not there The project is not strengthen by taking a step toward people wholl just take a step back When we assume good faith we do so because we lack the information to make a better determination The abject behavior of these three over many months means we no longer have to assume
