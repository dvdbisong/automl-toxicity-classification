First I would like to start with Zakir Naiks statement regarding Death to Apostates Zakir Naik believes that according to Islam a person who leaves Islam must be executed This is an important viewpoint from a renown Islamic scholar thus this opinion must be included in the article Although this statement was there in the article it was removed by certain editors kept on insisting that the sources were not reliable I would therefore like to list a series of sources that confirm this statement was made Please view     or  to see him saying this live on television You can also get videos of his lectures in IndiaPakistan Various articles have been written on it and there are several web pages discussing it  just to list a few    Thus there is no doubt on the importance of this statement given how thoroughly it has been discussed by people all over India and elsewhere Furthermore since the statement was made on television so I do nor see a problem with reliability of sources Editors who disagree should explain why they disagree before removing related content from the article
