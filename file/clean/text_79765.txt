confess even though I agree with the author that abstance doesnt work this article is very POV toward a liberal side 

Its not POV if its true

Just because there is controversy over a subject does               I LIKE WAFFLES                    not mean that a NPOV gives equal weight to both sides If all or nearly all studies on a subject support one POV as is clearly the case with abstinence see Sex Education  then while we should note that there is a controversy there is no reason not to write the most objectively true statements we can about it

To say abstinence doesnt work is POV In fact studies have suggested that abstinence education does work Abstinence education for example has been successful in Uganda The Family Research Council has a few studies on this issue Sure the FRC is a conservative think tank but that doesnt mean its findings dont have validity or merit  Preceding unsigned comment added by 1542020492   

 Law Section needs work 

The section on laws appears to be complete rubbish  Ive attempted to rewrite it to make sense and be somewhat meaningful but it needs references timeframes etc  Who says that laws like this only reduce teenage pregnancy by 092  When did Texas pass its law  Is it still valid  What does the Texan law state are the punishments for teenteen sex  Give a case history where the punishment was as unequal as this article says  What has been the effect of this law

The original section said something about many goverments states etc trying to pass these laws but they got killed because of something to do with age of concent laws and human rights  Give specifics  Cite a Countryother body and date and preferably leader of government which tried to pass these laws and what happened  Where such laws have been repealed give good examples

Personally Im tempted to remove the whole Laws section pending something more meaningful being written  Id fix the section myself but I dont have any information on what laws have been passed in this regard

 Abstinence section 

The absitnence section is still suffering badly from POV problems both before and after an extensive editing in the last two days  The discussion of the debate about education belongs in Sex education particullarly as this is very UScentric at the moment and there is a section there for that it may be broken out to its own article as well  Ive tried to edit the article on the whole to improve POV but some help is still greatly needed  

Added UKspecific details
Ive added quite a lot of UK stuff to the article perhaps someone from the US could add some more detail about contrasting US policies Ive tried not to touch the bits about the causes of TP so I hope the new stuffs not too POV Ive also deleted some stuff about marriage  I couldnt see what it added  Im really up for doing some more work on this article if someone wants to get in touch to discuss some of the issues   

Under 19
It may seem illogical but teenage pregnancy is only considered as such if the mother is aged 18 or under at the time of conception hence under 19 not under 20  government interventions in the UK and elsewhere take this age bracket as the location of the social problem to which this article refers  Its not a copyediting mistake so Ive reverted the previous change  Im also interested in the comment that the term used to apply to girls under 13 becoming pregnant  Ive never heard it used in this way in the UK could you enlighten me Thanks   

I wish it was 21 I dont think its possible to be ready for parenthood nowadays at that age espeically with the rising cost of living I also think that technically nineTEEN is still a teenager They are also young adults but they are still a teen Most 19 year olds probably wont consider themselves teenagers and THAT is ok but they are technically still thata teen
