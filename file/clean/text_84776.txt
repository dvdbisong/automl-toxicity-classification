unsourced and POV information removed 

I removed a considerable amount of POV OR opinions and uncitedunsourced medical claims from the article 7215415440 chose to revert it stating removing such a significant chunk of the page was too destructive Can we wait for some citations before annihilating all that stuff The answer is absolutely not it wouldnt matter so much if this were an article on dog food or something but you cannot cannot cannot have unsourced uncited and misleading information regarding medicalsafetyhealth matters For a subject as important as this medical advice and claims MUST be properly and responsibly sourced
