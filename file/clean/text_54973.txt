1 in earlier lengthy responses i gave specific instances where sections in this article that are unsourced and thus do not meet wikipedia guidelines instead of removing any of them you and your close collaborator in article edits RolandR who has violent racist activist imagery in his user page choose to remove only the sections that point out pro western bias of rsf for eg among others you remove sentence referring methodology for compiling so called press freedom index as secretive and subjective even though by rsfs own admittance index is based solely on purely subjective responses from unnamed respondents whose selection process is not disclosed ie removed sentence is sourced to rsf factually true and words like secretive were used correctly 2 you do not seems to read what you remove for instance you make references to a phrase link to a government in tour comment above when in fact this phrase is no longer in any of the sections you removed recently 3 you did use bad english argument earlier as a reason for removal when you should have corrected the english instead given all that and more your actions point to a clear double standard instead of addressing why you maintain this factually demonstrated double standard you accuse me of ad hominem arguments this willful disregard for facts and reason as well as your contributions in other artciles demonstrate a rabid  racist agenda on your part  as i said i will continue to expose double standards of editors like you with facts 12323185184
