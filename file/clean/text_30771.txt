 Thanks for the compliment Its true content is my main passion I am happiest when doing lots of content creationediting and community building and I believe I do my best work when happy and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions I tend to go through cycles in my editing Recently theres been a great deal of content creation that interests me so thats what Ive been most focused on A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community When I get less inspired on content I tend to go on Recent changes patrol jump into an XfD or RfA debate etc In my opinion it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content and make brief forays into administrative duties I recognize that some hold differing views to them I would say its essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use other projects like Commons and Wikinews deletion debates mediation etc to act accordingly I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff I have nominated numerous articles for deletion using speedy PROD and AfD procedures I dont know a good way to assess the results but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved I do lots of vandalism reversion and would estimate that I include substed  templates about 80 of the time I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR I participate in CfDs and IfDs Im familiar with lots of criteria like speedy delete I would not claim to know any by rote but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly

 So I would make no promises to be the most productive wielder of the mop but I would make every effort to be wellinformed and judicious in my use I suppose my main use of the tools would to drift over to CategoryAdministrative backlog at the times that I presently look at recent changes and do whatever needs doing   2316 24
