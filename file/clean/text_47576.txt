Why there is an UspenskyUspenski Cathedral in Helsinki 
Hi Girlandajo
You wrote on the talk page of the article on Uspenski Cathedral in Helsinki that There is no explanantion why a church in Helsinki should occupy this generic title There definitely is an explanation Finland and Russia happen to have a common history 18091917 Kindly read my comment on this on the talk page of the article By the way your analysis about Wikipedia
on your user page is thoughtprovoking Cheers
