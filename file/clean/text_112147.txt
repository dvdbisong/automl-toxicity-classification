In regard to this article it looked like a normal biographical article about a television actress to me as opposed to being advertising And her four years in the cast of Daves World suggests to me that she is notable  talk 

 OK  With IMDb the only source it looked like spam to me       

IF Records and Little Nobody
 in re IF Records hist Little Nobody hist  and COI spas Nina phunsta Popstarr69 Shareradar DSK1984
 see also WikipediaArticles for deletionLittle Nobody 2nd nomination

nina phunsta is associated with IF Records so there is a clear conflict of interest 

A Google search for nina phunsta adequately demonstrates the above claim when reading through various posts on forums 
Various forum profiles of nina phunsta contain the IF Records website in their signature This is in contrast to previous claims that Andrez Bergen is a former writing colleague on nina phunstas talk page  

DSK 1984 is harder to pinpoint as it is a relatively newer handle but a Google search presents forum posts mostly related to IF records 

As for the Little Nobody page
  Wayward Seafarers Review Chris Downton 3D World June 2008
This review does not exist on the 3D World website the link is to the homepage of that website There are no other external links under references that can be used to verify any of the text on the Wikipedia page Some of the articles cited are recent so a link to the article on the web version of the newspapers should be provided The ABC artist profile is the only reliable source and is dated from 2003 and refers only to a local dance music scene Many of the links under External Links are broken 

Much of the information appears to be fabricated as it does not appear anywhere else when performing a Google search 
Colloquial language in background information Website TABLittle Nobodys dodgy MySpace site This indicates that the article is largely a puff piece 

Thus articles related to Little Nobody and IF Records should be removed for
1 not meeting notability guidelines and
2 being written in an advertising format
3 large amounts of unverifiable information
  

 1 No admin has denied the speedy yet but although it was tagged 12 or more hours ago neither has anyone deleted it  I agree that its spam and deserves deletion  The problem may be that promotional puffery that it is its been around for so long but that can cut both ways       

 2 Jclemens has since declined dbg11 diff recommending  or AFD  I did a spam cleanup explaining why in my edit summary diff       

 Thank you The broken external links should also be dealt with according to Wikipedia policy and citations requested for the majority of the information posted That should allow administrators to conclude that the page does not meet notability criteria and is unverifiable I will attempt this soon UserWaltonS
