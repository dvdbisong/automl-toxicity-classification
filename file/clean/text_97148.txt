Dear Chris It took me a while to uderstand what happened Finally I came to a conclusion that you exploded see your seen in the above insulting comments which I couldnt find above if you think they are above please quote them because we are just from different cultures Im guessing and correct me if Im wrong that you just dont accept the culture like mine You say where you stand in your own mind with Einstein Landau and Feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools Why do you think that Einstein Landau and Feynman are with me against the world My guess since they all are atheists who dont believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools So we offended your feelings And we are insulting your culture

 If I guessed right and if I did you wont protest since it would be to stand against your God so you have an option not to respond please accept my appologies since I never meant to make fun of your faith I just dont believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth discusses science with a believer I should be taught by experience since BB proponents are always offended by my texts and until now Id never understood the reason before I read Zimbardo that is and learned about deep feelings of those people Deep feelings that atheits like myself dont have and thats why Ive never uderstood them earlier 

 If Im wrong you dont believe that there is a God then I have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis actually considered by me an unscientific but to be PC we cant discuss it anymore So suddenly the discussion became an ideological one Advice to BB folks state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a God and then you wont need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss BB with you Otherwise youll be automatically offended by atheists like Einstein Landau and Feynman since they dont understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have
