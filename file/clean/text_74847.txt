As far as Muslims are concerned any criticism of Islam is hate speech I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics Been there done that myself without even being aware of it It all seemed normal to do Today I find myself on the other side of the fence Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech The Quran is filled with hate speech Look at the article Ali Sina for example that is hate speech The very language is despiteful My every contribution to Islamofascims Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda Both views must be expressed equally Take the example of Sinas page There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar a rabid anti Islamist Islamophobe etc In the paragraph that said Ali Sina is a controversial personality I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sinas fans from those of his foes  This is not to agree with those opinions Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail with all inane and invalid excuses I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important They are just a sample of what people say about him It goes from one extreme to another I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sinas fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject 
Since I joined Wikipedia every contribution I made was removed and reverted and incidentally those who removed them were invariably Muslims Am I not allowed to put the two together and conclude that this is Islamic zealotry at work OceanSplash13Dec 2005 1820
