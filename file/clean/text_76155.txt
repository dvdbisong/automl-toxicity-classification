Hello to begin with nobody works for Wikipedia as it is a volunteer project but I am an adminstrator for the project The problem that we have with the addition of text from nonfree sources even by the copyright holder us that it is difficult to determine whether the person adding the text is who they claim to be or is the original author of the text a further issue is that all edits to Wikipedia must by freely licensed and few commercial or governmental organisations are willing to do this See for example your own assertion of copyright

Please also bear in mind that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and that our content should be written with a neutral dispassionate and scholarly tone Text originally written for corporate promotion almost always needs to be rewritten to be appropriate for an encyclopedia
