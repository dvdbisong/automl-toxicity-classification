Alan Gamble here from Metal Suppliers Online This is day one for me in understanding how to add information to Wikipedia articles

Im spent my career in the field  32 years in all and in 1995 I created wwwsuppliersonlinecom

I personally researched and wrote every word of our property data pages and was interested in finding out how to share this data with Wikipedia in an open source manner

Unfortunately my first clumsy attempt was flagged by you My apologies

Here is a link to some of the property pages Ive created

httpwwwmetalsuppliersonlinecompropertypagesindexasp

Any thoughts on how best to share this
