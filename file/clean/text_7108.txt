No Piotrus I think SSR addition wouldnt be enough In fact I find the issue of prewar partition of Poland hardly relevant here We can assume that the Polish communities would form their distinct attitude towards Nazis and partisans anyway no matter how many years ago Polish state was lost I believe its more about ethnicity and religion However if you insist on mentioning the partition issue two thesises need to be stressed in the text
there were territories previously under Polish and under Soviet rule
those territories were multiethnic at the time not Polish significantly BelarusianUkrainian as well

Ill suggest my text formulation later And I hope these my opinions will be considered when writing new specific articles from Polish perspective
