Removed the central planning nonsense 
Central planning in USSR refers to centrally planned economy as opposed to the free market economy While it may be argued as reason for general economic inefficiency of the USSR during its later years it is completely out of place as a reason for space exploration setbacks in this article First of it was precisely the central planning that made Soviet space program possible Without centrally allocated resources and planned activities it would never see the light of day nor would it be able to compete against a similar space program undertaken by the wealthiest nation on the planet Secondly the US space program or any large technological program Manhattan Project being such an example is equally centrally planned financed and controlled Very little if anything is left to the works of free market forces Similarly the US space program has its own also sadly impressive list of setbacks and disasters Therefore this paragraph should be removed as making no sense whatsoever
