Is it necessary to have this many pictures of NorthPark Center Most major malls have only one picture of the mall and NorthPark Center being not too notable nationwide has 5 Shrek05 1431 26 Jun 2006

While NorthPark may not yet be notable nationwide I dont see any reason not to have the pictures of the mall for this reason  the mall is the largest in Texas at 235 million square feet and one of the five largest in the US according to the International Council of Shopping Centers  Consequently the pictures give readers of Wikipedia a view of how a quarter billion dollars was spent in its recent expansion  With the 14acre Center Park in the middle NorthPark also becomes the only mall in the nation with a sizeable outdoor area for eating playing or relaxing  At one time shortly after its opening by Raymond Nasher the mall also held the distinction of being largest airconditioned building in the entire world
 

 picture rendering under Thunderbird looks all wrong 

The pictures on this page come out all wrong when viewed with Thunderbird Im using ver 1504 under Windows XP  It looks fine in Internet Explorer v 60 same OS  Looking at the page source it seems like more of a problem with Thunderbird or the CSS for same but Im no web developer  Leaving a note here in the hope that someone more skilled might find it and fix it   

 Fountains 

Its been probably a year since I last visited but one of the major interior architectural features has always been the fountain with colored lights and another feature I cant describe well sort of a minipond with a bridge Unusual features worth mentioning very briefly Incidentally having looked at the existing pictures only one of which is at all attractive or unique I think wed do better to find or snap a good picture of the fountains instead Id have to look into whether there are any restrictions on taking pictures I once had problems taking pictures inside a supermarket for my Spanish class they thought I was some sort of corporate spy 

 Lacoste 

If I can afford it its secondary

 Gucci 

Gucci is located in the Galleria and not in NorthPark

It is moving to NorthPark  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

 Major Edit 3262007  Staff Email 

I contacted NorthPark Center staff asking them to release some images of the mall into GNU license since the mall recently underwent construction and could use some new photos  What I got in return was neither photos nor permission but a revised version of the Wikipedia article deemed to be factually correct by their staff  A full copy of the email is provided 

Most of the email has been transplanted into the article with a few exceptions as some parts did not meet Wikipedias standards of notability or NPOV

The biggest omission is the list of stores exclusive to NorthPark  The information does not appear to be notable

The introduction claims NorthPark Center is one of the top five shopping malls in the United States but it appears to be outdated because the List of largest shopping malls in the United States would rank the mall as 7 in the US based on Gross Leasable Area  The infobox has been updated to match up with the International Council of Shopping Centers data rather than the figures currently displayed on NorthPark Centers website

  
Theres still a lot that violates NPoV here I slapped the neutrality tag on it 

 GPS coordinates 

I think the coordinates are 32868594 96773200 for someone who understands the GPS template  Preceding unsigned comment added by 2013268133
