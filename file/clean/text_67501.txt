Hi Jake  My purpose was not to derail the mediation you have in progress as I have no idea what your dispute is about and I am a strong believer in the mediation process when it is appropriate  I used to also have a firm belief in the principle of advocacy right up until I witnessed Aeon1006 turn against the client he promised to help  I wouldnt expect you to do anything differently with respect to this mediation but I think its important that you are aware of Aeon1006s behavior as an supposedadvocate  If you feel that you didnt want to be alerted of this please let me know and I will apologize  Personally I would want to know if the supposedlyneutral person I had agreed to accept mediation from had done with Aeon1006 did
