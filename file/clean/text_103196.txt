I am reading evidence as it comes it and trying to make it more of a discussion of what is going on than a one way evidence dump that the arbs read and act on While questions are directed to a particular editor anyone can answer them Note please do not use this as a place to argue debate or rehash conflicts If you disagree with someones response post your answer Guerillero  Parlez Moi 

Could you please tell where we can answer to you  Is this just below your question or is it somewhere else
