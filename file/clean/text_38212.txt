An excellent question I think a good answer will requiring making a correction to the page Schiffers book says that he Schiffer reformulated Barlows law to state that the current strength varies inversely with the square of the length of the wire I dont see how to reconcile this with the direct quotations of Barlows law that are found in other places like the Report on Mining etc Im guessing that the answer has something to do with Barlows terminology which we should explain in the article Barlows law could not have been about conductance or resistance in the modern sense of the word because that concept wasnt established until Ohms law
