Hello Swapnilwakale and welcome to Wikipedia Thank you for your contributions

I notice that one of the first articles you created was Swapnil wakale which appears to be an article about yourself This is a common mistake made by new Wikipediansas this is an encyclopedia we wouldnt expect to have an article about every contributor Your user page however is a great place to write about yourself making sure to stay within user page guidelines Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit it normally

The page you created about yourself may well be deleted from the encyclopedia If it is deleted and you wish to retrieve its contents dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page

Here are some pages that you might find helpful
