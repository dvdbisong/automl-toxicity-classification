I think trim it back means slash it to a third it is now  taking down a fair bit of what could be considered low note primary supported promotional details I dont see that much unduly promo story writing here to cause such a slash of the story Considering the size of the article and the length of time they worked together five years and the official wrist slap on the wife I dont see much problem with reporting it  my only problem was with the web links  only two  and one only from web archive no longer hosted and the other httpwwwtheglobeandmailcomnewstorontotherapistwhotoldpodcastlistenerstoshuntheirfamiliesreprimandedarticle4846791 not exactly a worldwide link  a local one only  so there is only weak support minimal reporting of the story by other reporters  wiki doesnt want toisnt supposed to become be the primary reporter of the story  so I am in two minds about this story and as wpblp directs caution I am leaning towards taking the story down
