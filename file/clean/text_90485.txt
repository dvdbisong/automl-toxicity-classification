Convoluted sentence 

I read this sentence multiple times and cannot parse it 

After speaking with officers involved with the case in 1986 Frazier called the accident description inaccurate8 and he and others said that thenchief John Polio ordered Bishop released to her mother4222allegedly a political supporter of the chief22 as a member of the Braintree town meeting7 and who they said demanded to meet with Polio personally after the arrest4322instead of being charged for the shooting836

It is too long and the final phrase  instead of being charged for the shooting836 makes little sense in the light of the rest of the sentence Can someone familiar with the story straighten it out
