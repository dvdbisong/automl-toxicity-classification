thank you anon I actually participated in that discussion but the questions Im now concerned about werent addressed at the time What concerns me now is that its a selfpublished paper that relies heavily on hearsay and makes no attempt to source things that are now being extracted from it as if theyre facts The one example I used is of great concern to me but there are others on the Mason Remey and BUPC pages that are also contentious Im curious if its merits are defendable beyond whats been cited above already because it appears to only be a selfpublished paper and should only be used as such IMO
