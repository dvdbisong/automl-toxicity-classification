Possibly Ive reverted the whole lot of them already there were more than the two I first spotted which was boring and possibly unecessary But the problem is that in the absence of an edit summary its impossible for an uninvolved editor to know what is going on so its bound to cause problems If the comments are to be removed they are much better off being struck through with an explanation which is more usual However as there were not multiple sockpuppet comments on any of these AfDs I would argue that even striking through the comments is questionable Being a sockpuppet doesnt necessarily invalidate your comment I understand the reason for the removal but I think its pretty dubious practice Thanks for the info anywayTalk
