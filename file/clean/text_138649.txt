Is the list hurting anything or anybody for being there and how do you define a list as being trivial Its not hard to source all of the videos that YouTube banned from the charts after accusations of spamming they can still be found on the website and if someone want to add a missing video they just found they can do so just remembering to source it and if someone want to check if the views listed are accurate just click the link and find out and either change andor update it Look I really dont want to start an edit war here you must be afraid of a little change to article that may need this list
