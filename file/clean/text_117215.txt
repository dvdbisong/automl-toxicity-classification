Names 

I just watched the first four episodes today and I watch with the subtitles on It was in English I noticed some discrepencies between names in the captions and how they pronounced it and thw names is this article For example

Gusto instead of Gust one can tell they say Gusto too
Meipia instead of Maypia
Bandra instead of Bandora
Neina instead of Neena
Ultranate Metal instead of Alternate Metal pronounced this way as well
Raggu instead of Lagu but what they are saying is the Japanese letter pronounciation that is in between L and R

I think that these names should be changed
