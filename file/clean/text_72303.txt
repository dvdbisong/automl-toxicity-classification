The discussion on the talk page is still heated and I noticed the Salty Boatr responding to a message left for Kenosis  There are a bunch of additions now in between the two  likely because that peson noticed his mistake and wanted to cover it up

Showing that a Message was left for Kenosis

    What is this source Who wrote it It looks like a hodgepodge of blurbs about antifederalists in PA pulled from somewhere but Id be interested to know by whom and from where this stuff was culled As to the article text wrt the Pennsylvania minority presently it reads as follows

        Another nonmilitary usage of the phrase is found in a oneman Pennsylvania minority report published after the ratifying convention cited to Uviller and Merkel who in turn cite to other RSs with selected quotation from the minority report

    At least until this discrepancy is sorted out I would advocate changing the text of that passage to something like

         Another nonmilitary usage of the phrase is found in a Pennsylvania antifederalist minority report published after the states constitutional convention followed by selected quotation from the minority report

    Just to be cautious here Id recommend a citation to Uviller and Merkel and another WPRS representative of the position that the minority consisted of what was it twentysomething participantssigners whether they were in fact part of the convention or not  Kenosis talk 

        Arent you capable of clicking on a link and LOOKING

        I will be deleting all Uviller and Merker material once this article is unprotected as they engage in HISTORICAL REVISIONISM  forbidden by wiki policies  and SLANDER  also forbidden by wikipedia policies96237123191 talk 

and now Salty Boatr responding without the intervbening posts intended to confuse
