Putins annihilation of certain cities has nothing to do with this topic If youre going to make an argument make it relative Political influence of Russia and its military influence are different things The article makes no claim that Germany is a European regional power Turkey also has influences on areas not considered part of the historical middle east such as Turkmenistan Azerbaijan Georgia etc Again exclusively adding a Geographical location to the Term Regional Power for Turkey is nothing but Eurocentric racism Turkey is regionally considered middle Eastern by most countries regardless of including the statement The statement was put there so others wont think that a country like Turkey could possibly have influence on a continent like Europe By adding that one is implying that Turkey isnt good enough to influence Europe even though no one is claiming it does It is also making sure no one assumes Turkey is anything but Middle Eastern There is no knowledge value of including that statement there If youre going to be openly racist thats up to you but dont include it sites like Wikipedia where large amounts of people go to seek knowledge  0715 13 August 2012 EST
