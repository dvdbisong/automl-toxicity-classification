Drosopigiotes in Rochester NY 

Some time back I removed this excerpt from the Drosopigi Florina article

Drosopigiotes Greek Δροσοπηγιώτες represent a population of Greek immigrants who were past inhabitants of the village Drosopigi Florina in Greece At present the city of Rochester has the largest concentration of immigrants and families that trace their roots to the historically significant village Drosopigi This likely includes the following families Dedes Manou Stathopoulos Hantes Marou Harissis and Strembenis  

With it I created a new article named Drosopigiotes in Rochester NY and this was later inserted into the article Rochester New York A user questioned the validity of this claim and it was thus removed

On 28 December 2007  asked if this claim could be verified in some documented form  Since it wasnt my claim originally I wasnt the correct person to defend the comment so I left things as they stood

It just occurred to me that the original claim may have come from you  I wanted you to have the opportunity to comment if you were interested
