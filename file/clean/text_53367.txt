On another point the article includes a quote of Rawats supposedly drawn from his first website

In an article named Journey that he published in his personal website on January 1999 Prem Rawat writes about this apparent contradiction People through the years have tried to place me in a mold and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them When I was very young people were looking for the old silverhaired Guru with flowing white robes I was only eight When people were flocking to India for their search I was in the West When people were looking for sophisticated discourses I spoke of simple things When people wanted nirvana I said You need peace When people said Tell us of the scriptures I said Look within you When people asked What is your qualification I said Judge me by what I offer To this day some people see me the way they want to After all I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are I have evolved but my message stays the same Externally I have changed but within me something stays the same In that same article Rawat states that people wanted to see him as a figurehead and as a leader but that he does not want to be one or the other and that all he wanted to do is speak to those who wanted to hear him and impart the Knowledge to those that sought it He also said that if people like what is given to practice it and if not to leave it14

However the attribution link takes one to Rawats current site instead  If there is no proper attribution here this passage should be deleted no
