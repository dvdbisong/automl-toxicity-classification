What is all this I feel caught in some CSI show I see that someone has been making edits at the library I go to I can assure you I have made only edits I feel are contributing to Wikipedia and I dont appreciate being accused of sockpuppeting In response to Luna Santin I do not always come to the library so I am not always logged in and often times I neglect to log in and simply make an edit along with the fact that I am not the only kid at the library who possibly edits Wikipedia I would guess that this contributes to my blocking and should probably log in every time Unless there is something I can do I will gladly wait out the ban and apologize for any inconveniences
