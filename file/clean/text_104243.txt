Another nonanswer  I dont see any actionable objection or dispute in your bold comments  You should consider changing your approach  If there is something you object or dispute specifically point to it with words indicating how it pertains to the subject of an article or topic on Wikipedia and then provide a proposed alternative working towards a resolution of your own dispute  I cant address a problem I dont see  You say you have a problem  For some reason instead of discussing this problem directly with me youve chosen to talk around it I don operate that way  If theres a problem I either fix it or work towards that result  I dont talk around it
