Gift cards for downloads 
Re As of December 28 2007 it is not possible to use gift cards to purchase MP3s even though the gift card FAQ claims Yes Amazoncom gift cards can be used to buy Amazon MP3 and Unbox downloads   strictly speaking this is a false statement as were able to pay for orders with a gift card at that time  One person already removed that line but it was reverted  Is there a good way to go about providing verification
