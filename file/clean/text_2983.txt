Johann Hari pic 

Hi JacoPlame  The picture of Johann Hari that you agreed to post has now been given the correct copyrightfree status at flickr

It turns out the picture of Hari currently on the article is not actually him I emailed him and he looked at it and informed me of this  see the discussion page so as soon as you could correct it that would be great

Its probably best not to unfreeze the page though There is still no consensus since the user FelixFelix who has in the past inserted libellous falsehoods and the current fake picture into the entry is refusing any offers of a compromise As you can see if you check out the discussion page he has declared that he wants to unilaterally delete any of the critics he disagrees with and wants to quote only the one group he happens to agree with Medialens David r from meth productions
