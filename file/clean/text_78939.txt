How why on earth did you deny the name change request for Billy McKay it not Mckay like the other users say  Lukeno thought Portsmouth had won the Premier League so hes not exactly a good source There is even an article for the surname McKay but funnily enough I dont see an article for the surname Mckay  which is because there is no surname Mckay only McKay or Mackay for the Scottish Do some research on this because this is clearly an abuse of power your attitude is right that one guy is obviously wrong because one source claims McKay to be the incorrect spelling and yet the BBC and other websites say McKay I dont understand why they let user like you dictate what others can and cant do fine for actually vandalism but not when the consensus is wrong and the wrong decision has been given by
