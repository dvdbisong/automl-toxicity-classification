I checked your translation against the French and it looks good to me I would go a step further and suggest that we include the full of text of your translation in the article in a section titled Text of declaration or something similar assuming you dont mind sharing it directly But Im not really familiar with the rules for articles like this so Ill hold off for a third opinion
