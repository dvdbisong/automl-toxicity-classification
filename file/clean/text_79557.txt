Please do not consider my voiding of the discussion page to be vandalism What was written no longer has value because the Theta Nu Epsilon page had previous confusion attached to it Specifically the original author did not understand that the chapter referred to as The Machine is not a legitimate chapter of the organization Once that was clarified many of the comments written way before are no longer valid The discussion page should be deleated and started from fresh now that there is clarification Thank you and Im sorry for any confussion on my part I will clean the discussion page again and please leave it as such so a new appropriate talk page can begin
