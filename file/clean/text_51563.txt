Daryl Gardner the Ute who instructed me on Ute herbal medicine died of lung cancer on August 20 2005  He had lung cancer for over 10 years and used this plant to treat himself  It significantly slowed the progress of the disease until the cancer finally became resistant to its affects  I am unaware of lung cancer victims living 10 years with the disease without requiring advanced treatments which Daryl did not get until about two months before he died  Most people with this disease die within six months
