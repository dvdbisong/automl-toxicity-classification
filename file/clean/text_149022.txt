I appreciate your opinion and that is why I am asking you to justify why we should ignore the sources for alternative names of those people You are right that these people are known as Makedonski Muslimani more accurately  Makedonci Muslimani or Torbeši but there are evidences that there are more alternative names and they arent outdated There is external link in the article which isnt added by me Please look the text in it  Muslims in Macedonia belong to five ethnic groups These are Albanians Turks Roma Muslim Macedonians  also known as Torbeshi Pomaks or Poturs and BosniansA GrecoTurkish Convention on the Obligatory Exchange of Populations in 1923 made some 39000 Muslims mostly Turks but also some Pomaks Torbesileave for Turkey Ortakovski 1997133 Is this text is about the same people or it isnt
The question about the other two names is the same and there is sources from nowadays which proved it The book by Russian author Dmitriy Labauri is from 2008 The term there is Bulgarian Pomaks Through the good finding made by Подпоручикъ we have a reference to Fihret Adanir The term used by him is Bulgarian Muslims Between other references there is a book Поп Антов Христо Спомени Скопje 2006 Pop Antov Hristo Memoires Skopje 2006 The author used consistently the term Pomaks describing these people but the editor Professor Zoran Tododrovski from Republic of Macedonia have not considered it necessary anywhere in the book to explain what that means if the term is ineligible or that this is outdated term
Concerning your claims that these people have been called Bošnjaci in the past can you provide some references It is interesting for me
