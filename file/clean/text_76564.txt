Discussion on linkssources provided 

I think I provided more than enough sources and links that show the Ramdasias are Chamars The sources are books written by british authors 80100 years ago research papers Indian constitution and official government of India websites

If anyone disagrees please post here with valid  reasonable arguments with verifiable links 
Please answer these questions
1 Why would three books see above for links say that Sikh Chamars are known as Ramdasia
2 Why would so many research articles see above for links write that Ramdasia are Sikh Chamar
3 Why do all official Indian Government websites state that Chamar  Ramdasia are the same
