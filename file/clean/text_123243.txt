sneeze volumecitation 

Im skeptical about the claim just added by user 3898875 that the decibel volume of a sneeze is correlated with immune function  I searched medline and google and didnt come up with anything  Can you or anyone provide a reputable source for this  if its indeed widely accepted by the scientific community then it should be easy to find  Otherwise I think it should be removed
