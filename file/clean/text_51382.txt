Facts need to be substantiated by objective reasoning numbers and hard evidence No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts probably from the view point of some American or Western person whos most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry And admixture with whom themselves As ive said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field we may be getting closer and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair while the daughters dont Also the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat sort of rough looking and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa where we originate in Northern Africa and in West Africa whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups Ethiopia is familiar possibly because of the angle of the UV rays like elsewhere Its unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings ie admixture Further the article isnt about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here Unless youre aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth Again who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity which decreases on its way to Eurasia so youd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others including Native American groups who werent even there long enough to become depigmented
