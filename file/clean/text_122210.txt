UserEmmette Hernandez Coleman 

Hi Jack can you please back off this user for a while Ive noted that of the last 5000 edits to TalkMain Page you have precisely two Combine that with your statementthreat to EHC that they would go on your watchlist the fact that your comments appeared in response to a thread EHC started and the unproductive tenor of your comments  well Im sure theres no need for me to start using any alphagettis I can pick out of the soup

If you have ongoing concerns with the editor please bring them to me as it seems I may be better at patient and friendly education At the very least you could try waiting until there is even a hint of evidence of disruption and even then you could still try the ol patientandfriendly Alternatively compile an RFCU or post at a noticeboard asking for sanctions Please dont continue in a course which appears to be application of one man justice Regards
