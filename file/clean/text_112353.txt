Symbols and Designs
I noticed that someone has identified by name and possible reference the symbol on the locker used by Desmond in his underground lair although I did not see it on his uniform However there was also a very unusual design on Desmonds shirt in the stadium running flashback with Jack which Ive screencapped here

Can anyone identify what this is as it was shown repeatedly and clearly in multiple shots while Desmond was holding up Jacks ankle Is it just me or does it seem to be reminiscent of the Anarchopunk symbol such as this one httpwwwahheraldcomimagesnews2004anarchyjpg  Theres even what looks like an A in black on the right of the design turned on its side
