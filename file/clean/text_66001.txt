Im not sure what s thinking is but I think its inappropriate for you to remove that conversation If you had initiated a thread and no one responded I could see your simply withdrawing it but it was an extended conversation with many users commenting including me and it no longer belongs to you Nor is it your Talk page which of course provides you with much greater latitude in the removal of others comments Although I intentionally pinged GW so she could comment here if she wishes Im not real keen on having another extended conversation about the removal of an earlier extended conversation
