Im tagging NewPages and getting some edit conflicts User Excirial talk deleted this article after you started editing it with a reason of G3 Vandalism Its like our own little game Anyway nice job  Â   talk 

 Edit conflicts tend to be positive when tagging pages it kind of confirms that a deletion  tag is placed correctly By the way  am i correct when i think you are placing CSD and maintenance tags manually If so you might want to consider using Twinkle and Friendly for that purpose Those tools tend to be quite a bit faster while also requiring less clicks to place a tag and warn a user   Contact meContribs
