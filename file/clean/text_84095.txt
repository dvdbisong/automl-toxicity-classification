Ordered for Mothers day 

I ordered flowers for Vaughan for May 12 2013 and only just now thought of googling bloomex reviews I now have a sinking feeling
I hope my order is delivered on time and looks as much as possible like it does on the website photo Please deliver it on Mothers day not a day later
