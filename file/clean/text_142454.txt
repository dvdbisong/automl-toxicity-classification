Again the Dom  Rom theory is based on a supposed name connection while there are plenty of such possibilities  of connections with words from the Subcontinent and on a supposed connection between Dombas low status and the antiRomani prejudices Scientifc studies presented reasons for its lack of substance and for the Rajput ancestry Some supporters of Dom  Rom reorganized later their theory by including the points raised against its likeliness by presenting the á¸Œom as a coverterm for itinerant serviceproviding castes and the three group as originating in different areas within India speaking different albeit related Indian languages and probably leaving the Subcontinent at different times taking different routes It is too bad for Y Matras dismissing as always the scientific approach as fantastic politicallyinspired mythology and his opinion based on a mere resemblance of prejudices as the mainstream I presented the evolution in time of the two theories but I see that he deleted most of the scientific results which btw inspired later the supporters of Dom  Rom to make some adjustments in order to keep looking reliable The Wikipedia is based on consensus so you cant have your separate page try it on your userpage Also Im giving you a warning for breaching WP3RR Next time you will revert in 24h it will be likely to receive a block And I want to point out the presumptuos style of addresing of this user
