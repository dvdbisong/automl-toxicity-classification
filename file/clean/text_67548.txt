Likewise Hi You do not want to or are not able to understand the content of my message The FIRST sentence in the lead section states WHO is the person and if needed what heshe is NOTABLE for I therefore remove the word Littleknown which implies an unnecessary qualification that can be added later in the next sentence for instance once more You can develop Asselineaus lack of fame everywhere else but not in the first sentence  So to take in account what you kindly suggest and the word chosen by another user I actually put it in a sentence that follows the first one ie the second sentence of the page although I really think it duplicates the last paragraph of the lead section and really think somebody else will mind  as much as I do and remove the sentence and the word for that matter  I do not disagree with sources and have no opinion about Asselineau Consider this my final reply to you thank you Should you disagree ask for comments of other contributors on the English WP about using the word  Littleknown in the FIRST sentence of a pageAya d
