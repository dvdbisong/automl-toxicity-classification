Ive read through the above and Ive looked up the article in question on the NEJM website  is correct in saying he can make basic calculations without it being considered original research but your calculation is not correct The figures involve the median survival rates not the mean rates and as such simply subtracting one figure from the other produces an inaccurate statistic The median survival rate is simply the middle point between the two extremes  so if one person died after one year and one person died after two years the median survival rate would be 15 years even if 99 of people died after 11 years Therefore your figure implies something that is not the case
The abstract explicitly states the following
This reduction represented a 41month improvement in median survival 258 months in the sipuleucelT group vs 217 months in the placebo group
I think that if the survival advantage was 142 months much more attention would be drawn to this figure rather than the only figure to be highlighted of 41 months Based on this Im going to agree with  Whilst I cant force you to drop the subject I recommend that you stop reverting edits and if you feel it is necessary request further arbitration  in Ã¦nigmate  talk
