Speedy Deletion Nomination

I see that you tagged one of my pages for speedy deletion despite it being of acceptable Wikipedia quality crap but still better then the vast majority on this appalling site It seems that there is a hierarchy at Wikipedia that just shows the high level of discrimination us ordinary users have to put up with The admins use bullying tactics to stop acceptable quality articles such as my latest entry  This must be stopped if Wikipedia is to move forward
