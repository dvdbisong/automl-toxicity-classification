Pandeist 

Greetings You described yourself as Pandeist in the discussion on the images used for God  I too consider myself one How rare a thing I have discovered to meet a fellow Pandeist I feel this has been a fortuitous day as if our Universe has conspired to have us meet 

As you have an interest in this topic perhaps you can translate some of the material from our own Pandeism page to its rather sparse Romanian counterpart Sadly our own article has recently been the recipient of an exclusionist hatchet job which included as part of the harsh medicine imposed the separation of the article into Pandeism and God becomes the Universe But the material in the later article is obviously still about Pandeism and ought to be included in an article honestly addressing that topic Blessings
