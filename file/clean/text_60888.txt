So much missing here on Wikipedia 

I just watched the first episode of the BBCs new series Servants The true story of life below stairs What struck me immediately was that the presenters greatgrandparents had been in service and she likely would have been as well had society not changed I dont think I would have been though more likely hanged or transported for insurrection It reminded me of what motivated me to work on workhouse and the programme briefly mentioned in passing an extraordinary to me anyway magazine called The Servants Magazine which I just had to create an article on  Fatuorum
