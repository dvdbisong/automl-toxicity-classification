Trim and Polish 

On reflection the 19th Century section actually is a bit bloated with nonrelevant stuff The issue of slavery being based on assumed inferiority is obviously core to the controversy but there is also a lot of waffle including arbitrary observations and one guy who merely quoted Herodotus in his dictionary This section is basically the longest in the article and it thus gives undue weight to stuff that is not really core I propose to thin this section down to focus on the controverial issue around slavery Any objections   
Herodotus is in the Classical section and is quoted from Du Bois Regarding the length of that 19th section I have no comments for the moment Actually I see other sections with the same length
