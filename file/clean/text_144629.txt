Let me state a fact if you think Religious violence in India has nothing to do with antiHindu violence then I will move it to Violence by Hindus in India against other ethinicites Then we will debate about what should be here and what should go there If you are disagreeing with the fact that antiHindu violence is real then you should get your facts correct and wikipedia here will not help you unfortunately Google is full of webpages until you subscribe to Ad_hominemAd_hominem_circumstantial common around here then it will be a littler harder to find Haphars theory of what is religious violence and what is not is his own theory and as such he is entitled to have his own opinions POV a wikiaholic would say  while they stay out of the article I am personally entitled to my opinion that his theory is laughably ridiculous  Islamic terrorism  enough said Regarding having found books about religious violence in India who is saying it is not present in India I am saying that no such country exists with two different religions coexisting and no act of violence ever happening Having found books doesnt make it worthy of having an article about it For example Xenophobia in eastern Europe is a well studied phenomena but we dont have an article about it

What it does attain though is a major part in the discussion Your rejection of anything else is incorrect

Anyway every year there is a new crop of trolls and POV pushers and my energy is better spent elsewhere I would just say that Religious violence does not refer to Hindus killing Muslims  it refers to Hindu and Muslims killing each other and the people with local majority winning And that is the fact If you want to put otherwise in the article go ahead and do it Anyone believing that article will be brain dead anywaytalk
