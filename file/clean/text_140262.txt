Hello NickCT  Could you please describe where synthesis is occurring  that is can you show where the article is combining material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources Could you please describe what you think is a violation of WPPOV WPCOATRACK is an essay not a policy so COATRACK issues are a matter of personal opinion not of policy
A few points regarding deletion
 There are several books journal articles chapters of bioethics textbooks etc that have been written specifically on the topic of this article unethical nonconsensual andor illegal medical experiments in the US They clearly separate this topic from that of human subject research in the United States in general
 There exist articles for several other nations that are similar to this one such as Nazi human experimentation North Korean human experimentation Japanese human experimentation They exist for the same reason that this one should exist  numerous highquality reliable sources have identified these topics as worthy of study in themselves
 A wide array of reliable sources have identified this articles topic as worthy of standing alone as an object of analysis separate from the broader history of human subject research in general Per WPNOTABLE that means that the topic of this article is worth of its own article Just because many of the experiments in this article are things that most people would consider bad which is why most medical ethics textbooks generally use them as illustrations of bad science does not mean that it is biased to have an article on them WPNPOV does not say that articles cant be about bad things It says that we should neutrally report what reliable sources have to say about things regardless of our moralethical views on them This article neutrally reports what medical ethics texts and histories of this topic have to say about it I am not aware of anywhere in the article where it is not neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying 
That said like all articles this article is an incomplete work in progress so there are certainly issues Rather than merely citing policy without reference to this article please make specific suggestions for how to improve this article
