RE El Arsenal

Hi Beardo
Your rationale for my having removed El Arsenal is misguided  although understandable My reasoning was that I couldnt find any information linking the actual site of El Arsenal to the site where the Palmer Shipyards are today I looked for several hours online but couldnt make heads or tails of it If you can verify put that reference back in by all means  I just couldnt verify it in any wayshape or form  its a tough one on account of the fact that were talking about a centuriesold location I just wanted to make sure that it was 100 percent true Actually Zeitlen might have some insite on this  he assisted me a great deal in how to provide sources sources etc 

Take care
GabrielFoto
