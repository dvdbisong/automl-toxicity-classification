Re Please advise 

Hello Mareklug Well I believe that your request at WPRFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article by the way thats how we call it we dont block articles we protect them If the edit war continues then do relist your request at WPRFPP It will likely to be accepted I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes when in the face of your opponent Tocino Edit warring is never a good choice as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikelydraconian measure youre not causing that much trouble as far as I see My suggestion is when Tocino or any other user makes an edit that you strongly disagree with refrain from reverting right away and instead summon the other party to the talk page Then two things may happen either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view or he doesnt join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrators intervention against his unilateral actions I hope this helps Best regards nd
