Second of all youre not actually listening to what Im saying compressing your own posts is fine but please dont remove other peoples posts when you do so Thats why Im currently reverting your changes  youll note that I put your other comment back afterward but it was impossible to put all those other comments and keep your compression at the same time so I reverted it Understand  

I have deleted 1 posting now

I must provide a phone number to a local mental hospital

Are you in agreement with the deletion As you can see it doesnt address my content suggestion for the article Being the FBI claiming there is no relationship between 911 and Osama The mental hospital comment is nonsense IMHO If you can give me a good reason to keep it please let me hear

I dont find this talk page an appropriate place to slander other posters You should at least agree with that no

Please explain if its not a nonsense comment Also address the FBI topic as this is the main gist of my concern please dont whirl around it

Thank you
