Please provide diffs of where I engaged in persistant incivility and agressive personal attacks after final warning Thanks An unfair unblock You cant even say it right But at least someone acknowledges that I was improperly blocked Too bad its not noted in my block log and that Rd232 was never asked or inclined ot apologize Or asked not to edit war Or asked to refrain from blocking where hes involved Or told to stop smearing me with false attacks You want a personal attack Spartaz Read my mind about what I think of your intellect and competence as an editor
