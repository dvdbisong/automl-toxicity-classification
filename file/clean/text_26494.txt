Please dont do that 

Hi Fleetham

I just got a new job and dont have time to constantly monitor the Bitcoin page any more Much appreciated if when youre considering making an edit if you can think back to whether youve attempted to do that edit previously and try to recall what the outcome and feedback was that time For example why in the holy heck would you alphabetize subsections of an article We went through this once before Sure maybe if theres a list of things then alphabetize them but subsections are not a list

Thanks
