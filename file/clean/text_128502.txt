Im Back

Well at last Im back to being able to use Wikipedia and this time I aint going NOWHERE D Now for my first action I will address many of the fighter pages that I created that were deleted within the two weeks I was away Now there were only really four pages that I was really shocked about seeing deleted which were Tim Newman Reagan Penn Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick as they all match Wikipedias MMA notability criteria 
Tim Newman has already fought for BAMMA to two occasions which were BAMMA 4 and BAMMA 5 and he is scheduled to fight on the BAMMA 8 card all of which have links supporting this So even thought he has only technically fought for BAMMA twice because he is clearly a true member of the BAMMA roster and unless something happens to him which means he cannot compete at BAMMA 8 I find that deleting his Wikipedia page was a massive error for everyone who participated in that debate 
With Reagan Penn he doesnt necessary need the sympathy factor for being BJ Penn as he is currently competing for ProElite which as we know is a second tier MMA organisation as they were the same people who have created EliteXC and everyone agrees that with the attention ProElite are getting now that they are a second tier organisation so that means that the only thing Penn is missing is a thrid fight under them and telling by how excited ProElite are having a Penn fighting for them Id imagine that he will get another fight for them possibly for the next card so that means that deleting his Wikipedia card can be seen as being premature as if he decided to retire after his second bout then fair enough but he hasnt so far so once again another blunder for those who participated in that debate 
Finally we have Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick Now these two guys have competed for Cage Rage and Cage Rage UK both second tier organisations They both fought on the main cards of Cage Rage on one or two occasions and competed for the contender cards at least three times each which means they were already deserving of their positions on here They are always competing on the main cards of Cage Rage UK which again means that the still deserve their spots on here So for another blunder I would like to see all FOUR men have their pages reinstated as soon as possible as Im beginning to suspect that something is not right with the legitimacy of the users who I will keep anonymous so I dont get accused of personal attacks again who are calling for many pages of mine to be deleted which also includes the deleting of the Cage Rage UKUCMMA Wikipedia page as this orgainisation is one of the big three in the United Kingdom along side BAMMA and Cage Warriors So if anyone would like to help me I want to have these problems to be fully investigated and would like to see a real result on here Thank you for reading
