Its kind of a moot point  Another point is that as long as we are getting into particulars naturopathic medicine is NOT a medical system  Allopathy Osteopathy Chiropractic even TCM are medical systems  Naturopathy is a mixture of other medical systems but not its own system  For purposes of law a naturopath should have a separate license or certification for every medical system employed  So for example if allopathic blood tests or pharmaceuticals are used then a license in Allopathic is needed  The license specifies that kind of practitioner for that type of practice  TCM and Chiropractic are licensed in the same way  Naturopathic doctors seem to be requesting an all inclusive license to practice any kind of medical system that they want  Naturopaths do specifically have homeopathy as a medical system however homeopathy is nonsense and everybody knows it  You would all do yourselves a HUGE favor if you got rid of that one practice  Dont bother sending over the studies  Ive already seen them and if you dont understand what is wrong with those studies then you just proved my point about naturopathic students not coming from serious research programs  Another thing to keep in mind is that we all know that the medical establishment has problems but that doesnt prove that naturopathy is effective  This is a basic logic equation  Those two things are mutually eclusive  The medical establishment doesnt work because of all of the periferal garbage that keeps practitioners from being effective at what they do and not because the medical system itself is ineffective  Western medicine if highly effective when it is allowed to work unencombered  Another thought about naturopathy is that you should take some notes from the TCM people  They want TCM tested by western scientific standards and the result has been that thier system of medicine has proven itself effective  In areas where it has been proven ineffective they are happy to acknowledge it as ineffective  If Naturopathy did the same then homeopathy would out of the picture almost immediately  The difference is that TCM practitioners know that thiers is founded in a belief system that over time has become an effective medical practice and where belief will no longer suffice they are happy to scrap it  The result TCM practitioners are licensed at the masters level and the final stages of the OMD degree with full licensing nationwide is well underway with support from the medical establishment  In fact they will have this licensing while you guys will still be insisting that homeopathy works  Whats worse is that you guys have been in practice for much longer than TCM has even been in the US  Something to think about  You have to answer the problem of not having a unique naturopathic system to test as well  Therein lies the problem of being in a position of requesting an all encompassing license to practice anything and everything  The practice has to be defined properly to be licensed and must be disinguishable from other practices  It cannot simply be a combination of parts from other licensed practices
