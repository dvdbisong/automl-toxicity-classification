Thank you nice translation  About evolutionism as a scientific belief I understand it is a unavoidable fact as it is broadly recognised that any human activity does assume some supporting set of beliefs although scientists claim their set is the most credible one Anyway I find this first proposed paragraph not very NPOV balanced for we all may discuss it and easier now as the rest of the edition is posted below I think to have kept all the contents Some few evident additions were intentional Please discuss The first paragraph is the one already turned into real English
