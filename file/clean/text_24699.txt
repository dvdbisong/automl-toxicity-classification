The source you provided does not support the assertion that USC kids are spoiled snotty snobs  The article merely instructs the reader to hate the Trojans and gives a reason that they are spoiled and snotty  Again if you find evidence that USC students are snobs ie a published study that measure students on a validated scale of snottiness that would be admissable as a verifiable fact  The only thing you could do with the article you provided would be to say that The Daily Bruin has accused USC students of being spoiled snotty snobs perhaps as part of an discussion about USC vs UCLA rivalry  Your example is noparallel  On the other hand Riverside and the 909 is definitely associated with trailer trash cows and hicks  there is no question about it  If it is true and verifiable I dont see how you can object to its inclusion
