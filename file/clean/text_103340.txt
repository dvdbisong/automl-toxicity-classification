Creativity through the results of Hallucinogens and Delirium 

I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the concept and belief of creativity through the effects of drugs and states of usual consciousness This is debateable but Ive heard that the creator of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll was under the state of opium induced results Im hoping someone could perhaps write a section in relation to this if it is indeed in relation with the article Thanks
