Regarding your deletion of  Kirsten Price musician 

Hi a user came by on my talk page requesting I drop the createprotection on Kirsten Price musician so they can move an article there probably Kirsten price musician I was a bit confused by the situation here it looks like you deleted the article as a G3Vandalism and then placed the createprotection on it stating that it was repeatedly recreated that was the only deletion that I had seen are there other names that I should be looking at Im confused why the G3 it was probably more under advertising considering the account that created it was Kirsten Price Music Just wanted to touch base if its ok go ahead and let me know its ok or just do it for the requester otherwise let me know what Im missing Thanks
