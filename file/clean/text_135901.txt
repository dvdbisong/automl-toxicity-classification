Whoooops 

Sorry about that  the picture was mine so I gfdled it  For some reason I thought that this process was automatic now  I quess this is what i get for thinking  i get to be wrong        again     though you might have to remove the big RED thing on the picture
 PS I posted apicture earlier at Samuel Cashwan of Cashwan  On the picture page I explained my process but perhaps it should be labeled fair use   I suspect that you understand these things better than I do   

 Thanks a lot for your help

ReImageJOSE BUSCAGLIA GUILLERMETYjpg

Thank you for bringing the issue to my attention  The image was a Press Release and not public domain as you pointed out  I guess I pushed the wrong button you know those things do happen  I made the applicable change Have a nice day  

 Re Images and fair use 

That made a lot of sense Thanks for the info वरत 
Ok if I added the same image in the Mahabharata article and described the scene to the images caption would it still be a copyright violation वरत 
Ive found the painting on many sites        This shows that the image is not restricted to one organisation or person This one doesnt seem to have any such copyright law How about changing the tag to fairuseinMahabharata I dont have much knowledge about the copyright laws so I need some guidance here Tx वरत
