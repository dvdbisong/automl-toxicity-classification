Youre mostly correct in that false statements if correctly quoted can still be printed in here However Ive seen some exceptions to that Gore Vidal defamed William F Buckley in Esquire Magazine and Buckley not only successfully sued Vidal but the magazine as well I dont think that anything in this article has crossed the line but obviously more responses by Savage should be in this article How do I prove that Savage said something BTW All of Savages quotes that I put in this article are things that Ive heard him say but how can I prove that he said it I have to find a source who has transcribed Savages statements What if the source is incorrect That doesnt matter So logically speaking I could have my own website and print statements by Savage and then cite my own website as a source in this article
