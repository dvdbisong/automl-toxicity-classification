Better luck next time  It did degenerate into quite a foodfight there didnt it  Its sad that there is this repeated conflict between proleft and proIsrael  The whole enemy of my enemy thing gets really messed up when there is common cause between progressives and nazis  A very sad state of affairs  I suppose I have it easier  I may disagree with many of the actions of the state of Israel with respect to Palestinian issues but as the grandson of a Nazi I dont feel I have the right to publicly criticise them  It isnt quite holocaust guilt  its more a matter of if I accept the legacy of my grandfather then I accept some measure of responsibility for his actions  Anyway it seems pointless to get into fights with people like Slim when there are so many more deserving people to get into fights with  

Anyway keep up the god work  One thing though  you might want to moderate what you say about private email conversationsit sounds like you plan to be offesive and more importantly it just sounds too much like the tiff between Sam Spade and Felonious Monk  BTW feel free to ignore everything I say I dont really have a clue about anything   1441 6 Apr 2005 UTC
