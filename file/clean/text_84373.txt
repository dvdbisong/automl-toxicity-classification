SOPHIAN it is not Spencer Wells website as such It is just an old National Geographic webpage He probably had next to nothing to do with that selection of text which I believe was copied from 10 year old text which FT DNA used to use when DE and E and EM35 were all still new concepts It is silly to say let him change his site if he has appeared in public and explained himself clearly The internet is full of old information If you really think everyone is being unfair then please go and defend your case here httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaReliable_sourcesNoticeboard
