Please sign to agree to formal mediation 
I have filled out a request for formal mediation after Mattisse rejected Blueboars attempts The link for the request in here  Each party in this case PalaceGuard and Mattisse is required to sign near the end of the form and then fill out their general issues You dont need to inundate the mediator with issues that are already discussed on the Talk pages and the request must first be accepted
