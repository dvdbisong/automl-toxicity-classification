Thats simple you have placed a possible copyright warning upon that page  I do not know why you did that  Personally I am not sure that the information is subject to sopyright due to it being placed on a wiki site  therefore the copyright if there is one could belong to several users  since it is freely edited can there be a copyright

Having read the information on the Lostpedia site I found this text
The license Wikipedia uses grants free access to our content in the same sense as free software is licensed freely This principle is known as copyleft That is to say Wikipedia content can be copied modified and redistributed so long as the new version grants the same freedoms to others and acknowledges the authors of the Wikipedia article used a direct link back to the article satisfies our author credit requirement Wikipedia articles therefore will remain free forever and can be used by anybody subject to certain restrictions most of which serve to ensure that freedom

To fulfill the above goals the text contained in Wikipedia is licensed to the public under the GNU Free Documentation License GFDL The full text of this license is at WikipediaText of the GNU Free Documentation License

Since the text used on that site is licensed to the public  Wikipedia content can be copied modified and redistributed so long as the new version grants the same freedoms to others I feel that just placing a link to the original article at the bottom of the page would remedy this  Agreed
