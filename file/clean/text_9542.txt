Gilles Tr√©hin

I have listed this article at WPDRV for possible undeletion based on information I have received regarding a book that has been written by Trehin about his fictional city Urville  Interested parties should contribute to the discussion  

Is this still deserving of featured article status

Im beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles  It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article  This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia  Instead it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it  The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling  I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks  Im not looking for an argument  Im simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article
