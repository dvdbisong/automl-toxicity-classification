My inquiry is friendly in a civility sense I am not personally challenging you rather I am challenging you as a coeditor and collaborator  That is what I meant when I wrote I challenge you to do this per WPV WPV in a nutshell Material challenged or likely to be challenged and all quotations must be attributed to a reliable published source

Please do not perceive my challenge as personally threatening it not intended so  Civil order at Wikipeidia exists between editors with different points of view in large part because we all agree to follow WPPOL  Could you therefore please answer my questions  Thanks
