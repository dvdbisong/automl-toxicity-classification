WikipediaWikiethics 

Hi

We started a proposal WikipediaWikiethics to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal

Unfortunately a proporn and prooffense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote simply because the policy is not ready It is not even written completely 

Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal started another poll Do we really need a poll at this stage at the same time The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now A NO vote on this Do we really need a poll now poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further 

If you have concerns about the ethics and editorial standards in Wiki please visit the page WikipediaWikiethics with your suggestions on the policy We have two subpages Arguments and Sections You might want to consider reviewing these pages as well

Thanks in advance
