My best advice to you is to give it up it isnt worth it You cant win when arguing with someone who is respected by the community For some reason some users on here are given a gold star and therefore allowed to do what they want and they usually have admins that they regularly go to when they have problems Kinda like a pimp 
You can argue until you are blue in the face and whether you are right or wrong you are gonna be the one who gets disciplined I know cause it happened to me Personally I find it highly disturbing that a user can remove your edits simply by saying it doesnt meet with the consensus opinion when usually that opinion is only that of said user but apparently there is no way to get an impartial judgement Basically he will be allowed to threaten you with all sorts of actions like claiming your sources are not reliable watching and editing every article you touchwhich is incidently happening to me now reporting you blocking you and if you respond in any way that he considers insulting you will be blocked Its not fair I know but welcome to wikipedia LIGHT DINAMITE 1747
