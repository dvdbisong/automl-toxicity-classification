Requested move 

Waldemar Matuška    Since this is an English website names of the articlespersons should be in English per MOSFOREIGN  WPENGLISH The current Matushka is definitely violating rules above Even terms like Seiyū or Чайковский are transliterated into English as Voice actor and Tchaikovsky therefore I dont see a reason why czechs should have this special kind of   treatment
