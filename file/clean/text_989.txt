Perhaps overlooked in the discussion of Steve Moores credentials is another aspect of the Newsweek article By saying that Knoxs supporters have hurt her by expressing their opinions Nadeau has effectively stated that the decisions of the Italian court will be or have been influenced by anger and antiAmerican sentiment rather than the evidence alone I dont know if Nadeaus experience in Italy qualifies her to make such an assessment but taking her as a RS to make that statement would be as great an insult to Italian jurisprudence as anything Knoxs supporters have said I wholly concur with pablos opinion that the piece has no place in the article
