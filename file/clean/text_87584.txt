A bit late in revisiting this but as a result of this discussion and Wordreaders experiment thanks Ive clarified the following
open hand form  open hand appearance when ripe 
closed hand form  closed hand appearance when unripe
I think that the benefit of this is that it uses the more precise word appearance and clarifies the reason for the differing appearance
