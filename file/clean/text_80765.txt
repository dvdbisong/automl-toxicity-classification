Removal from AntiSemetic category
Mel Gibson is Only Human
While Mr Gibson did make wrong antisemetic comments he did so drunk and he does not speak openly about any kind of antisemetic views when sober He also does not advocate his views or pursues them past a drunken rant I think he needs to be removed from wikipedias AntiSemetic category What do you guys think
 

Hes an adult The law doesnt make a distinction betwen words  acts said and committed when drunk and when sober neither should we He is quoted on a police report as making remarks that are undeniably anti semitic Therefore he is antisemitic  
Like all material here just provide sources saying that Gibson is antisemetic and you can add it in Thanks 
Umm the NYT quotes him as making comments about the fucking jews Is this not a sufficient source for you  
In which case this little ditty from the article also seems to helpa prominent jewish leader calling him an antisemite In response Abraham Foxman of the AntiDefamation League who was one of The Passions most vocal critics released a statement saying that Gibsons apology was unremorseful and insufficient and that the group hoped that Hollywood now would realize the bigot in their midst and that they will distance themselves from this antiSemite 
Gibson said that he has disgraced himself and his family and he is sorry for what he did What more do does Foxman want Yes and hollywood has such high standards to hold upthis is the kind of ammunition Foxman craved as soon as he started criticizing the Passion Im not antisemetic in anyway and Gibson SHOULD be ashamed I just dont like people being unfair I also think the mugshot is unfair and I will be changing it 
I agree that the mugshot may be unfair as a primary image for this article but it should be included near the discussion of this incident  

The ADL has been sued for defamation for unfairly accusing people of antiSemitism before and has been mired in a number of controversies I would hardly consider them a reliable source  
Yeah like George Bush might get drunk and suddenly shout out I love Islam because when youre drunk you typically say the opposite of what you believe  

Its funny to read the arguments here about if Mr Gibson is antiSemitic or not given the known views of his Traditionalist Catholic church Clearly he is antiSemitic and in another time he would probably say so proudly Call a spade a spade if it quacks its a duck Mel Gibson is antiSemitic Can there really be any question among intelligent people And if this is so than clearly it has a place in the article  
Please dont insult us with your damned sneering arrogance Jake B  Or some of us may argue that there is no question amongst intelligent people that many Israelis and rightleaning Jews amongst the diaspora are racists and gentile haters who campaign in a McCarthyist style just look at the reaction to this case  utterly hysterical  I tell you what I can provide more evidence to support my assertion than you can to support yours cf ADL And by the way according to the ADL every single gentile in the world who isnt an Israel supporter is a Jew hater and racist who should be condemned and ostracised so quoting one of the leaders is like quoting Hitler in an article on Jews  Many gentiles see the ADL as nasty racist and very dangerous  And by the way compare Gibsons comments with some of those posted by Jews on the Haaretz online forums hes positively liberal compared to them I quote from recent posts  9999 of Arabs are terrorists does this one sound familiarlets just nuke them all and stop wasting our soldiers livesyou cant trust Muslims to hold to peaceMel Gibson is a Nazietc etc ad infinitum plus hundreds of comments saying the civilians of the Qana massacre got what they deserved  Try posting a comment there in which you ask for Israel to be calm not overreact and spare civilians  without actually taking a side  and quickly and inevitably youll be called a Jewhater a
