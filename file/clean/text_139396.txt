For exemple a RfM takes often months to be accepted takes too much time and when it is concluded it lacks means to enforce decitions My experience with it ended up being quite painful where 2 years were lost with the same issues still being unsolved This ends up being frustrating to serios goodwill editors not to mention possible scholars who certainly dont want to loose time with editors gaming the system and no one to enforce policies and decitions
