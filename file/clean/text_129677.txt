His previous full lupine state allowed him to lift only 1 ton  Sabreooth can lift at least 900 lbs  He is also a skilled martial artist meaning that unless the Werewolf was as strong as Luke Cages original strength classification of 3 tons making him several times stronger than before the writer and editor would have not had Sabretootj so easily handled  However despite this king werewolf thing the name comes from an issue of Dr Strange he was much stronger than Sabretooth but still not able to over power Hyde who is 50 tons  

Any fan of the character would know that this is inconsistant on Marvels behalf and would note thast his strength enhancement is unspecified and ranges somewhere between Sabretooth who was even stronger then than his 1st few appearances a Hyde as per their battles
