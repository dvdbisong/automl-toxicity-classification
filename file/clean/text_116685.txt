Help with Hellcom Article 

After through extensive searching on Google for Hellcom Ive stumbled upon something that youve written

You replied on the talk page that from my perspective you wrote the whole thing And because of that I ask of your help in fixing the Hellcom article Ive visited the site itself and Ive also done a bit of reasearch myself in order to improve the article
If you dont mind at all could you help me in the process Im having a tough time just trying the delete the unimportant sections and sentances and citing sources for much of the article
If not Id just like to ask for tips on how to improve it
Thanks for reading _   contact
