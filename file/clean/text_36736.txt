It seems like infoboxes are standard in articles about theatres  I moved the images around  does that help at all  Can anyone compress the info in the infobox so that there is not so much white space between lines of text   ALSO what about the last image at the bottom of the article  It doesnt look like anything to me and I suggest deleting it  Does anyone agree
