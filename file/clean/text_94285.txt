 Railways of the West Coast of Tasmania and Rail Transport in Tasmania 
Thanks for drawing my attention to these pages As you have seen I have attempted to clean them up and add a few references They are still far from perfect but certainly better 
  

 Rotting mounds of  

We had a big blow from the South the other week the beaches were covered in it I suppose we should get it out before I get too interested in gnamma cygnis insignis 
I was just looking at the illos in the book you cite they were my original inspiration for the arts and draft on my page I did hope to find some additional refs for the largest etc but we can kick it off  me thinks cygnis insignis 
Ill be grateful if you start it off Coastline or coast cygnis insignis  Yeah we can always play with that later i think  i hope Suro 
 whee  heres anuther No G yet or any other sort I dived into water without my floaties cygnis insignis 
Florabase has a feature on Marine plants of Western Australia maybe the starting point should be there Unless I can adequately focus my draft will have to remain so There are any number of things to be resolved cygnis insignis 
The flowery plants would be a minute part of them Better check w Hesp on the cate for biota by place cygnis insignis 
I am under the impression that seagrasses are the only truly marine plants Everything else either isnt really marine eg mangroves are essentially terrestrial or isnt really a plant eg seaweeds are algae Although come to think of it the latest thinking has the Chlorophyta amongst the Plantae But leaving aside the navel gazing if I can Ill try I say that marine plants and seagrasses are essentially synonymous and personally I prefer the latter term Hesperian 
 I was going to say proper plants but httpflorabasecalmwagovaumarineplants were fast and loose includes both marine angiosperms and a variety of marine macroalgae cygnis insignis 
Gosh they havent got far its a sea of red links  Hesperian 
They is they Hesperian

 Anglican Diocese of Perth 
What on earth are you referring to in your comments on my edits in this article  Your accusations of OR or POV are ridiculous  they certainly are no more so than the comment I edited  My experience of the Diocese of Perth and Anglican churchmanship differences is more than adequate to edit this article appropriately
