Furthermore I am accused of making personal attacks This refers to a comment I placed about a user on the talk page of the entry a user with an IP address as an identity The user has been disruptive ignoring discussion on the talk page and reverting legitimate goodfaith edits without explanation The comment I placed was not in any way a personal attack

I would like to point out that I have been at pains to explain at length every element of my position on this entry I believe the entry has suffered from editors who do not quite understand some important points and who are inclined to introduce controversy and original resesarch into an entry about a living person My intention has been to improve the entry
