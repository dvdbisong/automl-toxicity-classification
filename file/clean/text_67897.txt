Featured article status 

Heya I came across your profile and saw the bit that part of your contributions involve working on articles up to featured article status Is the 2006 state election important enough to be considered for featured article status and if so what improvements do you reckon it might need to be up to scratch quality wise Thanks for your time much appreciated
