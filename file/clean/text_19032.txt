Thanks for the reply I completely understand and agree with your reason I have never used findagrave as a research tool nor would I ever But in this case it and findadeathcom another site that irks me and the facebook page of the woman who started the campaign for the marker are the only sources featuring the photograph And as I mentioned since findagrave is already used in the article I think it would be okay to use here again I have recived a video and more photos of the marker and it is indeed in the EntwistleRoss family plot Anyway Ill work on an encyclopedic entry and if you say it needs more or less I am flexible Thanks
