 Basically  the initial warning was thisThe other two he marked above are warnings on removing the first warning a number of times on the pretext that Admins have agreed implying that admins have agreed that it is right to say SOCK ARMY  considering that the editor has repeatedly been asked not to use confrontational language Wikipedia is not a battlefield and comment on content and not the editor  at the time of that remark he was still on a block for inciviltyUse of such language is not civil and remindful that he has not mend his waysI could have been wrong to assume and that is why I asked him to seek an admins views before removing but he blanks out the warning saying he only unrendered the warning  in turn I got rewarded by this on my user page 

Revertwarring is bad If a user does something wrong posting one warning generally does the job There is no need to repeat it again as it only exacerbates the situation Instead leave an edit summary with the word Warning and report it to the admin who comes to the concerned user talk page  Nearly Headless Nick L 14
