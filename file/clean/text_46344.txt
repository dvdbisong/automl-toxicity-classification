This incident has been reported to the Biographies of living personsNoticeboard  Here I simply note that the thrust of Vabio1s argument is the claim that the facts supported by the biased campaign website citations are true  VaBio1 urges readers to verify them for themselves ie do original research  This is contrary to Wikipedia policy
