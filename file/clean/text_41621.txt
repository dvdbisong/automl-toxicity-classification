I agree we could do better and the ideal situation is one where we have images like those from a textbook We dont have that yet though In the meantime why not keep one image that does in fact demonstrate vomit in real life If it really is questionable whether it actually is vomit then the discussion is another entirely I dont see the rationale for removing something just because it could be done in another and more tastefulbetter way A bad image of a pancake would not just be removed unless it had extremely bad photographic quality it would be kept until a better image of pancakes was available I dont see how vomit should be any different
