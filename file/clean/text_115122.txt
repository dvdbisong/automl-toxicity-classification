Victoria Cross  NZ VC etc thefts 

Hi Woody While I agree that what was there needed improvement Im not altogether sure that what you have put there solves all the problems
It said Lord Ashcroft contributed significantly to this amount You replaced that with significantly paid for by Lord Ashcroft
Im not very sure what significantly paid for actually means
The original implies that Ashcroft didnt pay ALL of the reward If one removes significantly from your change one is left with paid for by Lord Ashcroft Thats not the same Im not sure what your addition of significantly was meant to mean Further Im not sure what the addition of significantly actually does mean
What was wrong with Lord Ashcroft contributed significantly to this amount that lead you to change it
It said New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of the reward You removed as a result of the reward Why
It said A high profile Auckland lawyer Chris Comeskey played a key part in the drawn out negotiations to safely return the medals You removed that sentence Why
Several versions ago you reverted it to say While there has been much public debate about the need to offer reward money in order to retrieve the medals there is universal relief that they have been safely returned Yes the tenses needed changing but now it just says There was much public debate about the need to offer reward money in order to retrieve the medals This reader feels that it now seems unfinished 
Cheers
