Well that Kiko himself said it my dear jdegi is not a proof of anything
He has been caught several times redhanded sexing up his figures
We had already this discussion about Loreto meeting
I showed you a report from a reliable source  korazym  httpwwwkorazymorgnews1aspId25057 
that quite shows this
In hisher report a correspondent who attended the event after praising the Neocatechumenal way meaning the source was not biased at allcouldnt help but notice
that the actual number of youth who responded to Kikos call
was much less than the one given by Kiko himself one third o the original figures

About a groupmovement you cannot report only the figures given by the group itself which are prone to propaganda you have to try to
crosscheck them when you do that with the Neocatechumenal way you sometimes get nice surprises
