Incorrect Abbreviations Vandalism Warning 

 Bender176 kindly do not delete my message without first replying or updating the Abbreviations page 

Bender176 I am on a shared IP address This is the first time Ive edited any Wikipedia page I am referring to the Abbreviations page httpenwikipediaorgwikiAbbreviationUnited_States The section regarding Dr Gale Stephens and Lana Verkuil is obviously vandalism itself I removed it and restored the original section to what it had been prevandalism Please either advise me why you marked my action as vandalism or restore the page to its prevandalism form Thank you

PS  I probably should add that I am not the above individual you have been attempting to prevent from vandalizing Wikipedia This IP is at a college so there are many students faculty etc all under the same IP address

PPS  I notice you can add custom text explaining why a change was made How do you access that option

PPPS  I would appreciate it if you quit deleting this  It is quite frustrating  I am attempting to help Wikipedia fight vandalism and youre preventing that
