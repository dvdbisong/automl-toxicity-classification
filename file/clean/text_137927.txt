My signature and your actions   

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing but I couldnt be fucked  So Im just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy  

You stated when you blocked me anon only account creation blocked with an expiry time of indefinite personal attack in signature  will unblock on signature change   I disagree with your action on three levels  The first is that it was a personal attack the second on the indefinite ban and the third on any action at all  

 Why it wasnt a personal attack 
The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm From WPBP  Of the list of reasons on WPBP the only one plausibly applicable is Disruption  Under this it has 

A user may be blocked when hisher conduct severely disrupts the project  hisher conduct is inconsistent with a civil collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia

And Blocks for general incivility are controversial
In no way could any of my actions be considered severely disruptive  Or even simply disruptive  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil and I disagree more later blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first  So from WPBP there is no reason in my opinion to block  

Now we examine WPNPA  This is simply Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia and I agree with it  The point here is personal  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone  It was a generalised comment and an in joke I cant help it if you are not in on the joke  For the attack to be personal you would need to find someone who was attacked you would not be able to do this  

So my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits thus it should not be a factor in anything  

As to general incivility I simply disagree  From WPCIVIL Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress  My signature was not personally targeted behavior as explained above and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of conflict or stress  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely you violated WPBP which states 

Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban In all other cases they should be handled with appropriate timelimited blocks or arbitration Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users whether individual IPs or IP ranges in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users

In blocking me at all I also feel that you violated WPBP  You did not have a clear reason to block me and you did so indefinitely  In these cases you should have posted at WPANI asking for advice andor detailing why you felt that the block was needed

 What could have happened 
So what could you have done  Well the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated see the previous case for an example  If you had have done this and I had agreed with your argument then I would have simply changed my signature  If I had failed to change my signature then you could have discussed it with me more andor taken it to a hearing   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning I didnt want to take this to a hearing  However I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so and I reserve the right to do so  This by the way is simply a statement  

What would I like you to do  Well an apology would be nice perhaps something worded along the lines of Im sorry for not talking to you first not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you  

If you are unable to give an apology for whatever reason say you believe that you were in the right and still are then I would appreciate a comment regardless  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster but here would be fine as well
