Forgetting about the indepth meaning of the verse 34 in Islam
From httpsenwikipediaorgwikiAnNisa_34
In the Quran verse 34 of Surah anNisa abbreviated as 434 concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husbands wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives1

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original and all vary to some extent 2Some Muslims such as Islamic feminist groups argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence3 However some have translated beat as separate as Arabic in its nature is a multimeaning language and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning4

Ibn Abbas a companion of Muhammad wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap5 When asked about the light hitting he said it refers to using a siwak toothbrush There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it6 Furthermore Muhammad commented on this verse where he said a light tap that leaves no mark7
