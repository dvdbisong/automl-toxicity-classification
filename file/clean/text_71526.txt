According to the Internet Movie Database the Lost in Space episode War of the Robots came out on February 9 1966 and credits Robby the Robot as a robotoid and William Bramley and Ollie OToole as uncredited robotoid voice actors A fansite Character Studies Analysis by Charles Mento claims Robot Robby knows the term Robotoid 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment describes the episode as The familys robot is seemingly replaced when Will repairs a robotoid from an advanced civilization  until the new machine wreaks havoc by trying to take over the ship

 And in April 1968 Marvel Comics released Avengers 51 which introduced The Robotoid

Obviously Beter didnt coin the term but I think all of these references should be listed as being notable
