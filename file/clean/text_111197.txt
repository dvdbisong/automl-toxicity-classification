Completely faulty map 

The map image that goes with this page is riddled with errors Most notably India is coloured while there has never even been an attempt in India to make voting compulsory Mexico has been coloured red compulsory voting enforced when both the text of the page and independent sources CIA fact file for instance can confirm that compulsory voting is not enforced in Mexico It is likely that these are not the only errors in the map
