What do you mean theres no single author for the article In the past my info has been deleted by ONE person who claimed to be the author of the article This doesnt make sense I think you mistake author for administrator I believe this means one and the same Also I did make much effort in discussing with the administrator or author about this matter but I used another name He just doesnt listen at all Hes stubborn and discriminatory Can you contact him about this so that he doesnt thwart my efforts in contributing to that article Id appreciate it alot
