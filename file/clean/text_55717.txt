Emergency 

Hi there  I know you have shown an interest in the debate as to whether Emergency should be an article or a dab page  I have now created an article which I believe would be suitable for the Emergency page with everything else to be moved out to a separate disambiguation page  My suggested article is  in my name space and the debate as to whether this will be suitable is on the Talkemergency page  I would appreciate you input
