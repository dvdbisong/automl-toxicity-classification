This article is now considerably less lame than a month ago However the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians which appears uncertain and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity Lets be real Israel is the occupying force here and has far far greater military might not to speak of economic power The Palestinians are virtually mendicants Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality Israel is armed to the teeth backed by the even more powerful USA and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads 

Your antiIsrael political rant is of no help here If you cant be productive then why are you here Please do not start a fight 

I would like to see the material in this article merged back into the parent article under the section The Peace Process If that section becomes too long it then can be spun out in a separate article such as The IsraeliPalestine Peace Process The information serves little purpose in its current isolation

By an amazing coincidence the material about Faisal in this article contains an identical selection of quotes as  Choice of this many quotes from a single interview involves a creative act and is therefore copyrightable Material removed as a possible copyright infringement  2258 10 Jan 2004 UTC

Absolutely false This article contains nowhere near enough material to count as a copyright violation This issue has been discussed before Our limited quoting is well within US Copyright fair use allowances In fact for nonprofit works we have considerable more leeway than forprofit works Again you are censoring quotes for political purposes As discussed above your censorship is not acceptable  1438 Jan 11 2004 UTC

 Selection of quotes is copyrightable The GFDL means that content has to be free for all our sublicensees not just us However we can simply link to that article which is what Ive done  1500 11 Jan 2004 UTC
