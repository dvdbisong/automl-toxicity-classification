Dori I appreciate your relatively objective assessment too Of course Sareks statement above is inaccurate the quoted statements were never made nor represent facts Company apologists want to say things in the article without supporting it with sources  Then they want to delete wellsourced statements they dont want the article to include Several people said they questioned the notability and fwiw one of the founder pages Sage_Weil was deleted The sourcing of the article is significantly improved since I got involved as looking at the edit history shows Procompany COI editing has long been a problem there   

outdent Was it appropriate in your opinion for Sarek to relocate comments at the AfD Although he moved some of his incidentally some of the first personally critical comments he also left some of Scjesseys similarly critical comments in place as well as making it impossible to follow
