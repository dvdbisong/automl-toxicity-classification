I wouldnt worry about it if I were you You read my contributions and you concluded that I intend to lie for Jesus Thats too funny and too ironic Not surprising given your user name that youd make such a blunder Given all the research on religiosity and IQ But Id be more concerned about you lying for Jesus than I would be about me A quick look at your contribs would all but confirm that youve been lying for Jesus for quite a while now Any who my username is fine its not a violation of any policy just because you think its blasphemy Pretty funny of you to bring this up though I LOLd a bit then threw up a bit in my mouth because of the hypocrisy and irony HAGO Saint Anselm
