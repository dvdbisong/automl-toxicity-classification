Depends what you consider nu metal bands  Please make a list   

 I thought there already was one

On the List of Nu metal musical groups only Korn and Kittie overlap and I didnt even add Kittie to the Alternative metal list someone else did  All others that overlap are filed under InstigatorsProgenators which means they arent nu metal artists   

 Pretty much all of them on the list are correct However the insigators were simply some of the first Nu Metal bands Ive listed them below

 Deftones
 Fear Factory
 Godsmack
 Korn
 Rage Against the Machine
 System of a Down

 They are all Nu Metal bands If there is a Alternative Metal genre it needs defining as exactly what it is Gothic metals and symphonic metals Sound Constructs and Lyrics sections make for good templates for writing down what a genre consists of 

 I dont want to delete this article if it can be kept as a lot of editers have put good work into this But if its essentially Nu Metal it needs to be merged If needs be it can be mentioned on the Nu Metal article in the same way GothicDoom is mentioned in the gothic metal article
