You started it with BullShit about Fetzer having a POV expressed You are not Neutral and clearly your United States Marine Corps colors your opinion and exposes your motive for censorship but none of that is relevant to the idea that the article is about the group itself and not about What others think about the group As a contributor I have found the most adequate definition of the group and included it 

You are acting silly It is like if you dont agree with a groups message you think it is ok to redefine the group for anyone looking for information about who the group is I dont like the KKK but I am not editing the Wiki article to make it more Black Friendly or Negative about them I would even cite their founder as a  definitive source for who they are because that is the OBJECTIVE thing to do 

Semper Fi yourself into some common sense
