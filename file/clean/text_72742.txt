With regard to TV channel O2TV text this looks like a standard CV that Kashin  possibly wrote himself and provided in the place of his employment At least it is completely unclear who wrote this text no name no date no selfexplaining title If it was a newspaper article published by someone else with name and telling that Kashin is great that would qualify If he published a book one should include this book in the article So far I do not see any proofs of his notability in this article
