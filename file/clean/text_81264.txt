 Disagree Her parents may have lived elsewhere at some point either before or after her birth but multiple sources already used in the article even list the address of the house she was born in  in Hampstead Garden Suburb which is neither Golders Green nor Hampstead but another London suburb Clearly London alone is vague Thats like saying New York without specifying which borough Or saying Los Angeles when you mean Santa Monica Burbank or Malibu It does make a difference Seems to me that if we are not specific were just inviting endless debate from editors who will want that specificity We have the correct info now Best to just use it and leave it Thanks   2104
