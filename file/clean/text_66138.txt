Sexist jokes are not appropriate 

This joke was sexist and not terribly funny  Youve been warned before about being civil and constructive in your comments at the Reference Desk that post was an extraordinarily ugly and illjudged step backwards  If I see anything like it from you again I will block you talk 
I dont actually believe Medeis is female because women dont act like that Sorry if the joke was too subtle for you  Whats up Doc carrots
