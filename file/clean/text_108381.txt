I get what youre saying but being born in HK I would have to formally disagree with your stance on using Simplified as the unified script That being said I know both Simplified and Traditional as well as both Pinyin and Zhuyin so you cant say that I have bias For the time being until some form of unification REALLY takes place I would advise respecting the scripts of nonSimplified users so that 1 they will be able to read it as well many but not all Traditional learners do not bother learning Simplified and vice versa and 2 we dont have arguments on which script is better Sounds good
