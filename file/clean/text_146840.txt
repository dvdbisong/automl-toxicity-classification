Fan Criticism
I think I may remove the entire Fan Criticism section It has no references and incorrect Im nowhere near a hardcore SG1 fan and I know its wrong I saw one of those season opening specials on SciFi regarding the production of the show and the creators of the show credited their major creative tool as being having the protagonists the Stargate team of the US military unintentionally causing the major problems that spark a galaxy wide danger and throughout the show they try to fix mistakes theyve made That would be the exact opposite of the US being a Mary Sue in the show
