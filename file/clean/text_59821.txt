ERROR However only 5 percent of the money the consumer spends goes into purchasing carbon offsets The other 995 percent goes to the bank  The rest goes to the bank only if you forget that theyre actually paying it on net of 23 merchant fees to the people that actually sold you the stuff  Blatantly incorrect so Im fixing it too bad most WP citations are to random stuff on the Internet
