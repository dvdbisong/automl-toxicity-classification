edit conflict  Andrew thanks for that thorough overview  Unless there were a relapse I think that the most severe problems with this article have been solved   The lesser problems fall under 3 and I see the possible routes to resolving them as being my more dramatic route through 2 or for someone with more patience than myself such as you with your calm thorough patient approach to work on 3 directly  I think that in view of all of the above especially that the problems are no longer that severe  Im going to slip into a less active role here though I would certainly comment in a few areas where it might be helpful or jump in if any bullies return  Sincerely North8000
