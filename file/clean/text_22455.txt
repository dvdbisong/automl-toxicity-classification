Concerning sources only from certain published astrologers and for Nonneutral point of view attitude in the traits area 

1 Many areas of this article do not represent a worldwide point of view do not forget that astrologers may differ in their interpretation

There are some legitimate sources from some Westerntype astrologers like Goodman for example but these astrologers do not represent all the Worldwide astrological community It would be better if there were additions from even more legititate astrologers from all over the world and not only from certain known Western ones 

2 In the traits area there is clearly a tendency for NonNpov attitude were only positive traits have added there in a overwhelming and exaggerating manner and almost no negative traits at all Aquarius have negative traits too but it seems the editor that added the latest traits had picked only positive traits and did not added the negative ones for his personal reasons
