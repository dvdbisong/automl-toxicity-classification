Well cardcheat is a characterization while pro gambler is not its a term stating a persons line of work There is no moral judgement in describing someone as a pro gambler I would think calling someone in Wikipedia a crook or a cheat should only be acceptable if that someone has been convicted in a court of law eg G Gordon Liddy is a convicted felon But O J Simpson is not a murderer Ill look this up in WP
