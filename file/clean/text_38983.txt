Explanation 

My revdeleted comment was a badtempered response to a deliberately needling statement from someone who has a bit of history when it comes to doling out such statements I explained this when contacted by  on Sunday in my message to him at 1032 UTC I emphasised that my words were figurative and in the context of what had been said by the other contributor I also asked Philippe to reassure that contributor of various things including that I know nothing about them that I neither have nor have access to any weapons beyond the sort of thing usually found in a UK home and that there was no intent to do anything in particular except leave in utter frustration of the bad faith etc flying around I assume that message had been passed on by around 1955 UTC latest which is when Philippe replied to me

I havent looked at Wikipedia since that badtempered retort and would not have looked at it now if it were not for someone asking me to post some sort of comment Im not reading through the stuff above nor looking at the ANI thread that Im told was opened

Until certain things happen some onwiki and some involving an issue that the WMF are looking at offwiki Im gone from here Im pretty sure that those certain things will happen but I doubt that they will do so soon and it may be that I decide not to return anyway Frankly  and I know this will seem arrogant  that would be Wikipedias loss not mine 

Ifwhen I do return Ill be notifying quite a few people that I would rather they stayed away from my talk page which is something Ive always been reluctant to do in the past Im fed up of lynch mobs and gangs here so anything that helps to reduce the baiting is A Good Thing As a rule of thumb if youve baited  in the past you can assume that youll be on the list because although often I do not publicly support him that seems to be the common denominator among those who bait me The gang can go elsewhere while I hope that Eric and myself will continue to agreeagree to differ as and when appropriate and in an adult manner We can get on with improving content the baiters can carry on doing whatever it is they want to do elsewhere

My thanks to everyone who has contacted me It was just a badtempered response Im perfectly happy in life if slightly miffed at the increased distances Im having to travel due to some unfortunate Wikirelated events
