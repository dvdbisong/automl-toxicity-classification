Youre welcome to your opinion but NPOV requires that we give due weight to all views Just because you personally disagree with someones published statements doesnt mean we ignore them Lets imagine for a moment that all Greensleaning editors suddenly left Wikipedia to oh I dunno go clean up beaches of plastic litter on remote islands with no internet Would we then ignore the Greens involvement in Australian politics Or would we follow policy and report on an evenhanded basis Surely you must see that Wikipedia must reflect reality not some personal opinions no matter ho strongly held
