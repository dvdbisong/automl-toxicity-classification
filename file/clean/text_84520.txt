Please answer my questions It will help clarify exactly where any issue may be
Also please note that there was a change in the layout of the table There are contradictions and I have supplied secondary sources for those I considered that needed them If there are specific cases that you consider need clarification please note them here I have removed the direct comparison of tropes in the table so as to discourage the eisegesis performed by Ross Nixon
I did not forget the but only with care clause This is an inappropriate POV accusation of yours It has nothing to do with either reading the text or the table It seems to be similar to that of Ross Nixon who talks of harmonization rather than what is actually written which is the aim of the table Until you actually see what is written you wont read it for what it says Then you can harmonize if you need to but the desire for harmonization is POV Harmonization is an interpretative act upon the primary sources and that would need secondary sources
You havent explained your claim that every cell needs to have a reference from a secondary source Can you give a specific examples with some explanation of cells that need references from secondary sources You have not been able to communicate what your specific issues are so I fear your lack of specificity is endemic of a lack of substantial complaint  control
