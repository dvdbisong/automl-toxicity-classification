I generally agree with Dr Blofeld here  My own view which I think I may have never expressed out loud before is that it is no longer wise or useful to restrict DYK links on the front page to new articles  At one time this may have been a good way to incentivize people to write new articles on interesting topics now it may be leading to unnecessary recentism as well as limiting the scope of what ought to be one of our most amazing and charming front page features  People including me love did you know tidbits that are interesting and surprising  so why should we restrict ourselves to selecting just from new articles  And since I havent commented yet although my views are well known I think using the Daily Mail as a source for fluff is a really bad idea always  There are rare cases where the Daily Mail and similar tabloids are acceptable for use in an encyclopedic context but every use should be placed under the strictest possible scrutiny
