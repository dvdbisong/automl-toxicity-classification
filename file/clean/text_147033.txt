Im sorry but you have a history of taking the counter position on everything I say or do no matter how big or small so your opinion doesnt carry any weight  I dont say this to be disrespectful but when you cry wolf at every small thing you lose credibility and influence so Im simply unmoved when you disagree with me because you always disagree with me  I do believe if I said the sky was blue you would argue that it is really blue grey because of the cirrus clouds  Im not interested in your twisting of words    2       Join WER
