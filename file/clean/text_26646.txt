The Quick Count Conteo Rapido as opposed to the PREP Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares was a statistical sampling model of several polling places It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction The results from the Quick Count which were made public some days later showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside It was because of this as per prior agreement that the IFE declared the race too close to call the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results or declare the race too close to call The Quick Count was not the PREP As it happens the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results

The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE There is no statistical component to the PREP as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results
