Objection to proposed for deletion
I have removed the proposed for deletion tag that Eeekster placed on the article I have just looked at this editors Wikipedia user page and then it says he is from the United States So this editor would not be familiar with any of Tinchy Stryders new songs as he does not release any music in the USA This article should be kept due to the likelyhood of this single being a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom if his single releases history has anything to do with it The single gets release tomorrow on Sunday 6 November 2011 on iTunes United Kingdom The same situation happened with Tinchy Stryders previous single Spaceship see that articles talk page for the proposed deletion of the song to be deleted When the single Spaceship was released it charted at 5 on the UK Singles Charts and the music video for the song won Best Vide music award at the 2011 MOBO Awards I wouldnt bet against this Off the Recordsingle doing the same  thing as the previous single Spaceship if not better
