My point is that contrary to certain media outlets using the term for commercial advantage as well as fans of RFC 1872 clinging to a fiction the Club never really died the term Old Firm can only be in existence when both Clubs the term was used to describe are also both in existence Here we even have the current THE RFC 2012 head of media communications describing how RFC 1872 did in fact die whilst making the comment No matter how Charles Green attempts to dress it up a newco equals a new club When the CVA was thrown out Rangers as we know them died httpwwwdailyrecordcouksportfootballjamestraynorsplwillnotbeable1129166 Some of other media outlets also describe how RFC 1872 died httpwwwdailyrecordcouksportfootballrangersincrisisproud140yearhistory1129262 httpwwwtelegraphcouksportfootballteamsrangers9376332RangersFCincrisishowthefallofagiantunfoldedhtml httpwwwmirrorcouksportfootballnewsrangersfootballclubwillbeliquidatedwithmassive879518 httpwwwheraldscotlandcomnewshomenewsairofunrealityas140yearsofhistoryisformallyendedinlessthannineminutes17876625 httpwwwheraldscotlandcomnewshomenewsrangersfootballclubborn1872died2012x17860493 The whole point of this Old Firm page should allow fopr this information to be displayed because you know fine well that people outside the fanbase of RFC 1872 DO NOT RECOGNISE the term Old Firm because of the liquidation event It is not unreasonable to suggest it should be in there to make people aware of the reality
