The only one I know much about is French Tarot but I think the other games are similar French Tarot is much like other tricktaking games the tricks are won by the highest card in the suit or if trumps are played by the highest trump card There is bidding with the highest bidder becoming the taker the taker wins the hand if he or she gets enough card points as determined by a thoroughly insane point system tc
