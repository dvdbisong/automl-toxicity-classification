Vandalizing the Macedonian towns 

Glenn first of all the Freestylefrappe is not TERSELY saying he has already blocked me without any warning Have you seen his version of Kumanovo article He is talking only about murdering blood terrorism and nothing about the city normal life Of course there were moments in the Kumanovos history when a terrorist attacks took place but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesnt deserve such descriptions  It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Pauls catedral Westminster Tower bridge and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground Talking about copyvios I noticed that FreeStyleFrappe is using text written by Christopher Deliso You can check that on

Are you sure he has permit for doing that Of course I will not stay calm until he stops vandalizing the Macedonian towns
