Distortion of sources by by lowering the number of casualties from 6000 to 35 in the Gemlik Yalova massacres

 questions all sources which he doesnt like on the other hand he adds retaliates without hesitation weak sourced massacres with large numberscommitted by Turks against Greeks in the List of massacres in Turkey See See This already proves his unreliable POV behaviour eagerly adding without questioning the source info that Turks massacred Greeks but insisting and denying that Turks were massacred by Greeks Btw I dont deny any sourced massacre regardless of the perpetrators and victims

From the moment I made this article Alexikoua started to disrupt the article he is WPIDLI from the beginning very biased he tried to deny it than shift the blame to others and finally lowering the death toll from 6000 to 35 by distorting this source page which does not state that the total killed were 35 it states
Of the total 177 people in a refugee camp in Istanbul responding to a Ottoman questionnaire 28 individuals responded that they had family members harmed during the Greek occupation In total only 35 were reported to be killed wounded beaten or missing This is in line with the observations of Toynbee declared that one to two murders were sufficient in driving away the population of a given village

He misuses this source and claims the total number killed during the events was 35 I explained to himagain that in individual cases the number already exceeds 35
Furthermore Toynbee states that in one single  village called Hayriye Khairie half of the population was killed according to a Ottoman document it had 250 inhabitants at another village called Akk√∂y Akkeu 60 people were killed so the death toll of two villages has already exceeded 100 Furthermore the source never states that 35 is the total number of people killed in the peninsula It is only the result of a questionnaire to 177 people Furthermore Toynbee states that there were no large scale massacres in one specific region not in other areas his words are again distorted

But Alexikoua still insists on distorting the source I explained it countless times he still insists here here here  here here and here

He also amateurishly did original research to deny sourced content See here he ignores all other sources and insists on saying Toynbees account about 35 as a total number of reported casualties is the only we have so far Which in fact is a lie because it is not Toynbees account but from the Ottoman questionnaire of 177 people
