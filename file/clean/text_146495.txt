lord Shiva for Featured article 
I just see many important features relating to the topic was missing including a small description and link to Maha Shivaratri        I would like to give my points hereUndoubtedly lord Shiva is linked to all sections and regions of the Indian societyThere are great works relating to lord Shiva in many languages Remember he is pre vedic god immensely popular among tribes later on included in the Vedas If the page depicts what is in popular culture it will be a great source and the page should become Featured Article I feel there is discrimination of users writing from Tamil  Malayalam  Kannada even Hindi perspective Sanskrit has its own credits it is unique and as the name suggests it is well written I have written 4 articles on them But it gets defamed by wrong promoters who make it mess up with other languages  claiming other linguistic works My article was edited because i mentioned the name of the god in Tamil Those who deleted them know whether Sanskrit and Tamil both used same script once before Sanskrit stuck to Devanagari script 

UserRedtigerxyzRedtigerxyz  Talk   TalkInclude Malayalam scripture works on Ayyappa please dont completely ignore them I will give more details for my writings with explanations on sources later for your views Shiva is linked deeply in Kannada Maratha and Telugu traditions too but very less representations in the page And when it comes to lord shiva and muruga you just cannot ignore Tamil if you have developed hat redness for the language  Include details what is popular among different peoples rather than quoting just Vedas 

 can you please give your views
