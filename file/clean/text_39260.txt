from wordIQ definition Holocaust denial is the claim that the mainstream historical version of the Holocaust is either highly exaggerated or completely falsified  Bali and his cohorts have claimed repeatedly that the mainstream historical version of Holocaust history being covered in this article on the New York Times and the Holcaust is false or exaggerated and they have denied including authortative facts figures and quotes from the New York Times itself from the directors of the Holocaust museum and the Wyman Center for Holocaust studies  you may disagree with my use of this term but it is a use about which reasonable people may differ  i am not going to apologize for using it  the apology is owed to me for being abused for speaking out for the truth about Holocaust history  the fact that bali admits he has been called a holocaust denier before should be an absolute red flag this is not an accusation people make for no reason i have too much respect for Holocaust history to do that  something the administrators at Wiki evidently lack you should all be ashamed of yourselves  this is a scandal  cimicifugia
