Balance

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory  To introduce Badoglios career by saying he was an Italian soldier politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign Due to postwar expediencies however he was never brought to justice seems to miss several points entirely  Thats 5 words about his military and political career and 36 about his activities as a war criminal  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence  If this war criminal accusation is true it needs to be strengthened with names dates and places and some evidence of Badoglios involvement in the events  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italys most senior military figures during the Second World War despite his doubts about Italys strategic capabilities and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini  Badoglios role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943 when Italys future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula is the most fascinating thing about his career  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively Badoglios inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war  This article in its present form barely mentions those events
