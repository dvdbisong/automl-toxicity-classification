Well it looks like you others who have an account added the rat factoid what with it explaining the ending  Scorpion as to your last edit of Dominik about changing the line to the rat what was meant was that the last line of this episode referes to the symbolisism of the rat in the last scene of the film I cant edit anything so hopefully you folks can solve this yourself  And Dominik per your own hypothetical scenario if in fifty years from now someone does watch the episode wouldnt they be confused as to the last moment  Its not a question of explaining a joke its a question of elucidating an unclear ending  The former can be superfluous the latter is necessary

Finally and this is towards Ctjf83 and Momusufan I freely admit that I am no expert about the bureaucratic nature of and rules of this site  But Im guessing double standards wrongful accusations and automatic mistrust goes against the spirit and the letter of the rules here  This is why I asked an administrator to look at the situation in regards to the rules and whether I or you overstepped any of them and any suggestions of way to rectify this matter and was not as you falsely imply to give an opinion about the inclusion of the line itself  This is all moot since this fact is now in the article despite your vociferous attempts to block it  In all likelyhood were I a registered user this would have never been an issue and my edit would have remained  Its quite a hypocritical paradox that anonymous users who are more ignorant of the requirements in editing an article are held to a higher standard than those users familiar with them  But then Im guessing that in the encyclopedia anyone can edit which represents the sum of human knowledge it is not acceptable and you two for whatever personal reasons chose to ignore those very concepts that you clame to profess and want others to follow721222140
