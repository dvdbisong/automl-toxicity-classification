Those are model derived fields  2 meters just is a rounded measurement of the usual height temperaturemoisture is measured near ground level 15 meters  Just think of it as the temperature and relative humidity you see reported on the news  Models themselves still dont have a good handle of 2 meter temperature which is why MOS model output statistics still exist  10 meters is just the standard height of wind measurement  When you hear on the news that the wind is south at 10 mph it is at the 10 meter 33 foot level  Sorry about the delay in the response
