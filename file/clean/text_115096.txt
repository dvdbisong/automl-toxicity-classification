Anglican Church of the Americas 

Hi JohnI have a query for you I cant make heads or tails of all these Americans and their strange denominations and I ran into this club which appears to be affiliated with the regular Anglican church but presumably with a difference Theyre also known as The Church of the Alpha and the Omega and you know the more words in the name the smaller the church and seem to be basedeither the whole church or just the AlphaOmega onein Luverne Alabama But theres also churches in South America and plenty of missionary activity see this which is hard to do I guess from Luverne Anyway I cant figure out exactly what they are Google Books has little to offer and I dont have access to the Encyclopedia of American religions another suggestion of smallness What I want to do is write the article for Michael Simmons the archbishop but archbishop of what but maybe you can help me write the article for the ACA along the way Thanks in advance for whatever you can do for me Oh Im going to ask another editor from the Anglican project as well I hope you dont mind that Ill point the here so I dont have to copy and paste which would really hurt my reputation for originality Thanks
