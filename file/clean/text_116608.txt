Cheers Sir Sputnik That was very helpful Its a shame as I spent an hour creating that page As you may have gathered from my user page I take a keen interest in lower league football teams No offence to you but I think this system is ridiculous No matter how lesser known a footballer is creating a page for them nevertheless benefits Wikipedia The state of the lower league footballer pages on here is currently appalling and if pages like mine keep being deleted Wikipedia is going nowhere There seems to be no reasonable explanation for why lesser known players shouldnt be represented Im from and live in England but I dont see any reason why LOI players shouldnt have pages In fact others already do have pages which arent being removed 

Besides no need to worry any more Ive been blocked by Bwilkins for no apparent reason
