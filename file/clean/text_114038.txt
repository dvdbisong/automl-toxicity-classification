CRJ Bombardier

Listen IDIOT  the text can not be stolen from Bombardier  there is  NOTHING wrong from inclusion of text from Bombardier site  People like you should NOT be allowed to be moderators as you are vandalyzing  only Wikipedia articles  and reverting to a crap previously posted

ie  there is  no Pilot Observer  seat on Bombardiers as there i sNO room in the cocpit for it
It is very small and  compact cockpit where you can not have third seat unless you move the main entry door to the plane  or extend the  front housing cockpit   

1  the text under the fair use can be freely copied to be included in Wikipedia and BOMBARDIE  would be happy to have the text from their  website included
2  the Wikipedia text is  MISLEADING and full of  amatorish statments cause of kids playing eexperts

 So GET life  and look  for job at car wash instead  destroing the work of others

Learn about  FAIR USE  doctrine  before you vandalize more articles

What a  moron  you are
