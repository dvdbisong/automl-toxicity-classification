Mens ranking Figure While nice to look at misses key time between 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Championships 

Thats all there is to it in the title IIHF lists a 2010 postolympics ranking and 2010 ranking presumably postWC To exclude this period is incorrect as it is a time where Canada was ranked 1st overall Russia 2nd The same issue will happen this year as rankings will change twice after Olympics and again after WC7073141146
