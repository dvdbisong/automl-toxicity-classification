Thank you for your feedback on my article Konstantin Kakanias above May I assume that you issued the feedback on the main article page as well as the TalkKonstantin Kakanias page I am seeking further clarification on a few points If you have the kindness and the time please advise in further detail on the following at your convenience

In the critique of the article you I assume felt the article was written as if I were personally involved with Kakanias Would you tell me what part or parts of the article read as too personal I believe I used numerous external references and links to support the article text 
 On the talkKonstantin Kakanias page it says This article has been rated as StartClass on the projects quality scale Is it possible to be more specific in terms of what the article is missing or what should be left out in order to improve the ranking  
On the main page I received the feedback This article is an orphan as few or no other articles link to it In fact I was careful to create 20 links to other Wikipedia articles within the body of the main article Am I missing something here 

Again thank you for your assistance I would like to make any necessary improvements
