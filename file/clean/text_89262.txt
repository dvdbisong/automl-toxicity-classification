I dont agree blogs are biased They are overused in this article Secondly this reference and opinion is duplicated in the section We should not duplicate information in the same section I am going to leave it for a day to let another editor take a look at it and possibly improve the section 
Tomorrow I will remove one or both of them if they are still there I dont believe that the opinion is a significant point of view WPUNDUE the words of a lone lawyer even Larry Rosen is a very small number
  If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small or vastly limited minority it does not belong in Wikipedia except perhaps in some ancillary article regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not
 Using it to refute 2 large groups is wrong imho
