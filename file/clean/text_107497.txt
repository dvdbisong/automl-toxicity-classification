Dustin if you dont know  what the deal is why are you offering advice My experience at wp is that civil constructive editors are obliterated by the game players   this editor I dislike feels very free to harass others and portray admirable people as idiots  so I call him an idiot thats the language he uses  said Higgins was unworthy of being discussed by learned men ffs absurd  if he calls out a hero as a buffoon he cant complain when he  is adressed in language he uses but he will  right little squak hell set up  but my wp career is over and I dont care frankly you care if r gloucester is attacked and really this language is preposterous and over heated  but not if he attacks higgins its all just people   wp treats editors who are blocked over nothing like war criminals ffs  its grotesque really and it bodes ill for the retention of good faith intelligent editors all that will be left will be the povspa editors and  admins who dont actually edit articles but weigh in and ban good faith editors and collude with spaspov editors thats the deal  923109
