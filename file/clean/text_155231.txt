of course I posted my unblock request right as you posted this comment otherwise maybe I wouldnt have made the request Im not having any problems with anyone else as you can see but Tennis Expert has multitudes of problems Is it everyone else and not him I did not contact him and never would have except for his out of the blue attack I can accept punishment as well as the next guy and if you truly feel I was wrong for my response then I can live with a temporary block But what burns me is the injustice of being fair to both sides if I get smacked and TE gets tapped
