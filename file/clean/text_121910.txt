Date of death
In point of fact no reputable outlet is saying absolutely that he died on Sunday Feb 2 because theres no way yet to know that He was found on that day but he may very have died on Saturday Feb 1 before midnight He was seen alive around 7 pm that evening so he didnt die before then We can only truthfully say Feb 2014 or Feb 1 or 2 2014 

Before any editwars start is there any definitive concrete evidence that he definitely absolutely died on Sunday and not late Saturday night
