I would agree that a mess of examples is not a good thing If you read the history and the talk archives here you might also note that Im one of the editors who has been most active in removing such 
 a broadbased consensus to only B  C  Where  There has been no such consensus
 This article does not need a list of my favourite language but at the same time it does need true examples Not as language samples but as examples of what a Hello World program looks like for the benefit of the general principle Readers of this article need to see what such a program looks like and most importantly why one would bother Hello World in JavaScript is trivial  why would any programmer even care to write it  It makes much more sense for more difficult languages like assembler
 My edit was to readd examples for JavaScript Java and Assembler I have no particular attachment to these languages but JavaScript is contemporary and as simple as it gets Java is contemporary and demonstrates how a modern language might still need to be more verbose Assembler is obscure these days but it highlights just how much work can still be needed to get Hello World up and running I believe these three limited examples convey something of value at the level of a general article on Hello World and thus belong here
 You also removed the note on the Arduino and the use of nontext output devices in the Hello World context Why
 Finally Id point out that its not Bold  Revert  Edit war again because I KNOW IM RIGHT
