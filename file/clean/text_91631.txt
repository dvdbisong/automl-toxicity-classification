Nope Still no competing reference I see You keep adding unverified material while Im proposing a source to back my version Read WikipediaVerifiability Let me point out some salient points to you The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability not truthwhether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source not whether editors think it is true  ie you need to provide a source that justifies including Albert This policy requires that all quotations and anything challenged or likely to be challenged be attributed in the form of an inline citation that directly supports the material  again since Im challenging the inclusion of Albert you need to provide a source Anything that requires but lacks a source may be removed  thats what Ive been doing but you have been violating policy The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material  you have never shown that Albert operated any kind of independent command Instead you keep adding him while not adding anybody else at the same level of command You have never provided any kind of explanation for this
 Let me be very clear here Im going to add accurate cited content If you remove it you will be violating a core policy and Ill take you straight to DR Ive tolerated as much as Im going to from you and it stops now Â TCE
