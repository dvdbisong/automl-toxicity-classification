I changed the wording of the comparison between Anderson and Clarks tenure as coaches previously it said that Clark achieved even greater success however this does not seem like the right choice of words since during his tenure Anderson won the first 4 national championships contested before handing over the reins to Clark  Hard to say that you can achive greater success as a coach than winning each national championship your team played for so I worded it even more prolonged success to reflect this
