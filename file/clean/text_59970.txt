I happen to know that 769566209who hasnt a discete screen ID at this momentis not this MataNui44  So how do you like them apples 

I also can point out that I have been blocked or banned or whatever from editing Wikipedia when Ive never attempted to do so even where obviously and seriously warrantedbecause I dont care  It so happens that I handle my own research and if Wikipedia says this or that I confirm it in some legitimate source because it has been my experience that there are usually some fence sitters who climb up and occupy a postion they feel is important and swat down any newcomers howere talented or correct they may be  this happens all too often on various sites and is quite common  Wikipedia is no different and should you care to show me how it has effective controls to prevent some knowitall or other from controlling the board as it were Id be happy to listen

Otherwise the exercise I am reading here only confirms that I am money ahead by not bothering myself with what Wikipedia is or does particularly that part where you are painting user 76 as MataNui44  My true name and the one I always use as I stand behind my statements including those here is Randy Stone and you may find me at various sites such as All the Worlds Battlecruisers The Unofficial Krugman Page and Nihon Kaigun

Good Day gentlemen
