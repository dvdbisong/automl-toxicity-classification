rationaleTired of how things go here and wish to remove myself  I would actually choose to use my right to vanish but it seems that one can not do most things while blocked  Being blocked indefinitely for a first offense of speaking mildly ill of a fellow editor who had been aggressively and relentlessly hounding me  my organization is just the icing on the cake  I no longer want to give any more time here  I would appreciate it if someone could blank and delete my User Page even change my name as well  Again I can not put the request up on that page or blank it myself
