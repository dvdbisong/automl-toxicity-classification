death section 

It looked really shoddy I tightened up the prose condensed it into summary style There was also a paragraph of other material all of which was to be found elsewhere and didnt belong in the death section at all Finally I moved the eulogies into their own section as that really wasnt actually anything to do with his death persay

Actually i think those eulogies reek of NPOV but POV seems to be a touchy subject around here Would anyone mind if I deleted them entirely Storm Rider in particular Id like your opinion on this one
