as I remember all I did was that I changed the data because it was entirely wrong area instead of 69700 was saying only 2000 and the population was 32ooo or something like that  I know that there is a NOTE and I did nto do anything to it I think there are also many other countries with the same entirely incorrect data today I changed only georgia and armenia and next time I will try to fix most of them if someone will not do it before mefor example azerbaijan has the same data  problems as well on the Europe page I hope you will not abuse your power and block me for doing that too thank you
