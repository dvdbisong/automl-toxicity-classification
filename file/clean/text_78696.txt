Jsut some information for cultural purposes 
Where does the word Catalán comes from It is French It means the inhabitant of the Castles or Chastlains or castlans exactly the same than Castilian
When the word Catalán appears for the first time In 1115 mentioned by an italian cronist
When Catalonia became really independent By the Treaty of Corbeil in 1248 when the French Monarchie gave up his rights on the Marca Hispanica castles
Where was the idealised hero of Barcelona Wifredo el Vellosos born  in France in Carcassone
Was Roger of Lauria the great catalonian hero catalán Not at all he was born in Lauria Italy and served the King of Aragón
Were there Kings in Cataluña No never existed
Were there a Principado of Cataluña No never It is a Prince of Gerona but never was Cataluña a Principado
Stop trying to be what you are not You may be proud of some other things but neither you have ever been a Kingdom not a Principado nor you have had a clasic literature in catalán
Catalán is a dialect steaming from latin exactly the same than castillian provenzal italian or valenciano The difffrence is that while Valenciano had a dictionary  Liber Elegantiarum clasic romans Tirant lo Blanch traslations of the Bible to Valenciano Bonifacio Ferrer etc ALL THEM MENTIONING BLACK ON WHITE THAT THEY WROTE IN VALENCIANO LANGUAGE the Catalans had nothing and this is way the catalans desperately need to try to absorb the Valenciano becuase in catalan there is nothing to show
However culture is culture and mixtifications are only for ignorants
