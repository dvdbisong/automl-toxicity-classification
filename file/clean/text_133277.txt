Looks like theres a fullscale editwar going on again so I will be staying away I thought it was stable so I corrected a grammatical nonsense If a thing never happens again you can say that the following day it didnt happen or several months later it didnt happen or fifty years later it didnt happen and no one of those statements makes more sense than any other On the other hand if a thing does happen for instance at the end of a year when it is expected to happen you can still say that after several months it didnt happen and that might be quite true although it would still be nonsensical and in this case also misleading I changed it to Bucks contract with Vogue was not renewed period which in fact gives exactly the same amount of information If you knew when the contract was due to be removed you could say that and that would be a useful addition but nobody has ever thought to do that In any case if youre busting a blood vessel and writing a splenetic message on somebodys talk page over such a simple edit it might be time for you to take a step back and try to get a sense of proportion It looks as though youre letting that article take over your life and that is not healthy
