I dont think you were hasty at all  Have you requested arbitration   

 I want the two or three of them to decide if that really is the only way to move forward Although I am a Calvinist I am repulsed by legalistic approaches to resolving disputes  Although arbitration doesnt have to be legalistic a legalistic participant can force it to that
