Dear Sarah is not a question of translation with google translate or another if any meaning of certain phrases or expressions Italian is to make surreal and paradoxical in English my translation as a means of communication
It is an ironic writing not illiteracy
Then if we make serious I repeat as I have uploaded more pictures from the time of the discussion I repeat as administrators of the ML that they will send their consent to the use of images I suggested they use a Polaroid camera so you do not there will be problems of duplicate film for the rest  I think the pages edited by me speaks for itself that I always having used Wikipedia as in my good faith endeavoring to carry out a correct knowledge for the benefit of all not a few or personal
Copyright images I repeat as in my case the issue is gone as a presumption of guilt against me and restriction of use of them far beyond the actual size of my act and the alleged fraud committed or derivative
This is evident from reading the entire wikipedia regulation regarding copyright diligently as I did in those days
Especially I having had the direct consent of the ML for the use of the pictures the administrators of the ML have got copyright holders of the photos as can be seen from their website httpwwwmovimentolibertarioit or do you believe that even OrianaItaly denounce them for using of the pictures in question in violation of Copyright
Bye
