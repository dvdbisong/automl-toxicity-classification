Common speech is not fact That is my whole point on this argument For instance I personally do not recognise the term Old Firm Did Lord Nimmo Smith have any sources when he declared Rangers In Common Speech were capable of being owned and operated No because he was giving his opinion Had he been using the Law then he could not possibly say that the Club outwith could be owned and operated If you notice the part on Liquidation of Rangers I wrote on this page it also said in many peoples eyes declared the Old Firm tag as redundant The liquidation of Rangers and its impact on any Old Firm terminology should be installed on that page for people to get the full picture In the same fashion as the sectarian section doesnt mention Rangers unofficial sectarian signing policy Why is that information missing
