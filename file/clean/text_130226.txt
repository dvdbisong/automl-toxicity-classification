Section break for convenience
I know Fyslee will agree with you Herd  Id like to suggest leaving it out for now and returning when the rest of the article is more settled and it can be unprotected without a new flareup  Nothing that happens here or in my sandbox is permanently binding my goal is to improve the style and clarity of the article since I write this way all the time and act as a buffer and moderator between the extremes  I can see some potential value to expanding Marys story as long as it is done carefully Thatcher131
