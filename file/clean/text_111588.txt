Internal links
I have restored the internal links to articles which deal with the various subsections of this article in more detail  No reason valid or otherwise has been given for removing these links   

template  is not appropriate in this context  That template is used when the section is an exact WPSUMMARY of the main article  These sections instead deal or should deal only with the topic in relation to NWO  In these cases it is instead appropriate to simply link to the topic within the first sentence of the section   

I agree with Verdatum which is the reason I have and will continue to remove these internal links   2114 3 November
