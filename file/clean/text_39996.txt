As an apparent newcomer to Wikipedia I wanted to thank you for your mature and levelheaded post here  

This is almost exactly the kind of approach and mindset that eventually seems to go along with those who will edit this charitable endeavour well will enjoy Wikipedia and will personally learn  from their endeavours and through those same endeavours will improve the pages they edit for the benefit of others whom they often will never know

I wanted to say thank you and keep the same efforts going FT2 Talk  email
