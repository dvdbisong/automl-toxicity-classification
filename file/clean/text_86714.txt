Please read through the sources before commenting on it There has been no copypaste job but a quote has indeed been added from a second source Read the sources May god give more knowledge to all of us  

This is the source added into the article It concludes with this

Their attack on the masculine voice of rights autonomy and abstraction bodes ill for a liberal society Their effort to abolish male privilege while preserving and expanding
female privilege is likely to create the very backlash feminists fear Moreover most women do not want their brothershusbands or sons to live under a legal system that presumes them guilty nor do they believe that sex is rape freedom is a male plot and an abused woman can be her own judge jury and executioner

Unless anyone can come up with a formula that converts above statement into Feminism calls for equality I suggest refrain from adding that statement without proper source
