Dogmatic 

The use of the word dogmatic in relation to the Jesus Bloodline should be used in the same way that the word is used in relation to Christianity The objection to the usage of the word can only be made by those who are sympathetic to the Jesus Bloodline as a historical fact This is quite obvious The removal of the word is unwarranted Please do not alter this heading and integrate it into another discussion thread It will otherwise be reverted
