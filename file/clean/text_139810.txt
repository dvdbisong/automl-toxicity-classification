As I have mentioned there is a huge difference between a one time newspaper article and a continual
posting on wikipedia You have chosen to report his involvment in prop 37 in the most sensational and 
titillating fashion possible No good deed goes unpunished Mr Whealy and his family are very much living
persons and you are exponentially increasing the possibility of harm coming to them from your more
opportunistic readers Please stop this wholly gratuitous assault on his privacy
