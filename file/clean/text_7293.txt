Even the claim of essentially segregated lives is bogus Of course lives arent 100 integrated since these are two different cultures with different customs and languages But what separation exists is purely voluntary  some Arabs prefer to live in an Arab townvillage and thats understandable Most Arabs send their kids to Arab school  so they can study in Arabic However some send their kid to a Hebrew speaking school  I had an Arab classmate for instance whose father was a department head in the city hospital by the way Many Arabs live in towns with a Jewish majority and theres no law against that and no one prevents them from doing so Several cities in Israel have substantially mixed populations including Jerusalem Haifa Jaffa Lod Ramle Beer Sheva and others Theres no segregation and no separation
