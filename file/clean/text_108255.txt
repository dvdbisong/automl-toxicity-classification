Weird World of Wikipedia

With this in mind most people dealing with this issue attempt to mitigate the problem by understanding that all knowledge is situated knowledge and that all judgements come from a particular standpoint This means that it is understood that no one can claim to be 100 neutral or objective and that there are always power struggles involved when someone claims to be objective especially whilst engaging in partisan behaviour

One Click seems to me to be a bunch of paranoid zealots And I   will state again that before I tried to tone down the shit they put on the Wessely page I had never heard of them or Simon Wessely

A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children suffering from ME suggests that there are around 250000 in the UK yet it is rarely diagnosed by the medical profession is fleetingly mentioned in government research funding documents is seldom accepted by medical research workers and is almost never admitted to by insurance companies 

TABSince 1986 while gathering around him an entourage of like minded disciples which has become known as the Wessely School Professor Simon Wessely has almost singlehandedly been responsible for the strategy of a moratorium on the investigation of ME as an illness  with a physically neurological cause Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses CFS are the product of false illness beliefs mental aberrations which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and antidepressants 

TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the Londonbased Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in Kings College teaching hospital He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups and is advisor to the British Armed Services While his membership of an official web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minorityview groups set up by or aligned with US and British quackbuster organisations 

TABJust before Christmas 2005 the Wikipedia an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia was host to a small anonymous entry about Professor Wessely The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wesselys psychiatric view of ME On seeing this entry Jane Bryant of the One Click OC campaign substituted a longer text which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wesselys role in the politics of ME 

TABWhen this longer text was seen by the Wikipedia edit police who cruise the pages seeking vandalism and skewed edits it was immediately considered to break most of Wikipedias self serving rules On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia Jimbo Wales in an attempt to put their case the OC campaign received a personal communication from him 

Although Wales aimed at a slight upbeat and reconciliatory tone in his email the text was scattered with veiled insults He accused One Click participants of behavioural problems while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that anything from your site will be treated with extreme scepticism Jimbo Wales ended his email with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas 

TABWhen however OC answered Jimbo with a rebuttal of his argument in favour of an orthodox objectivity and neutrality  we are not going to be advocates for or against either side in this dispute  the debate entered another level

TABIt seems possible that Professor Wessely having been alerted to his Wikipedia entry began to liaise with Wikipedia and the business of drafting a  Sovietstyle biographical text about him was given to the indulgently named Just Zis  Guy you know Clearly I have no intention of using this onanistic sobriquet in this essay and so will refer to him as ZG

TABThere ensued an argument about One Clicks contribution to the Wessely entry which though handled w
