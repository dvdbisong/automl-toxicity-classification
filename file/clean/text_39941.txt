1 Clean up the references  Perhaps put them in some kind of logical order or even just date order

2 Stop the doubling up

3 Make evidence presented more concise

4 Display it better  For example prosecution argument vs defence argument as sections

5 Consider separating trialcase from Peter Falconio biography to aid in clean up

Most of this probably needs to wait until the trial is completed though  For now perhaps just tolerate its untidiness
