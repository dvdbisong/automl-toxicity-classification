IR Explanation

Blessed morning

This email is regarding the IR issued for the call I received last October 7 2010 BP Patrice McKenzie

That afternoon I was the only one on the queue and prior to Ms McKenzies call I received a MVI call but MVI was not successful due to previous balance as well as the proof of residency required And because I was the only one on the qeue I wasnt able to log out or refresh my system

During the call of Ms Mckenzie the POR pop box came and I informed the SME that time Mario Raymundo that I have not informed my customer because I know that it was system glitch Also because tnere is no active account on the address I was not the one who released the order but someone from Off Line Services I endorsed the account to Mario to make necessary adjustments on the account He texted me at around 1am to inform me that he had already talked to someone from OLS and that no POR is really required for the address so it was released

After receiving the QA score I also sent an email to dispute the score that I got because I believe that I did not do anything that is not in accordance with the business rules
Here are the reasons why
1 I was the only agent in autoin for 1hour and 30mins
2 I informed my support about the situation and I was approved that there is not need to inform the customer of the POR
3 There is no active account on the address
4 I was not the one who released the order

I dont know what adjustments would be made but I hope there will be considerations

Thank you
God bless
