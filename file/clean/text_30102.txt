Thank you 

I am studying Sociology in school and am doing an essay on the scientific method and its application to sociology  I have poured over all of my books to find a definition for falsifiability other than that given in the ohsotrusty Websters to no avail  I came across this web page and can now continue on with the essay  Thank you so for having a wonderful free information source 0126 17 Dec 2004 UTC
