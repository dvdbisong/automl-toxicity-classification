Indeed it does continue to get weirder and even weirder 

  Charles Karel Bouley 

1458 21 September 2009 Kelly A Siebecke talk  contribs 10340 bytes the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them removing them or exaggerating them  edit reverted 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous removed undue repetition I exaggerated nothing
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kellys talk page This is simply untrue Her only warning was not to TALK what are talk pages for 
A little history I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view My mistake After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral They accepted thatI am not a wideeyed fan or close friend We have a very intermittent working relationship However I am privy to the truth of his schedule personal facts his history and the details of the death of his partner whom I also knew I also participate in his chat room 
In the chat room I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue I didnt really take it seriously As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people So I was not expecting any problems FYI I have a Masters degree in Medical Sociology a Doctorate in divinity In my BA studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution 
In my observation of Karels article I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced I made what I considered objective and neutral edits My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks removing positive facts and their references She will tell you I am not good at references She is right Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those I still have a lot to learn BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie andor demeaning to Karel I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine That is just ludicrous I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karels page Go back to the original article and compare if you can I will have NO reason to edit when Karels page is cleaned up and stays that way Karel has requested that it be locked There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences She does that repeatedly Yes he was fired Twice No reason to repeat it over and over Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted It is sad I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail I am tired I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted  She is petty and without relent AS the great philosopher Rodney King said why cant everybody just be nice  I work with Karel I know the good the bad and the ugly and will record such as long it is truthful and factual
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it Please help I am a nice lady with a little temper My grandchildren think I am awesome I am funny I have something to contribute I was Valedictorian at age 42 Work with me please I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone I was wrong
I am a hospice minister and Wiki was a f
