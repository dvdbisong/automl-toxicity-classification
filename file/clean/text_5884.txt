I noticed that someone changed the redirect to another sister article of DMK If clearly different opinions exist on the best redirect a DAB page might be a good compromise to avoid an edit war Before creating the DAB I also tested a small sample of airport codes like HKG SGP AMS CDG A good proportion of them are DAB pages So the DAB page seemed like a good solution here DMK is still very new so the number of references is probably still small That makes it only more important that it can be found easily in WP
