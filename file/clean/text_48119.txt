Understood The page for Juana la Iguana is now live It is a very well known show in Venezuela During its run from 1996 to 2003 it achieved some of the highest TV ratings for young kids and sold some of the top grossing home videos The page does make reference to the character and the TV show so I understand if you have concerns with that Can I add the show to the list or would there be other concerns
