Rambelli Fabio  わたしは外人ですか

Nobodys mentioned httpciniiacjpnaid110004041388 this article yet written in Japanese by httpwwwsapporouacjpbunkarambellihtm this guy correct Although not without a fair number of つっこみどころ such as ポリティカルウンコンシアス and すごい変なアクセント not to mention being somewhat lacking in depth and more so a description of one mans experiences the authors it is nonetheless relatively academic and may be reasonable as a source for the article especially since there seems to be somewhat of a lack of sources actually written in Japanese Just thought Id throw it out there Additionally httpciniiacjpnaid110000226452 this article also popped up on google scholar and looked potentially interesting but it looks like Ill have to see if I can get an interlibrary loan in order to access it myself If someone has more immediate access than I do it may be worth looking up
