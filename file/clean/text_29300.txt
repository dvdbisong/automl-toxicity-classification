 ReFlaBot 

 not the impersonator  The bot was blocked due to the unresolved issues  I will cite my examples         the list can go on  I dont know how many of these are valid or invalid  I do know for certain that the edit made at Doraemon was incorrect and made by  talk 0938 4 Jun 2005 UTC
 Furthermore I find it highly suspicious that the contributions of the said impersonator F I a B o t with the letter I as in I for Impersonator occurred 18 hours after I blocked FlaBot with the letter L as in L for Liar  talk 0957 4 Jun 2005 UTC
