Resolution Must be Made

I have been an observer of this article on Abbas Babei since the start of this conflict I want to point out that we this issue needs to be solved otherwise both users will face blocks Hooperag has offered a proposal that makes logical sense Imagine this was the article of Barack Obama we cant just say Obama is notorious for his merciless treatment towards the minters of parliament who oppose his policies thats a totally random example but whatever It is more appropriate that if you wish to include a subjective statement like Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers considered disloyal to the new regime you include some background info on who made that statement add more context The word merciless is very subjective opinion based and if it is to be used you cant use it as if it was fact based when you say Babaei was notorious for his merciless treatment of the pilots and officers you are making a strong statement about him that makes it seem as if it is a 100 true fact that he was merciless
 For these reasons I suggest we rephrase the sentence to be something along the lines of Hooperags suggestion whish was to rephrase it something like this According to the famous historian Tom Cooper whom interviewed various Iranian pilots Abbas Babaei was considered merciless in his treatment towards pilots disloyal to the new regime

I wish to make it clear that I do not endorse any party neither Hooperag nor the IP However the proposal sounds reasonable and has been the only proposal to resolve this dispute so farIf this issue is not resolved with in the next 24 hours or so and the conflict continues I will request to an admin that both users be blocked134397759
