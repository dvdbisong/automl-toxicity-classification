Werner Franz cabin boy death announcement 

Werner Franz who is mentioned in the article has been announced on BBC News as having died today That is the announcement is today they did not say which day he died He is not linked but I think it is best to stay off until we know which day he died until we add a little sentence or split para to mention that the BBC said he was the last living survivor of the Hindenburg disaster

I mention this as a better editor than I can probably incorporate it better For that reason I include no links since it will be easily looked up and I imagine there will be brief obits in various papers but not to hit the Sundays too late
