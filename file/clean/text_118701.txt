well when I was going through adding the article history template when it was first being rolled out i found it hard because some pages had the archives neamed weirdly others had comments 3 months after it was pulled It doesnt matter much now since the bot is doing most of the updaing At least I could do the basic move to archiveX and update article history It would also be nice if once your sweep of the FAC pages was done you could do the PR
