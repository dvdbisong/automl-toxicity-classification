Its hardly libel nor is it revenge I dont even recall a google cache that you got deleted Please provide the ref to satisfy my curiosity No this is about circumventing a topic ban by creating a sock Thats all I happen to hate sockpuppetry and fight it when I see it You arent the only one I often go after socks and hunt them down and make sure they get what they deserve Its not about admins or not It really makes no difference You screwed up royally by using a sock Your defenses here have only dug your hole deeper by showing you dont understand the seriousness of that offense and of the reasons for your topic ban You keep blaming others instead of seeking to understand and promise to reform I have seen many a blocked editor succeed in getting their block overturned at the last minute by showing they had the ability to learn from their mistakes take full responsibility for their own actions and the consequences that followed and show promise that they could develop a positive learning curve You have flunked on all counts Too bad BTW an indef ban isnt lifelong IF you avail yourself of the offer proferred above

 BTW you have now attempt to get you block overturned three times I dont recall ever seeing a fourth attempt succeed Usually it is seen as evidence of WPIDIDNTHEARHAT and the block then applied to the talk page Also if you keep arguing in the manner in which you have been the result can be the same You ONLY hope is to show complete contrition and a very clear explanation of exactly what you did wrong and how you regret it and will do better Nothing less will do A single word more of blaming others and your goose is cooked Well its already cooked but it wont get uncooked if you persist
