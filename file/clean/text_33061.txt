Page Moves 

I just saw you move Chloroma to Chloromabb to BBBcoma and then copy and paste from BBBcoma to Chloroma  This removed the page history from the page which is not allowed under the licensing Wikipedia uses  I suggest you straighten this out at requested moves since an administrator has to fix it now  
My bad still learning how to do things Ive listed it on the Cutandpaste repairs page to get straightened out Thanks for your attention  
It has been fixed by an admin Apologies again  

Medical advice
I think that the wiki has a policy of not giving medical advice or this what I got a message about once   
I changed parts of the bone marrow biopsy page from advice to a tutorial style  

References
Hi When adding references to an article it is easy to use this tool to create a reference that uses the cite journal template from only a pmid as found in pubmed  

Section ordering
I saw you put the see also section in acute myelogenous leukemia back at the end of the article However it is described in the wikipedia manual of style that this section should be placed before the references and external links sections See WikipediaManual of Style headingsStandard appendices  

 ReSpeedy action 

Im just glad I was able to deal with it before it got out of hand Keep a close eye for other page moves that may be done by  sockpuppets or so he claims  

 Accusations you made against Harvey Bialy 

 I see no external not wiki source for you grave accusation against Harvey Bialy Please provide us with that external source You MUST do it Thank you

One can find any number of uncouth Bialy quotes here including the one which I mentioned However my source was the dissident AIDSWiki which proudly publicized Bialys comments here By the way it was not so much a grave accusation as a direct quote from Bialy which he himself has gone out of his way to publicize An accusation is unnecessary his words speak for themselves  

The accusation was to say that Bialy said that but seems that he said it We do not know what was said in the previous dialogue with the other guy though 

Wikipedia is a tertiary source and anyone can write anything Thats the reason I asked you for an external source Anyway thank you for the references 

No problem you were right to demand a source I didnt mean to give you a hard time about that  

Its all OK Thank you

Depo Provera talk
Thanks for request commentary on TalkDepo Provera Ive tried not to take sides    I well appreciate your intentions to help improve this article and that you probably have greater familiarity than myself with the research into this area As you invited the commentary having recognised your own sense of getting more argumentative Ive mostly focused on your style of debate However I did feel only fair to then offer as an example an alternative wording to one of Cinderys postings too I truely do not wish to cause either of you il
