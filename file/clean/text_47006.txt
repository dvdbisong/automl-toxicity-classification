mlbcom images 

Hi Nishkid  I saw you RfA listing and began looking through your contributions when I noticed that youve uploaded about 100 player portraits from mlbcom tagging them as  One problem is that none of them contain fair use rationales The more important problem is that they do not meet criterion 1 of WPFUC As these players are living and especially because they are active and perform in public 162 times a year there is ample opportunity for contributors to take their own photographs and release them under free licenses  We need images like that that like their articles text can be used anywhere by anyone The problem with using these photographs even in the short term and even if they are intended for publicity purposes and Im not certain these are is that it greatly hurts our chances of acquiring the free alternatives Best of luck on your RfA
