Kaitokuji 

Heres an attempt at a Haiku even though its more of proof that I read UserAlexfCSD than anything else
bout Kaitokuji
the article wasnt bad
please undelete it

Ive posted a message on the articles talk page to ask for undeletion but I believe it went unnoticed Either way I would like to request for it to be undeleted because I believe that if the Japanese Wikipedia is allowed to have an article about it so does the English Wikipedia A different content language in my opinion doesnt make a difference in notability The only reason it didnt have sources is because I do not know the format for those and I doubt I can just copy them from Japanese Wikipedia without giving a romanizedtranscribed version of them

Thanks for considering to undelete Id like to request you to also put a talkback template on my talk page when you see this and have responded because Im not visiting Wikipedia that frequently and may forget Looking forward to your response
