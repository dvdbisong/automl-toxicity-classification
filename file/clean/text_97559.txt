Proposal Going back to the bare bones again 

Until this article is deleted as it should have been originally barring admin incompetence I propose going back to this version which is the cutdown version deliberately edited

 The amount of text is more proportionate to his notability  There isnt much point in having pages and pages of material on somebody who is entirely unnotable 
 The article doesnt go into detail about the obvious and welldiscussed problems  it just ignores them
 This seems to be the best option for BLP reasons
 This also seems to be the best option in the light of the fact that this article is being edited by people who fundamentally dont understand the problems that we have
 It also solves the problem of avoiding interpretation of sources which is sailing closer to WPNOR
