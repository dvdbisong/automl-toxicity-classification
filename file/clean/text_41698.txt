Why did you erase ABA can cure autism 

I added a ref tag that leaded to the website saying that the first person who invented Applied Behavior Analysis ABA cured dozens of kids and was very successful My son had autism until he was 5 he had no language had motor skills constant tantrumsmeltdowns avoided eye contact he would cry when the motor in the back of the car would star it would hurt his ears  Sensory Issues he had trauma sleeping problems etc He had an ABA HomeInstructed Program it turned out very succesful he gained his language and no longer had autism he is a preteen now and goes to a specialed school for the IQ of average or above he is functioning now So I know this for a fact It even said it on the article but doesnt mean every person with autism could get better from it through early intervention not with severe autism So could you please revert my edit Thanx
