How is it pointless  Its engaging a social conversation  I think you have given me another warning and it is completely unwarranted  You may interpret what I say as being a personal attact but you cant know for sure  You didnt tell me I wasnt allowed to have a conversation with you about my favourite movies but if you feel that strongly about it then I wont  And yet without any irrefutable or even substancial evidence I think you have given me another warning  I have the right to be innocent until proven guilty i should think  Also do you have a job you seem to always be here
