TalkJosephus 

I noted your concerns in respect of the attempt to strip Josephus of his Jewish identity by relegating his Hebrew name to a footnote and the use of the Christological date references

I invite you to read my comments hereafter addressed to another user and all of the contents of the discussion of Josephus talk 

I am really offended by the ex post facto christianization of this article How can this possibly be justified The article in question is a Jewish history article and the arguments to remove Jewish references are so weak that an inference of bigotry is manifest My recent interest in the article is that I had forgotten Josephus Hebrew name the current form of the article is not encyclopedic talk 

As you can see this is an old dispute Lets sort it out at the articles talk page  ну 

I have carefully read and reread the discussion page and Im afraid that the only conclusion possible is that the users promulgating AD over CE and relegating the Hebrew name to a footnote are antisemites pure and simple If necessary I will demonstrate this but I think any reasonable reading of the discussion fails to accept an alternative conclusion It appears that you have made too many concessions in the past Generosity is admirable but not to the point of diminishing logic well established historical conventions and Jewish dignity I am not sure what course of action to take I have been registered in Wikipedia for just a few weeks talk
