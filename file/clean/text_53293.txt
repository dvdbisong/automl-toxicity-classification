Hello Deval khandelwal and welcome to Wikipedia Thank you for your contributions

I notice that one of the first articles you created  appears to be an article about yourself This is a common mistake made by new Wikipediansas this is an encyclopedia we wouldnt expect to have an article about every contributor Your user page however is a great place to write about yourself making sure to stay within user page guidelines Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in and edit it normally

The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia but if you want to use the content from it dont hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page

If you are stuck and looking for help please come to the New contributors help page where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have Or you can just type  on your user page and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions Here are a few other good links for newcomers
