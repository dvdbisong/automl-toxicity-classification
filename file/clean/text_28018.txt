The Yemen times article is full of misinformation 950 AD Ethiopian civilization starting in 500 AD Maybe they meant BC but still Ethiopian civilization is older than that Good job on finding the link by Negash Ive seen it before and its informative on the postAksumite and Zagwe period It has nothing to do with Sheba however as that happened if it even did ca1000950 BC not AD The first one is rather odd because its written by the same person who wrote Aksum I cant really comment on it but no one has ever said that Dmt was founded by Sabaeans as it predates the Sabaean migration by a few centuries Im not sure why he assumes that all of the 500 BC inscriptions in Sabaean does he mean script or language were made by Sabaeans either since Ethiopians used the same script May I ask what you are trying to demonstrate with those links   Yom  contribs  Talk  E
