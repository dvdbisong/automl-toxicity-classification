Hi and thanks for the invitation Let me ponder my wikiplate  THE PROBLEM we face here is the way the media throws around the word superpower per category of influence  see the article in The Economist they cited An economic superpower and now oil too Superpower isnt the magic word it used to be  The other issue is of course the word potential  In infinite time anything is possible potentially 

 NOTE Breaking that section out as a separate article is really the heart of the problem Once you get away from the page which attempts to clarify what superpower means its harder to argue against eg prestigious magazine headlines But will ponder what to do about this
