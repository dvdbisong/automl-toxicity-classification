Just to be clear in many cases I personally added a link pair like July 4 1976 in radio1976 to an article so 1 I created that link pair 2 I did not realize that it broke autoformatting and 3 I acknowledge that date autoformatting is now deprecated and is being removed by the bot  Also to be clear Lightbot is converting my example above to July 4 1976 which 1 created a new yet deprecated autoformatted date link pair and 2 removes the useful on topic link to 1976 in radio  Given that there is no consensus for an urgent removal of date autoformatting Im simply asking that the bot not undo date in radio links if it cant as you note handle them properly
