RFA

I give you kudos for putting up an RFA although it may fall under harsh critiscm Have you thought about joining some of the Wikipedia projects however I do not know if you are into biographies but the WP Biography Project may be a good place to start We are having a Summer Assessment Drive which you are more than welcome to join in on Simply we will be assessing articles that have had the WPBiography template placed on their talk page but recieved no assessment While doing that  what I suggest doing and I try to make a habit of it as often as I can focus on it  is to help advance the article itself but tagging to be expanded or if it contains no references to tag it for references and create a references section and adding the reflist template so when references are added in the future they will automatically generate there Being a part of a Wikipedia project helps to broaden your experience on Wikipedia while giving you a great insight to a lot of the policies procedures etc Also check out WPAFD and peruse some of the discussion there to get an idea on how Articles for Deletion work or some of the WPPolicies and how they are implemented and adhered to If you need help with anything or have a question drop me a note
