Poll to keep or remove film clarification

There is an edit in dispute on the Mamas Family article between UserLeopea and myself I would like to keep film article or at least film in parenthesis beside Eunice in the opening so that its clear there exists an article for the film as opposed to the character I myself had no idea we had an article on the character until yesterday nearly a year after the articles creation I thought it was just a link to an article for the character Just for clarification purposes I thought there was no harm done in having film in parenthesis next to the name but I have been reverted several times by UserLeopea who keeps saying there is no confusion Given that he himself created the article and knows of its existence I really dont feel he should have any say as to its confusion I feel I am a more reliable source to go by as I had no idea of the articles existence and pressed that link to be directed to an article on the character So now I am creating a poll to see whether or not we should keep or remove film article

Keep  based upon my reasons listed above
