Hello I am sorry if I bullied you in any way Those comments were not meant to harass but as of late people have been deleting Sean Harris page with things like FBFJBFJfjdbbfa and the hidden message was meant to thwart those people I accidentally saved a copy of the page with that same hidden message so when I reverted the page I accidentally left those hidden messages along with it I saw Beware the Night and realized that the date has been pushed back to 2014 I was acting frivolously and I apologize Before I began editing Sean Harris page it consisted of nothing more than a few paragraphs of information and I took the liberty of giving him a table featuring his film and TV work I never meant to be a bully but those hidden messages were out of line and were not directed to the edits concerning his early short films I reverted them because I didnt find them on IMDB but now I realize I am in the wrong and I apologize dearly I would very much like to start anew and I thankyou for your edits and help on Sean Harris page Hes a great actor after all
