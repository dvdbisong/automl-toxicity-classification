I wasnt speaking of the Hebrew spellings of Samael verses Samuel but the way the Hebrew name Shemuwel was transliterated by the Latin speaking people of Rome to Samuel which is almost the same aa Samael Obviously because the Jews did say that Samael was the patron of Rome so they must have took it to heart and decided to venerate him instead of choosing a true translieration of Shemuwel I was being funny when I said Latinese It is still proper English though I dont have to speak the Queens English 995617463
