Cheers Ceoil I much liked your edit on the Standing Madonna Only here for a few days more  Back next year maybe I want to get the Chroniques de Hainaut miniature in as well as the embroidery I scanned and uploaded to Commons from the expensive Campbell  Van der Stock I scanned the Justice  from 

Kind regards
