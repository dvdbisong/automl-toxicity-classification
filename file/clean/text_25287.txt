Have  you ever seen any Irish village articles called by a joint name like Valleymount and Lacken I have never seen such a naming structure besides which it would fail the common naming conventions For the time being it is a stub and there are many other Irish stubs around Thats just the way it is BTW there is no disagreement just a difference of opinion between two editors but if you review WPCOMMONNAME as I have linked it you will agree with me too that the status quo is correct Cheers
