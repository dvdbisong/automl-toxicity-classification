Starcheers doesnt say anything about banning stylization Heshe says that the inclusion of the  isnt required Allow me to explain why the inclusion of  is different to the inclusion of a letter  stands for one of two things its a symbolic representation of the word number or it is a social media mechanism hashtagging most prominently used on twitter If the name of the song was read and sung as hashtag that power but was written as thatPower then including the  is detrimental to the name However the name of the song as per whats song and said outloud is that power Therefore the inclusion of the  is for the social media mechanism rather than to represent the word number As a result the reason to include the  is stylistic ie its a stylistic choice for the copyright the copyright being legally registering the song is a recorded work but it is not pronounced in the work nor is it part of the title the inclusion of i in iphone is not stylistic it is part of the copyright and part of the name thus including the i is detrimental to the work in question as a phone and an iphone are two different things whereas thatpower and thatpower are one in the same as in this context the  has no meaning   talk 1950 21
