I know but Chechnya has its own flag etc Than Tunsian and Suadi fighters You could add a separate part where its describes all the fighters by nationality Another thing is US and British involvement Britian sends the Syria opposition food weapons armored vehicles etc And the US sends mercenaries like Eric Harroum or something who was captured a month ago So for supported by or even combatant their should be US or other western powers
