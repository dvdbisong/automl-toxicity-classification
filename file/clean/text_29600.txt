This page needs a major rewrite Its contents are controversial yet the discussion of the controversial aspects does not cite references Some of the the sub topics fail to justify how they help explain the primary topic instead they mention tangential controversy wihout satisfactorily connecting that controversy with the subject matter For example mention of the Reimer case does not contribute to the sub matter here Another example would be failure to cite the actual Johns Hopkins articles the evidence of their bias and lack of scientif rigor or the various subsequent studies that refute the Johns Hopkins article which is over 25 years old and out dated at best Also few other topics on medical procedures spend so much time discussing external opinions about them made by religious extremists who lack medication education Those few might only be abortion and invitro fertilization
