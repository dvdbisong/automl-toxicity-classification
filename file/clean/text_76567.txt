Outdenting is tricky on subdiscussions  My feeling is that if outdenting is required in a discussion with bullet ponts you should reindent at least   But it was only 8 deep which I dont consider too deep  If it reaches a point where you have to decide whether the discussion is to be atall readable on narrow monitors or decipherable on normal or wide monitors you have to go with the wide     talk
