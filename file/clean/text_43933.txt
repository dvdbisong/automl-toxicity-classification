Ive marked FileMy_Brother2006jpg as PDself but since you werent the photographer for the others I need confirmation that youve got permission from the photographers to release the images into the public domain  Under current copyright law everything is copyrighted as soon as its created  I think automatic copyright is the secondbiggest mistake in copyright law the biggest being the insanely long copyright terms but its the way things work
