I have edited the article which was a large percentage negative not NPOV toward Fandango Inc for charging a mere 150 for using their services  Of course this should be mentioned but negative comments did not need to be made about a business actually charging money for their services  Using Fandago is a convienence and the phrase PRICE GOUGING which was in the article implies that they are charging too much money when consumers have no alternative on how to get the product  They can go to the theatre box office and avoid paying the 150 easilyif they want to not wait in line they choose to patronize Fandango and pay the fee  Also the fact that many people feel that it is unfair is ad populumhasty generalization that I have never heard about Fandango before I work for a movie exhibitor and usetalk to others that use Fandango without any reference other than the authors first hand accounting
