Hi user Tajik is systematically searching and changing Turkish related articles with wrong and unsourced informations WikiArticles are not improving because of hisher wrongly editings HeShe is searching turk or turkic words in an article and deleting or deforming sentence or changing with persian word in a baseless way And he generally makes this secretly HeShe is making these changes with minor edits 
A check to the minor edit box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the current and previous version typo corrections formatting and presentational changes rearranging of text without modifying content et cetera A minor edit is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute
By contrast a major edit is a version that should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors Therefore any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor even if the edit is a single word
However Tajiks systematically minor editings hardly affects of articles And heshe always uses this illegal method Please have a look at hisher contributions
