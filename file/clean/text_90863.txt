If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism do so at their right articles The way you try to shove those topics in an article about Nationalities in Spain looks like youre trying to inject your personal unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article Please stop doing that  

My dear 8120296146 please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that for it is not your duty to tell me so Give your opinion and defend it as you may as I am doing and put the full stop after it Now it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of those independentist movements Sorry I wont bother creating an article entitled Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism but I do believe that if theres an article that deals with X nationalism or Nationalities in Y which includes X nationalism it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups To your accusation

 I already assumed above that I was biased as anyone else my quote Of course this Im saying is only part of the story but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article
 I havent edited the article yet because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me
 Due to 1s  as anyone else your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article thus unveiling your point of view So whats wrong about it
 The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article

I dont know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article clearly not the article itself My own are simply that if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as nationalities in Spain wed better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told

 

 Why cant I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect You are in fact doing the same by asking me not to do it See the irony I wasnt issuing orders just asking kindly for you to stop doing that If you dont want to its ok
By order
1 Everyone is biased thats ok But Wikipedia is not a soapbox If you want to voice your personal concerns about spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia thats fine with me but please dont do it in an eclyclopedical article right When we contribute to a wikipedia article its not enough to go OK Im biased because I think this and that so let the battle begin No we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible Im not trying to point out my ideas in an article as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually reach a middle ground in the articles content No Im trying to be objective in this article and youre not because youre admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article
2 Thats very respectful of you and I think its the right thing to do
3 No it doesnt I am not trying to push an agenda here I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic theyre about If I for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had in an article about Sabino Arana you could rightfully accuse me of preventing obnoxious information from getting into the article But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities were talking about in this article is just asking for something entirely reasonable See the far away link between your proposed terrorist issue stuff and the actual content of the article As I said create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain and everything will be fine By your same reasoning anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism
4 What did I state that was false I made only one comment before this one just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism Seems perfectly reasonable to me Bye  

And I wonder which are the sources for the map with that supposed ensemble of Nations States Confederations and Residents Associations
