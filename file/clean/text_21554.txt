Date of Birth 

Without much trouble I found a half dozen uses of the LDS Family Search genealogy database in longstanding Wikipedia entries Youre misinterpreting httpsenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaBiographies_of_living_personsAvoid_misuse_of_primary_sources  It would be applicable if I went to New York and accessed primary birth records The LDS website uses a third party aggregator as described at the reference In addition when you deleted the date of birth this time you deleted the place of birth
