Hey Kpjas
I really dont have time to go further and report these attacks but I would just point out to you that  those who I was dealing with these days they are all remaints of one destructive and defeated force theyre the ones who glorify their fascisoid NDH and fascism and who salute heil Hitler at the soccer stadiums They the cronationalists are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples They are the same ones who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970s and spread hatred and separatism between exYugoslavians And now since all the world stood against them theyre playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language finding some nonexisting matters with only to them known quazisources People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them something that wikipedia should probably do too I am actually surprised how I didnt get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cronationalists edits off in the next minute I hope they will do it again whenever they are aware of whats going on Anyhow I wish you all the best in your editing on wikipedia if I have time in the future  Ill join it as an editor too and at the end I want to repeat again please control the cronationalists on wikipedia as much as you can because they are nothing but distructive elements of a defeated nationalistic propaganda and who behind the mask of good people have always some hidden agenda that theyre working on luckilly with no effect Best Regards to you Krzsysztof and to Hexagon1 Cheers
