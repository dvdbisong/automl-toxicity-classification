If you read my response to you I explained to you that what you were referring to was NOT a personal attack but a matter of legal fact and offered to send you documented verification in a nonpublic manner  And further EVEN having said that I also said that I would refrain from including those documented facts if for some strange reason you didnt think those like those particular facts  So I cannot possibly understand your stance having been offered proof you are mistaken and ALSO deferring to your whim of not including said facts

For the record I also very much agree this is not the place for personal wars which WAS MY POINT FROM THE BEGINNING  Im trying not to be insulting here but to come around to my original point of view and then claim the higher moral ground is absurd

Also for the record you recently edited claiming it was from Shivers point of view but the FACT that he left both wives and filed for divorce is a matter of public record and is also verified in Ms Buells own autobiography as suspect as that may be so I cant imagine where the discrepancy comes in  I am his neighbor so if you need any documentation sent to you I will do so but only privately as Mr Shivers is very much against humiliating anyone publicly
