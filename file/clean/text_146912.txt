Anyway I am tired of everyone walking on eggshells and not stating what the problem is flat out The Visual editor app has a lot of potential but well meaninged though it may be in its current form its a piece of crap that we dont need or want I and many others have tried to say that in nicer ways but no one is listening so its time to be blunt If that hurts your feelings Im sorry but it needs to be said
