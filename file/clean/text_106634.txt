NOT balanced way TOO negative 

I think this article is much too negative and a smear campaign against BP As a company BP has a fine record and is much safer than many others Oil spills happen it is inevitable This fear mongering does nothing and seems designed to fit the lib and MSM agenda of preventing american energey indepenance by making it illegul to drill in Alaska where there is OIL If you dont like it fine but no need to sensationalize some relatively minor event as if it were a gigantic asteroid about to kill 100 million people 

This article is a sad and cynical exercise in yellow journalism

To improve it there needs to be more info about the process of oil extraction the frequency of oil spills BPs technological advances and fine safety record and the need of oil to make the american economy run without giving money to terrorists There needs to be an effort to establish the CONTEXT of this so that it is not turned into some political demlib point scoring stuff
