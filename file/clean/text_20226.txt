Name Change Proposal 
As I stated above I believe that those who use and contribute to this page should be the ones to decide a fitting name and whether the lost text and tables belong  Thus I am making a proper proposal to be discussed and voted upon by those interested
a I propose that the List format be dropped and replaced with a name that is not constrained by restrictive WPRules  
b I propose the name Major League Baseball Career Leaders in Pitching Wins slightly changing the proposal above by 
c I propose that the discussion and lost tables should be returned to the page as directly relevant to the subject informative and useful to those interested in the subject and to those searching for that information
Lastly I propose that discussion on this topic should remain open for a week and that no sweepng changes be made until there is some measure of agreement  If users decide to keep the page the way it is fine  But we should not have to merely accept the destruction of the page and the useful information it previously contained
