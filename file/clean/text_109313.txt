 Thanks 
Thanks for cleaning up my talkpage after vandalism took place within 15 minutes after it happened You beat me to it by several minutes  

 Your User page 
Hmm It looks the same to me Try refreshing the awards page then clicking  

Actually projects looks offcentre on both versions of the page down to where the userboxes stop on both Firefox and IE Im not sure why though

 Admins noticeboard 

Hi SWD

I notice you replied to David Gerards comments on WPAN Its possibly worth pointing out that these last lines were jokes  blocking 00000 means blocking every IP on the planet from editing hey it would stop all the stupidity and metaFriends of gays should not be allowed to edit articles is an old longrunning joke on Wikipedia stemming from the amount of vandals that seem to really really want to tell us their friend Jeff is gay Just thought Id point this out before you get worried this entire thing is a rather messy fiasco but those bits were humourous   

 Any time 
Any time hun  I told you your page rocks  Btw keep me informed about your problem and remember if you need any advice or help on the matter Ill be here in case you need me  Smooch TTYL
