The CNN controversy section could use expanding anyway Theres alot of information I picked up that I didnt add previously because of size constraintswell that and also because of some highly opinionated editors and admins here it turns out that its illegal for me to write such that less than 60 of the Controversy article suggests CNN is proSaddam and liberalbiased Anyway theres more I can add to the new article The difference in content between the American CNN and CNN International for instance Most articles dont start off fullsize and we shouldnt expect that from this article within 10 mins of its existence
