Re My photos et al 

Elf

You asked about the photos I added  All of them were taken by me and all that I add in the future will be taken by me  So please know that Wikipedia can use them as per the licensing agreement I read and signed off checked off on  Thanks for letting me know about the request for photos  I have lots to share and will start with the Merchandise Mart in Chicago
