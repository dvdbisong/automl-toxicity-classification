Ace Combat 3 moving 

Hi JamesofUR Regarding your recent denial of the move request you might want to be careful with letting that guy do as he wants around here Hes also the head admin of the Acepedia an Ace Combat fan wiki where hes amassed quite a reputation for being too dictatorial with the content there and even players in Ace Combatrelated Facebook groups are irritated with this Such a distinction can smack of COI in many cases  I wouldnt be surprised if the wiki contained much of the content our editors deleted from the various Ace Combat articles here years ago Thanks for hearing me out
