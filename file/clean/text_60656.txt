Thanks for getting back to me Like on many pages a consensus will never form unless people who have a fairly objective take on affairs decide to leave the page to the POV pushers This page like many pages of strong national interest to certain users will forever be a battleground Im sure youve seen it elsewhere as well  there is a cadre of users who post on one topic only and large numbers of them congregate around a topic of interest They post a certain perspective on the topic and basically exert ownership over the topic People who come in and see what might be considered to be bias and try to change the page are quickly overwhelmed Even when they are not and achieve some sort of compromise after a long struggle sooner or later a new account will arrive and undo the consensus  This is exactly what happened here Of course its even worse when two interest groups who are hostile to each other try to gain control of a topic of interest  then its world war III  Im sure youve seen that too

This is what has happened on this page and others relating to preIslamic Iran a topic of considerable passion to many Iranian emigres in particular  Many of the users who post regularly on these topics post about Iranian topics and Iranian topics only  It is an uphill battle to get some of the evident POV bias removed and when it is surely enough along comes a new account do undo the cease fire  The unfortunate thing is just how easy it is for wikipedia pages to be owned in this way the result being that the page reads like propaganda
