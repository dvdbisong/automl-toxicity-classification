A more important point about Vuia is that he has no witnesses or evidence whatsoever for his wild claim All reports of this flight are based on his unsubstantiated claims Even if his fairy tale is taken seriously it includes the admission that it was so windy on the day of his alledged hop that after he landed his plane was picked up by a gust of wind and slammed into some trees so the idea that he flew without the aid of the wind is contradicted by his own story On other occasions when he attempted to fly he was witnessed failing in his attempts by journalists but later claimed that the flights were sucessful Hes just another pathetic liar like Coanda  
And his claimed hop was years after longer well documented hops made by at least 5 others in powered aircraft
