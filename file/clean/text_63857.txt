Im not sure if See also sections are supposed to have descriptions for the links they provide but in this case I think little descriptions wont hurt Ie nonbelievers for one will find a link to Luthers Small Catechism odd especially since that article doesnt mention Bach Would you be so kind to add a few small clarifications Ie something like Luthers Small Catechism the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule assuming it was Thomasschule as I have no idea instead of a simple link Also Christian symbolism in Bachs works is certainly an interesting topic and it is already mentioned in the Style section Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach and then wed have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bachs work For now though the article is already way too large and has to grow larger as there are few inline citations the References section is underdeveloped etc
