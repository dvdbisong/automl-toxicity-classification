 What I am getting at is that it appears from my observations that the your work will be mercilessly edited rule is used as a reason to revert someone elses editing of your the ruleciters work Example Joe writes text Jane mercilessly edits Joes text Joe offended reverts Janes edits back to Joes original text Jane seeing all of her work deleted objects Joe replies Hey if you cant take the heat stay out of the Kitchen and condescendingly points out to Jane who is quite familiar with the rules btw Welcome to Wikipedia please read the rules particularly the one that says your work will be mercilessly edited preempting Janes justification of her work by such citation which she thought was implicit anyway There you have it How to cite the mercilessly edited rule  1645
