The source of Jan Dlugosz 

I would like this source to be added to the article

The Annals of Jan Dlugosz ISBN 1901019004 page 593 AD 1476

The Bessarabian soldiers who share a language and customs with the Walachians and know their secrets and domestic affairs are able to inflict more damage on them than can the Turks

Note Dlugosz refers to Moldavians as Walachians and sometimes will mention The Voivode of Moldavias Walachians while the southern Wallachians of Wallachia are mentioned as Bessarabians and their country as Bessarabia Sometimes however Moldavians are called just Moldavians Dlugosz was talking about the Battle of Baia
