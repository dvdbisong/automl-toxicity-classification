future tense 

This article has a lot of saying that suchandsuch will happen Aside from the fact that we cannot predict with certainty whether the work will be successfully completed as planned it is also a maintenance headache because it means that even if everything does go to plan the article will need constant revisiting to change future to past tenses at the right time I think it is better to talk about what was proposed in the past a completed event that we can report on than what will happen in the future Ive changed a couple of bits but there is more to do Thanks
