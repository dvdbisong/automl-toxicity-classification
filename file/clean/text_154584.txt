Of Oldwindybear and Orderinchaos  the second still an administrator despite welldocumented and indisputably abusive sockpuppetry  it is obvious enough to whose request you are responding The evidence of Oldwindybears socking has been linked from several blogs and should not be blanked under any circumstances Id go so far to say that that OWB himself would agree This is a technical lesson on how to perform proper sock identifications The other Im afraid speaks to the corruption and double standards of Wikipedia justice  administrators can get away with long term egregious abuses with only a warning so long as the thinnest pretense of innocence is provided the gay lovers defense which no one really believes Forget most administrators most contributors have more integrity than this Please do not blank my userspace pages again FT2
