Hello and Sorry 
Hello Alison I was unblocked for good behavior and wanted to tell you I am sorry for what happened in the past

Quoting Benjamin Franklin Insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results I had everyone telling me the same repetitve phrases over and over again asking them what they meant and not understanding because they said the same thing and expected me to understand it is not like I am asking to hear it again because this is on a screen I could read it again without having to ask Peter 

Like you told me to assume good faith and I took that as a passive verb subject is object of verb that you were telling me to assume good faith on my behalf and I asked what you meant and you pretty much just repeated yourself Obviously not saying you are insane but it was an insane way of trying to communicate with me I am also autistic which makes communication even harder Peter
