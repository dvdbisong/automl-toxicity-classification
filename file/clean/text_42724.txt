I agree with Jaakobu I replaced the lead because I could not find one article where someone tried to hide another transliteration later in the article and after reviewing the page history I can only conclude that there is some goal to create a weight in one direction or the other by those seeking the removal of the transliteration I too would like to see some sourcing for the handwaving claim that it is an arabic word over and over again Just because you repeat a claim over and over does not make it so that is merely Proof by assertion
