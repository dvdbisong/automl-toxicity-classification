Edits to this page 

I noticed that very recently a lot of wellreferenced information has been deleted from this articles page I am wondering what readers might think about restoring some of those deletions  as they provide everyday contexts analogies semantics examples etc that help to better explain the content of the article to a general readership  as the deletions that were made might limit the use of the article to experts in the field Also the deletions remove the psychologysocialscience aspect of the article Would anyone be adverse to restoring some of the deleted content
