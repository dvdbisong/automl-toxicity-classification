Thats right  Why is that senseless division of one language to all those politically created standards when they are 98 to 99 identical in all linguistical aspects Everyone normal can see that fact by looking at the chart in the article where the 3 standards are compared There are just a few words that are different which is even far under the level of being 3 dialects of a same language Theres absolutelly NO translations between serbian TV shows or movies that are broadcasted on bosnian and croatian TV and viceversa And there will never be translations because its same language On the contrary there are and will be translations when one of the SerboCroatian standards is translated to the viewers in Slovenia or Macedonia and viceversa because in this case its a matter of 2 different languages
Not accepting the facts that SerboCroatian is ONE language is a totally pathetic behavior limited to the extreme nationalists especially from the western part of this language speaking area They are totally isolated always fighting unsuccessfully with the rest of the world and their failed propaganda is dying every coming day The majority of Croatians Bosnians and Serbians are thanks God normal people who are absolutelly aware that they are speaking a SAME language which is by some suspicious political reasons called either serbian croatian bosnian dalmatian montenegrin or bunjevac Those are the facts and no oposite comment can change them Regards to you Tsf and to all the majority of normal people on these pages 2486116250
