A request 

Just completed the latest lesson for the VC  Would you proofreadedit it please

BTW Ive looked over your contributions again  Your participation in deletion debates is good

The main objection in your RfA was Lack of policy experience  The basic reasoning is that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them so if youve read the policies and guidelines that would show up in your contributions  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves  With policies unless it is fixing grammar or typos you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval  but that becomes habit after you get used to it  So my advice is that you start proofreading the PGs and see where that takes you  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you  Before you accept another nom you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs s some mediation etc  Then ask
