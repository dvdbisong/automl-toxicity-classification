WHAT are you talking about The High Court found as a FACT and a RULING that my dad IS a lawyer and IS entitled to a number of issues the least the right of audience A finding of fact The Crown tried to appeal and were REFUSED They had to pay costs That is it Why you wish to try and go beyond such is beyond me and it would appear all others If it irks you that dad is a lawyer who practises worldwide then that is your problem Dont inflict it upon others my dad has a million and one faults but being a lawyer is NOT one of them If you want to blacken him as it seems you do I and my brothers and sister can certainly tell you his faults But for all his faults he is a great dad always there notwithstanding he is away a lot and has done his best showing us love affection and given us security despite his personal life He is in Iraq a lot he has access to HVD High Value Detainees represents Tariq Aziz just managed to release Humad Humadi even certain presidents dont get near Camp Cropper If dad was not a lawyer do you think he would have access to the highest level of security in the world Or maybe he is a spy or something I guess that will be your next suggestion if you want scandal about dad find it elsewhere not where you are looking MSDS
