threats 

The comment was deleted for the reason I said  I didnt want distraction on the mediation  So lets do this here  

I think you think you are being much cuter than you are  Stay within wikipedias rules and the ferocious hatred I have for you will not find outside expression  Keep provoking me on this forum and it will  I didnt come into your life and do damage you came into mine  You seem to feel perfectly free to attack me degrade me and demean me   You have no remorse no conscience  There is a constant undercurrent of trickery and dishonesty it just about everything you write    If you were genuinely spooked you would be polite  You arent spooked this is just one more stupid side show trick of yours    And if you do genuinely feel a little spooked good you should  You have crossed way over the line  

Keep your dialogue to a minimum and keep it on topic  I dont want to hear about your assessment of me on various forums  You need to learn some manners   Your rude snarky personal attacks have on wikipedia and given our history is a very bad idea for you in general     Talk
