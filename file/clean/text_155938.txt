No I dont see what you mean There is no POV in the Article If you want my POV here in the discussion page then yes I have a POV and the POV is that Regional Governments in Ontario are the most corrupt governments outside of the Third World and ANY politicial who supports them past present or future is CORRUPT especially those in the Provincial Government level that keep them around so long and that includes members of all THREE political parties CORRUPTION spans partisanship and it a completely personal matter This is my POV but I do not put this in the Article My Agenda is to publish truthfull information and if that goes against the PROPAGANDA of corrupt government so be it You are free to add interesting information to balance good with bad if you can find anything GOOD to say about Regions in Ontario which I doubt anyone can since they are only good for nothing but institutionalized form of corruptionWiki BADASS Woo 2U
