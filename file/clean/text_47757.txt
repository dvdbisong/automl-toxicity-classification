Hey 

Hi I understand your block but can you tell me if you used the same criteria for the user who was always reverting the edits Just wondering I have been editing here since 2007 creating articles and greatly improving some already existing pages and I was never blocked I am editing on Wikipedia most of the time even when Im on my little free time at work Did you check on that before you blocked me I really am found of Wikipedias principles saying that all knowledge show be free and available to all So please the next time you have problems with my editings and if I say rude things to annoying users may them be anonymous or registered on Wikipedia consider what I just said Thanks for your attention
