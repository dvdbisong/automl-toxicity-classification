Just a few thoughts

I dare say the article overall is rather biased though Id point out 1 instance where it understates its case the burning of churches in Spain started before the Civil War  was 1 of its causes
AC does seem to be largely antiCatholic Its been said somewhere that you tend to get AC in Catholic countries secularism in Protestant ones I think OR the idea is that the Catholic Church has quite definite views resulting in increasing tensions between it  modern secular society Socalled mainstream Protestant churches tend to get wishywashy  adopt secular values a lot of the time
