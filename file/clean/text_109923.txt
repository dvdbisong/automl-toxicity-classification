That one anonymous editor 

Thanks for your help with that anonymous user particularly in reverting the edits on my user page  I removed the refimprove templates on both the Kent Ohio and Theodore Roosevelt High School Kent Ohio articles because they really arent needed  Both articles can still be improved in many ways but they both are wellsourced  Their placement was done in spite not for any actual encylcopedic reason or concern over content  It seems that when editors particularly new editors get in a disagreement with me their solution is to edit the pages I edit the most  Same thing happened with a newer editor who edited the Akron Ohio article a little while back if you remember  I feel the latest edits particularly what was placed on your and my talk pages and in my user page could be considered Harassment    
Oh its definitely harassment and the antiMormon tone to it makes me sad even though Im not LDS  I actually considered posting this to WPANI probably will if the editor persists
