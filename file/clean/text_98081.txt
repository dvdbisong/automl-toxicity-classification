The present state of the description of Perebooms views is a joke The old article on the Dilemma of determinism explained it better
quote from Pereboom As has often been pointed out such random physical events are no more within our control than are causally determined physical events and thus we can no more be morally responsible for them than in the indeterminist opinion we can be for events that are causally determined The whole dichotomistic argument ie the one basing on the analysis of the extent of determinism and lack of determinism here aptly called randomness is missing in this version of Free will Thats why an edit like mine should be included If you dislike mine please suggest which words should be changed and what is the wording that you can accept I guess an admin sold this topic for cash so I am now more careful editing
