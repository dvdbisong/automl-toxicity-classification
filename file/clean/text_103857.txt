Thanks Graham it might not be necessary to do EVERY sentence but doing some of them would improve it because as of now it reads like original research that someone has just written out with just an odd ref here and there scattered within the text body Also what do you think to that list of 22 points characteristics of a profession I think much of that is excess baggage andor dubious or at best rather inapplicable as sweeping generalisations for ALL professionsmaybe it can be condensed down and again referenced  thanks Peter morrell
