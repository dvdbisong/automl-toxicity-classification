Hi the edits you made were reverted as there was no explanation for their removal If you feel that the edits need to be carried out then that is fine but you need to ensure there is an explanation given in the edit summary box the one beneath the editing box before you save your edit This will reduce the chance your edits are mistaken for vandalism most unexplained content removal is done with negative intent Hope that makes sense  TC
