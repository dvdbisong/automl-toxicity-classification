Well its understandable not wanting the infobox to be overfilled with info As for the family spouses and children have around as much impact on decisions as religion so why include that And for politicians most of them are married and have kids so it would do well to include this info either for all or just the few that are divorced or single And as for the alma mater section I believe its essential to display what degrees they earned as alma mater is just what schools were attended and could confuse readers I hope we can compromise on this  Whatd I do this time
