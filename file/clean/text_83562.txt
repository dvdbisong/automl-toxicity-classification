Shiny Toy  Guns 

Ive been trying to add Shiny Toy Guns onto the list for quite some time and every time I add them it is deleted  There is no doubt that STG are alternative just about every music source there is classifies them as indiealternative  Im going to keep putting them on the list no matter how many times it gets deleted until someone can provide me with a good explanation as to why they dont belong on it  Preceding unsigned comment added by 74476123   

Their wiki page lists them as indieelectronica and their official site describes them as electronica indie rock Indie and alternative are NOT the same thing and electronica while not actually a real genre is also not alternative You also tend to add them in with a flurry of other nonalternative mainstream crap poprock that dont belong on the list like Paramore and Fall Out Boy They stay off Stop adding them   

Okay but FYI I never added Paramore or Fall Out Boy
