Go over to the Vladimir Lenin page and remove the photos of the bodies arguing Lenin did not carry out these acts himself and see if the consensus supports your view  You could also go over to the Karl Hermann Frank page and complain that the article portrays the subject as a baby killer because of the imagery included  The fact of the matter is that your nowhere claim is simply false  Where must be and is assessed on an article by article basis  In this case the civilian deaths consequent to Harris policy is a nontrivial issue with respect to Harris and his legacy  You state here that Harris policy should be disagreed with on the basis of targets being too strongly defended etc ie without reference to the issue of civilian casualties  The fact of the matter is that there IS an issue  WPNPOV means a full and frank presentation not a whitewash  I should think that such a presentation should be possible without the WPCENSORship you demand  Ive already tried to accommodate your concerns with respect to the prominence this is given but I take it you are unwilling to entertain any compromise  I would invite you to consult WikipediaAssume good faith and consider the possibility that I am interested in making Wikipedia more informative and encyclopedic as opposed to dirtying anyone
