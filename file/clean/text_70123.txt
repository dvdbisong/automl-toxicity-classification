Metal Gear 1s final battle

After Big Boss activated the bases selfdestruct countdown the two of them engaged in oneonone combat with Big Boss fighting using the same Patriot machine gun he had received from The Boss in their own final confrontation decades earlier

This sounds to me a lot like fanon even though it seems like what Kojima would do there is absolutely no way to confirm what weapon Unknown uses other than a machine gun And dont talk about the infinite ammo eitherMachine Gun Kid the Shotgunner Arnold and Coward Duck all have infinite ammo because of the gameplay mechanics 

I took care of it Besides Big Boss left the Patriot on Boss grave   1358 Apr 15 2005 UTC
