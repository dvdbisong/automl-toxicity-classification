This is an excellent article and a valid subject and deleting it is an absurd idea 
There are many sources that support the validity of an article on Military Kids as an identifiable subculture 

1 See the awardwinning book by Mary Edwards Wertsch Military Brats Legacies of Childhood Inside the Fortress 

2 See the awardwinning documentary Brats Our Journey Home by Dona Musil it won 19 awards 

3 See numerous novels released in the last several years on the Military Brat experience 

4 See the Oscar Nominated movie The Great Santini based on the book by the same name by Pat Conroy

No one of these works alone could represent the whole military brat experience but they altogether point to the existence of a huge identifiable subculture commonly known as Military Brats
