ACTA Deletion 

I have left a comment on the articles deletion page I have to look at the page objectively and with strict reference to Wikipedias policies and guidelines Please do have a read of these guidelines Notability and referencing are indeed an issue and the discussion about deletion is in my view perfectly justifiable While ACTA is a vocal group with a significant amount of opposition it is also a very small group Please do try to remain objective  talk
