thanks for stopping by in Dixon New Mexico 

and making it if not a better place to live at least a better place to visit on wikipedia  We are indeed an unincorporated village though a village nonetheless which is why I spent the last week or so at the Embudo Valley Library book sale  We get no local taxes for the library  Perhaps more than you want to know but its too late now  in any case I appreciate your improvements here
