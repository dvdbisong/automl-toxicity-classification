Perceptions of cuteness 

I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about  However I do have a real criticism

The line here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans and perhaps juvenile animals in general cute should definitly either expound on the alludedto good reasons or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained

I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article

In any case the Every time you masturbate joke should be removed It was popular among internet humorists for a while but not really worthy of note outside of its own article also it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article

Any thoughts
 
Hey i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page who really cares i hope yas rnt losing sleep over itn i dunt mean to sound like a biotch but its boring to read about all the complaints and the point of the board is to write about catskittens atleast thats what the impression i got  could b wrong though anon

The reference to the Every time you masturbate joke should be removed It does nothing to enhance the article And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia a parent has to answer questions about masturbation Its offensive if nothing else  

In response to the first anon this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved Some offtopic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive
In response to Wabazana Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors However I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references Ive boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty which was already in see also which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader  

Lovely though it is is perceptions of cuteness really encyclopaedic   
Well its interesting Its written in a neutral point of view And as regards verifiability if kittens are cute isnt common knowledge then I dont know what is So yes I for one think its encyclopaedic   T  C  A  

I read about the perceptions of cuteness discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal Wed August 15th edition and was thrilled The cuteness of kittenscats is one of my favorite subjects to the annoyance of everyone who knows me I do agree with another posters comment that the pics of the kittens on this page arent necessarily the best Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ  httpcommonswikimediaorgwikiImagePj_blindsjpg
I believe when one sets hisher eyes on this image there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens Earnest t bass is legendary and also a good example
