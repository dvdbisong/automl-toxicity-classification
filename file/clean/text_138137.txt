There is no rule in Wikipedia to say we have to discuss first before we can edit the article Wikipedia says Be bold when editing the page Yours is against this rule Besides you also remove changes or do changes without discussing first This is a double standard I found no official source in Wikipeida which says BadVistaorg has been officially blacklisted or flagged as bad source Judging on your own liking is against WPNPOV  

Im going to move this part of discussion on the right page
