At WPDRN we volunteers have a fairly broad discretion within DRN to do whatever we think will best resolve the conflict we have that freedom because we have zero authority and you can freely ignore us and in my considered opinion the combination of you filing the dispute with a nonexistent article name you filing as an IP when you have a user name and the preliminary reaction of the other editors named led me to believe that the dispute would be more likely to be resolved if you refiled with the right article name and with you logged in

As for the rights of IP users vs logged in users yes editing semiprotected articles is one difference neither group can edit fully protected articles but that is not the only difference See WikipediaIPs are human tooWhat an unregistered user cant do for a complete list

In your case the problem is not the IP but rather editing under two different accounts logged in and not logged in When registered users sign out of their accounts and contribute under their IP address it makes it difficult to see their true editing history Because of this I am asking you to please sign in before filing DRN disputes
