As much as you deserve to be slapped with a boxful of WPCIVIL WPNPA and WPAGF wet noodles for the obscene comments and others cited above Ill forego the often juvenile Wikipenalties merrygoround and simply request that you in the future refrain from either obscenely or prosaically in any way associating me with the noxious criminal enterprise that is the subject of the article where your comments appeared And while Im temporarily acting grown up I should add that IMHO you and Berlet are barking up a very wrong tree with the whole coded discourse hidden meanings business and are unwittingly hopefully lending credence to the far more noxious aspects of that enterprise by going off on that tangent You cannot verify the claims and as such yuo will lose that debate and by virtue of losing lend credibility to aspects of that organization as well as it propagandistic persecution complex motifs far beyond its semiotics I would stick to the many more obvious creepy things The gibberish Im afraid is simply gibberish Intentional I dont know But its what it appears to me they love having you focus on Now back to the usual childishness Cheers
