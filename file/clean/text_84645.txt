Re Brandi Carlile page
Ive been told by one of the admins on the AgainToday forum that you are part of Brandis management team I was told by one of the admins last night to change her page again after the copyright issue If you want to change it back to your previous revisions thats fine Ill be glad to leave it alone from now on I had just noticed the obvious similarities between the wiki page and the myspace page and wiki has clear rules on copyright infringement Sorry if I came off a little harsh
