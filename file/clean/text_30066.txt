Others have reinstated my close twice now which Im perfectly fine with  Im more than willing to defend the close if need be  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbos page  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus  Thus an RfC was opened  Once the RfC was opened which is calling for a wider community input then the RfC should have run  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Clas stance but it wasnt  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened  Unfortunately having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places  This MfDs action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another I wouldnt have closed it  But it is clear that no consensus exists and that the proper venue is the RfC where wider input can be obtained Poppa Balloon
