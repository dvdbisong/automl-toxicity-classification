Irish peers
Hi BHG I noticed your edit to the sequence boxes of Lawrence Parsons 2nd Earl of Rosse and as I had created Postmasters general of Ireland wondered if those appointees should have a box too I have very slowly been working on a draft of Charles Coote 1st Earl of Bellomont and perhaps he needs some boxes too Any help appreciated in that way either directly or guideance or other material I could use Thanks
