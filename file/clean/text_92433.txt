I dont have the time or interest to get deeply involved in this article  It seems to have been a battleground for those wishing to ridicule birthers and the birthers themselves  But I will say this if you compare the WSJ piece to a lot of the sources in this article it seems quite neutral  Looking at the lead alone footnotes 8 11 and 14 look pretty opinionated to me  And note that I used intext attribution for the WSJ piece as is commonly done for other opinion sources later in this article but you removed the intext attribution
Anyway rather than become a bigger  target for relentless charges of POV quotemining and all the rest which I think would be more aptly hurled at much of the existing text in this article Ill not reply further  Im not betting that Chris Matthews will be mentioned for long in this article
