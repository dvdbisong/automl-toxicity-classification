Legal Action 
Wikipedia has a policy WPNLT and I agree with it completely However they do add the following 

If you must take legal action we cannot prevent you from doing so However it is required that you do not edit Wikipedia until the legal matter has been resolved to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels You should instead contact the person or people involved directly by email or through any other contact methods the user provides

That makes a lot of sense So please provide me with some contact so that I can contact you directly in order to iron this out For me you can contact me at johnjohnclarkprosecom Ill be glad to hear from you SchroCat Also Cassianto MisterShiney Dr Blowfeld Bencherlite and Delicious carbunkle The rules sensibly provide for that course so I know you will be happy to abide by it and I will be happy to hear from one and all of you   
What on earth are you talking about Youre the one throwing around the accusations and have yet to provide evidence If  you are wanting to take legal action you need to contact wikipedia direct
