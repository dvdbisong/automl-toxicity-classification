Oooh Youre wrong Youre wrong Youre wrong  Why am I not impressed by your debate skills 
First until 3 weeks ago I had never heard the term meat puppet   Perhaps youre trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean no more and no less  Shades of Alice in Wonderland I suppose  I will have to find the definition of that term  But I view it as a problem when selfselected biased individuals even if there is no actual coordination involved seem to coordinate their postings  Dodo ran away thats a fact  He didnt address my actual criticisms of his actions  he simply threw a few templates as if that was the end of the argument  But those templates were not merely misapplied they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute  Dodo couldnt be bothered to address them and for a good at least for him reason  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct and debate the propriety not merely of the original post but also his own misdeeds then Dodo would be so busy he couldnt continue his driveby reversions of peoples articles  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits repeatedly  He was unwilling to explain why he didnt wait for consensus  Etc
And it is a fact that nobody addressed Dodos at least arguable misconduct even if hypothetically they also objected to something I did too  Why should that be  Theres an excellent reason  I think the kind of people who did post selfselected of course one would expect may very well have felt they were defending one of their own  I repeat my point that if I had time and access to reversiondeletion statistics it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo Revert Revert Revert   And not to bother with any consensus  We dont need no stinkin consensus  Such persons would be fearful of outing Dodos pattern of action and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism  Am I wrong  I invite somebody else to study their statistics and explain why theres no pattern there
