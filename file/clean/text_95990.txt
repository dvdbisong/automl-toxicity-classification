Accuracy
Can anyone comment on the accuracy of this movie in depicting the Maya as heavily involved in human sacrifice which was esp used by the Aztecs not the Maya

If error that would be typical Gibson gibberish and blurring histoyr as he
did eg in Braveheart depicting all normal country side Scots as hugely filthy and starving all inaccurate 
and in Passion blurring history again to depict huge flaying of Christs skin on and on which has no known documentation except surely he WAS beaten severely  just not mostly entirely deflayed of his skin which would hae killed hiim before the cross  all Gibson gibberish  intened to use massively sadism to make a buck 

Art or SM Porn
Is it ART for a monkey to make movies to appeal to the publics 
fascination with sadism and gruesome tortures as Wm Wallaces being
hung drawn and quarted in Braveheart
