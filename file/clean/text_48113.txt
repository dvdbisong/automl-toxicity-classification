Firstly it isnt up to me to do your research for you Its your information that you seem determined to insert prominently near the top of the article so the burden is on you to provide proper cited sources for it I already made my contribution I prefer to just jettison the entire paragraph as I already did or at least move it somewhere much lower in the article Secondly some of the stuff you just mentioned are still various rock critics giving their own opinions of obvious influences To say Coldplay is influenced by Oasis we need a source with an actual band member stating words to this effect Thirdly why is it so important to you to devote so much time space and effort to Coldplays influences and why is it important enough to be so near the top of the article
