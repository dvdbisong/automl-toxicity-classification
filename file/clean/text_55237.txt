Looks like the criticism content has been removed again and replaced with solely an environmental impact section There are other issues besides environmental ones A study done by some British company found that aviation primary RADAR systems have difficulty handling windfarms as the constantly rotating turbines cause the RADAR to pick up an intrusive object There are complex ways of eliminating this problem but at the moment it is being cited by aviation safety organisations that wind farms pose a significant risk to their industry I would also argue that the title is misleading as the intermittent nature of wind and the economic cost of wind turbines are not environmental issues
