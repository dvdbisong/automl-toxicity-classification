This single sentence suggests that Fred is the salvation that all gun owners seek  This is not right  Fred Thompson has a mixed record on gun control even voting to silence grass roots gun rights groups by making it Federal Crime for them to publish incumbents gun voting records leading up to an election  Fred is not entirely progun and all that I am trying to do is highlight this simple fact for our readers so that they know to read further into his political positions page before they draw any conclusion  This page is not the Fox News spin machine and does not belong to the Fred Thompson Campaign  Therefore it is my intention to right this wrong  If you are pro Fred I suggest you help us correct this before we force a complete rewrite of this spin machine  Again this has nothing at all to do with criminal records  This statement is merely your spin attempt to deflect the issue and leave readers confused thinking that Fred is always progun except when it involves a criminal  This is not the full factual history of Fred and we will correct this if you do not take it upon yourself to do so  The clock is ticking tick tock
