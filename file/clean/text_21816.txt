Actually the link that you just referred to has been updated like this in red letters in the link The Green Papers has revised its soft count of the 40 Republican National Convention delegates from MINNESOTA as follows
The 24 Congressional District delegates formally boundpledged to presidential contenders up through Sunday 22 April 2012 and already hard counted on this website are now soft counted as follows
        Ron Paul 20
        Rick Santorum 2
        Uncommitted 2
The 13 atlarge delegates not yet formally boundpledged to presidential contenders these will be formally boundpledged as a result of the Minnesota Republican STATE CONVENTION on Saturday 19 May 2012 are now softcounted per the results of the 7 February Precinct Caucuses proportionally among each presidential contender receiving at least 5 of the caucus vote as follows
        Rick Santorum 6 451 of 13 586
        Ron Paul 4 272 of 13 353
        Mitt Romney 2 169 of 13 220
        Newt Gingrich 1 108 of 13 140
In addition 1 of the 3 Party leaders has indicated support for Newt Gingrich
The total soft count of GOP delegates from Minnesota is therefore now
        Ron Paul 24 20  4
        Rick Santorum 8 2  6
        Mitt Romney 2
        Newt Gingrich 2 1  1
        Uncommitted 2
        available 2

Also that same link says much farther down Atlarge delegates may be bound on the first ballot unless released by the candidate if directed by the state convention
