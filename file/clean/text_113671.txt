Perro Aguayo Jr death
Okay I think I added a good source to indicate that Aguayo was indeed bleeding from the eyes during his match Also youre right Manik didnt notify Mysterio but Mysterio himself saw it and stopped the 619 from connecting because of what happened 

If thats still not good enough I promise I wont mess with the page again7219897205  0952 12 July
