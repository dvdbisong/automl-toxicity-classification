CurtisNaitos article edits are a disruptive and in the last few months he has been campaigning for me to get banned from Wikipedia for criticizing these edits He has managed to sneak several poorlysourced articles past the GA process and these articles should be reassessed in accordance with the GA criteria All the other users who have commented on the issue will agree with me My offering to not request these reassessments if CurtisNaito stops following me and harassing me was a peace offering not a threat  聖やや
