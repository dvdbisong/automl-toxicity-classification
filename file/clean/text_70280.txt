Oppenheimer
Hi Im currently reading ppenheimers book Its excellent he has a comprehensive iblyography and notes and uses previously published peer reviewed scientific papers It has a very comprehensive feel to it I havent read Sykes book yet but looking at the appendices and index it doesnt have the sort of comprehensive or academic feel of Oppenheimers work Still we can cite both and I suspect there will be many areas of agreement All the best Oppenheimer certainly argues strongly for the Iberian origin of most people from the British Isles though he mentions a paleolithic contribution from the Balkan refuge to England
