Allysons view is indeed wellworded and based on the attempts of many others in both long form and short form to define the term  Many anthropologists believe theres no way to strictly operationalize the term but that it points to a collection of social facts that need to be pointed to including female infanticide female mutilation female slavery women bought and sold unconsenting marriages etc etc  The problem is  does the article want to stick to this more theoretical level who defined the word in the lead or close to the top or does it also want to talk about what patriarchy is and that it may have preexisted any terms applied to it  Difficult subject  I too applaud the earlier editors for giving it a go it needs to be in Wikipedia its just very hard to edit
