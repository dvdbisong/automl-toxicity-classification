For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 623 KJV NIV says life in with a footnote saying or through For as in Adam all die so as in Christ all will be made alive 1 Corinthians 1522 NIV

That is a good point about John Locke I do know who he is hes even taught in our local middle school just by the way haha he was very influential but he was a philosopher not a theologian Many church goers whether selfidentifying Christians or not and many selfidentifying Christians whether churchgoers or not do not believe in original sin I have no idea how many or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups However original sin is a biblical doctrine Babies going to hell because they were not baptised however is not The Bible is not very specific about that issue It is a Catholic doctrine yes but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article The Protestant stance is that babies both born and unborn whatever they do are not held accountable until the age of accountability or the age of reason at which point they know the difference between right and wrong Roman Catholicism also holds this idea so Im wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin They have their inherited sinful nature original sin sure but thats different from actually committing a sin Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell whether or not theyve actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life Honest question here Im not trying to bash the Catholic Church
