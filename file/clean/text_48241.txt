I just have to say that although afghanistan can in certain contexts be considereed south asian it cannot be considered part of the indian subcontinent Also why is persian listed under languages twice And why is dari and persian listed separately dari is a form of persian It would be more accurate to just write persian And the first article that I wrote was informative and wasnt an act of vandalism
