Could someone please make the discussion about comparing medical vs veterinary school admissions more concise  I have lived in two states Michigan and California  In both there were many medical schools and only one veterinary school  Doesnt this fact alone mean that vet schools admissions are more difficult  Is this the result of boards of medicine limiting the numbers

I once remarked to my dentist that I was considering relocating to California as had one of my colleagues had done submitting her nursing school transcripts and board scores nationally administered and when I was licensed passing score was 350except California and New York where it was 450 and being licensed under most state nursing boards reciprocity policy  My dentist remarked that he could not move to California since the board of dentistry in that state decided that there were too many dentists there already 

Income

If we are comparing human vs animal physicians shouldnt there be some comparison of the cost of their educations including the amount of government subsidies at the colleges and relative incomes
