No More
I will no longer be vandalizing Wikipedia or its userpages I have being doing so for months mostly because seeing my vandalism or that of others was funny as hell User X got swallowed by a Wale is hilarious come on and to punish admins who I felt  My non constructive edits were done out of boredom especially those  containing racial slurs I am not racist in fact I am racially mixed myself 

I started editing on Wikipedia specifically the U of  L page mainly out of a cold war that developed betw myself  U of Ls marketing director which escalated after I was featured in the Herald Leader critising his marketing of U of L   
I wanted to show President Ramsey how to market the New U of L and Wikipedia was my penpad to this end 

My vandalism started after a edit conflict over the Courier Journals sports and editorial coverage where my what I felt were legitment edits on the page for CJ critism were removed and I was blasted After another CJ my account was blocked  

Prior to this I had many good edits on KY related pages which I am proud of I feel that my work here is now complete and I will only edit in exiting new facts I find out or breaking news  The Louisville VandalUnemployed living in basementBrando03many others
