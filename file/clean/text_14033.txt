To all interested parties 
For those who are interested for the arguments the sockpuppet Khoikhoi who has created this article presents for the application of the NPOV tag and later even totally disputed tag without giving any reasons which is vandalism and a blatant violation of any rules is as follows
  because this article presents sentences as absolute fact that are backedup by Slovak sources

In other words the use of Slovak sources is considered POV by him although I have used the  currently best scientific demographic and etnogpraphic sources existing in this area 

Secondly I will restore all sourced information that has been deleted by another sockpuppet of the userArpad and futher attempts to remove such information will be treated according to wikipedia rules Further corrections of the text of this and the Magyarisation article for the relativisation of which this article has been explicitely created by user Khoikhoi will follow later on
