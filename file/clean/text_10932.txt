Editing problems Steer Wrestling 

Montanabw is making sweeping unsourced statements  statements that heshe is presenting as facts that everyone knows and thus need no sourcing Mbws profile page indicates heshe is a horse person living in Montana I think Mbws is approaching the subject with a proprietary bias and simply does not want a researched documented Animal Abuse in Rodeo controversy presented Mbw is minimizing my contributions while maximizing hishers Mbw is very slightly altering my contributions to reflect a this is an animal nut statement sort of thing In one contribution I named a veterinarian with work in rodeo and included her credentials and her professional observations Mbw reduced the contribution to a spokesman for an animal rights group So how come you are supporting someone who is actually damaging the article and coming down hard on someone who is trying to improve and cover all the bases in the discussion You should be telling Mbw the same thing you are telling me  if you dont want your material to be heavily edited then dont contribute Mbw is minimizing the Animal Abuse Controversy which is a valid point in the article and has its own little section within the article in order to sell her prorodeo agenda  claims of being neutral and balanced notwithstanding IMO Mbw should be balancing my points with hisher own researched and documented points Not editing mine to reflect hisher point Leave mine alone mine are researched documented and neutral
