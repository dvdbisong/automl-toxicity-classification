Moesian I didnt miss anything Just because it uses the word doesnt mean squat It says the Codex Zographensis is from Western Bulgaria With suitability I was referring to whether or not it sourced what you claim which it doesnt Again this isnt an issue of ethnicity Your saying the Ohrid Literary School was Bulgarian is not needed in this article Dont make this an issue of whether or not there was a Macedonian ethnicity in the middle ages
Laveol The term is used in a purely geographic sense being from this or that region etc From the absence of any sources the term West Bulgarian recension does not appear to be in current use On the contrary I would actually like to see term explained
Gligan It doesnt matter what Macedonian meant back then were discussing modern terminology A reader may also associate the Bulgarian recension with the modern Bulgarian state or even the Bulgars
