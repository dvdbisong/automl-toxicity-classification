Just remove it already
I didnt add it someone else did But yes he was placed on the cover in several countries He was the player chosen for this because the game has the national teams from countries and he was put on that for that reason For some reason people keep asking me about this and for proof of it and I am not even the one that added him on their on wiki even though it is true Im sick of getting these retarded messages so just delete all record of him being on their please Its just annoying to keep having people ask about this BTW on the licencse issue its the FIBA licence for the national teams thats why hes on their Notice hes wearing his national team jersey
