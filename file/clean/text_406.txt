Ive revised the translation from the Spanish by going back to this earlier edit  Subsequent edits on the Spanishlanguage Wikipedia seem to have been intended mainly to insert links but have primarily succeeded in deleting chunks of the original text rendering the result both ungrammatical and somewhat insensible  Ive taken s translation and incorporated the previously omitted text and gone over the whole to make it more idiomatic in English  Its not quite there yet but is hopefully now serviceable
