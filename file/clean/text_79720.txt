The article only covers what we know We dont know if Dylan still claims to be a Bornagain CHhristian or back to some form of nonChristian Judaism There is no proof either way if he is nonChristian Jew or a Christian Jew He has never said

A person can be a bornagain Christian and Jewish Messianic or Jewish Christian   Christians read the Torah the first five books of Old Testaament or Old Covenant or the Bible Some Messiaanic Jewish Christians even read the Jewish Tulmad and attend nonChristian Jewish services so even if he did these things it gives no clues as to his current religeous affiliation 962487243
