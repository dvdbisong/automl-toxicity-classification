Hi
Hey Ebyabe Look listen Im sorry about the way I acted towards you BMK and MarntteD I completely lost my temper there for a while I came out of retirement and I realize now that retiring from the wiki wont solve my problems I just couldnt understand that well about information Ive been getting and thats why I lost my temper at that point I came on the wiki 2 months ago because I want to make articles a lot better for everyone when they do research and I want to stop vandalism too that IP users put false information in articles I still feel a little guilty for the way I acted towards you guys and I want to let you BMK and MarntteD know that Im sorry because I didnt mean to lose my temper And I didnt mean for those things I said too So please I just want to bag from you please dont report me at all because Im sorry Im really sorry for the way I acted and I know leaving the wiki wont solve it at all it will only make it worse for me So I really hope you forgive me and I hope we can get a long a lot better now Have a good day
