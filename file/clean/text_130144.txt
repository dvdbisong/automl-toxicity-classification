Dougweller Be fair I was personally attacked beforehand by one of your own staffers check the archives by being asked If you want to get down in the weeds I didnt appreciate this licentious attack I assure you The same staffer accussed me of ignorance Not a very friendly way to be on a website which is meant to promote knowledge Much too hostile and aggressive At any rate you suggested that I start editing the article itself How is one to edit or contribute to the article itself when it is semiprotected
