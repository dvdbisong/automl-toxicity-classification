Thank you so much for the barnstar I appreciate it  It means a lot coming from you but you are much more deserving of one 

As for the water I chose that because Ive had problem finding the proper article myself  I was doing a chemistry assignment and the regular Water article wasnt as comprehensive as Water properties  But then I found out we even had articles on Water_data_page and Color of water which would have been very helpful had I known they existed
But we also dont have an outline for water so it may be better to demo a well developed outline  If you have any good ideas just go ahead and change it as you see fit
