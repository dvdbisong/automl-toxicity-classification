note I copied your reply here to keep this in one place  it gets too hard to follow if the discussion is spread around which is why I asked you to reply here in my note above  Thanks for replying  Glad we see eye to eye to at least a certain extent   I am sorry for the different messages you are getting but this place is what  a democracy an anarchy  Not sure but I am sure that it is a community where we work things out based on discussion based in turn on existing policies and guidelines which themselves were the result of discussion  My sense is that Ronz will agree with my thoughts on your username but well see    
Please calm down a bit  Your post on your userpage arguing about COI and your posts below are kind of blowing off steam angry is the wrong place for you to be  Here is the deal  we really really like and need experts here and I agree with you that the islamic finance articles need a lot of expert work and your work could be really valuable   What is not valuable and what raises concerns is you citing your own websites which a looks selfpromotional and violates the guideline WPSELFCITE and b violates WPSPS which is policy   Might you be willing to keep working but just not make references to your own websites   That would take care of everything  Would you do that  Thanks
