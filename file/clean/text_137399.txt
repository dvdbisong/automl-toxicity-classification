Use of the word stalker was not meant as an attack but a matter of fact  If you wish I will provide references privately to you but not on a public forum  However if that statement of fact appears to be an attack by others I will heed your wish and not mention that particular fact  On the contrary I would note there is no proof of the police report you speak of at all  As for allegations there is no room for all the allegations in many instances this being a prime example  To include them all would see this quickly turned into a gossip messageboard with allegations fflying back and forth filling many pages on many sides  The facts are all that matters  Again I quote We are not tabloid journalism we are an encyclopedia  The referenced article was written by one of the parties best friend and is CLEARLY labeled at the top of the page Celebrity Gossip  As is with any subject with disputed facts it is not an encyclopedias place to print each and every wild rumor or accusation only to publish facts after the dispute is settled and certainly so when living people are involved
