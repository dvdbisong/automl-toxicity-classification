Bugs youre best avoiding interaction with Factocop as he appears to only have a vindetta against the Irish language And those who support the Irish language are Irish_republicanismRepublicans by defacto Further any suitable arguement or reference you or many other editors bring to the forum are automatically ignored and as a result she asks the question again It is altogether very time consuming And Factocop please stop referring to me in every other edit Its becoming an obsession that I was blocked
