If you look at the history of this article you will notice that I am not the editor who did most of the edits I happened to just notice recently that the page was almost deleted  In any case I think still that a page should not be completed deleted without having it on the talk page the talk page does have a long history the recent editor just joined and delted ober 90 of the stuff I have not gone through the whole thing but I am sure there were edits which were clearly sourced  I will have to print the old article and go through it to determine which ones were not sourced  I agree if they were not sourced than they should be deleted but the ones which one editor may believe is not sourced according to his or her personal preference is clearly against wiki policy  It than becomes subjective

In reference to Ghulam Ahmad engineer I did go ahead and add the citations that the editor and you are referring to so there is nothing there that is not sourced now
