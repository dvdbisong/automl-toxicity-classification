I wanted to note that this only applies to 1010100 If googolplex means 1010100 then it would be a completely different number This is because what is inside the parenthesis needs to get evaluated first In this case it would be 101 followed by 100 zeroes By using a little bit of mathematical induction you can conclude that it has a googol amount of zeroes For instance 107 has 7 zeroes 1010000 has 10000 zeroes and therefore 1010100 has 10100 googol amount of zeroes But it seems like the article doesnt put the parenthesis
