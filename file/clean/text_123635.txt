Hello again

No im not Ashley Favel  i know someone who could very well be his younger brother but he and I are quite separate people After a quick glance across his page I can see why you considered us to be the same people 

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name For example a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member  Andy Thomas that is Several other events throughout time such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center  all were orchestrated by AUES members The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow local audience but when thought about they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub in the city being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable in my opinion

ahh have to run will continue this later

cheers
