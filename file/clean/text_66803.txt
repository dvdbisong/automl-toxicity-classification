The village pump discussion 

Im thinking of writing a HOWTO for Document Based Queries DBQ here Im particularly running into problems writing DBQs for an AP history class The HOWTO would be at HowTo write a DBQ

Maybe this should be put into wikibooks but I think it would be too hard to find   2220 13 Dec 2003 UTC

 I would say write an introductory material here about what a DBQ is where its used etc and link to the full howto which you write at wikibooks   Talk 2344 Dec 13 2003 UTC

But where would I write the How To I havent found a good obvious spot at    0001 14 Dec 2003 UTC

You might get an answer quicker if you ask at the Wikibooks Staff Lounge rather than here  0007 14 Dec 2003 UTC
