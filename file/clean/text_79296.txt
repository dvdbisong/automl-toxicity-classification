Maybe its time to look at your addiction honestly 

I think we need to seriously approach our work in this topic area and if the same folks are going to come here time and time again with some fight or another then they shouldnt be editing this topic WGFinley

Youve frequently made statements that the IsraeliArab conflict holds no special interest for you you are just fighting the Israeli Nationalists who cant get the policy right You frequently expand into Jewish topics like the ADL 

Why It seems you have a great investment in campaigning against all things Israeli and attacking any editor who you label as Zionist

You and your antiZionist gang even routinely spread lies on the AE boards to have your ways

Id expect that out of an Arab like Asad who was taught that lying to ones enemy is natural Id also expect that out of a wideeyed liberal who took some Middle Eastern classes at college like Tiamut

But you what do you have in this

What is your obsession
