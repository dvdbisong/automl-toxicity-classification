AE action for Urartu TH

Hello Penwhale I was a party to an AE action  where you have closed the discussion by noting that Urartu TH talk  contribs blocked by Sandstein for WPNPAWPAGF issues separate from original request which was not actionable  Penwhale 

I know that there generally exists a process by which one may appeal a block due to an Arbitration enforcement violation but what about this type of block As you noted I did not violate the Arbitration decision but ratheraccording to Sandsteinmade remarks that violated WPNPAWPAGF I disagree with Sandstein and would like to appeal Thank you  1345 17 March
