 Dispute with Dsmith1usa 

Hi Jc  Just wanted to leave you a quick comment regarding the dispute with UserDsmith1usa

Frankly its really not worth trying to reason with this guy Ive already tried several times but all he keeps doing is putting up this really elaborate prose that basically amounts to I know you are but what am I Its very trollish and I fully support any RFCU or other action you or any other admin might take in this case  I havent followed up on it myself because frankly Ive had better things to do     

In this case ignoring is probably the best course of action in this case so far And thanks for your perspective on this Ive been doing some reading of my own and am seeing a bit of a pattern In any case perhaps he will actually be true to his word an leave Wikipedia this time Well see   

Yes ignoring is probably the best course of action in these cases so far

Yall know  Ive been doing some reading of my own and am seeing a bit of a pattern In any case perhaps they will actually be true to their word Again sigh

I will be referring this dispute to a more appropriate forum and will no longer be involved in the dispute myself  KieferSkunk talk   

and leave this dispute  as I keep asking  alone this time Well see 

But you wont leave it will ya I dont think its in your nature

 If youre still around Id really like for you to explain in one small paragraph thats called egging it on KS

 n I take this as code for inconvenient truth

 not this drawnout mess of oneline responses to other peoples comments taken out of context

You remarkably when you came on the scene posed as a mediator as far as I can see There are others outside of me have asserted that you can pour the equivalent of gas on fires I have reminded you of this earlier

Later this year in November Friends over the UK are meeting in seminars on Building Harmony You would be most welcome to join us Perhaps you may see the world as not quite like you appear to want to view it

Apologies if you find the language elaborate I call it reasoning and trust me I find it just as difficult to reason with yall  being partial to Truth mself

Now  am I  finally  dismissed
