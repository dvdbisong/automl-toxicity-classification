I will say here that I agree with most of the terms especially the requirement for a source I will agree with all as I do not think saying especially Christianity was absurd So The Hybrid could you define the word absurd more rigourously I am satisified that most of my edits in Criticism of Pokemon was not deleted though although I still felt the need to emphasize the part about Christianity as that section is about Christians opinions of the Pokémon series I had a conflict with Brandon about not sourcing that part where I didnt say source my statement about religion not being mentioned in the cartoon but I do not think that has to be sourced as most of the members of PCP actually agrees that religion was never metioned I do feel however that is the only article one can talk about religion in an article about Pokémon With the exception of the word absurd I agree with the terms 

 Regarding the issue of ignoring me I will disagree with this I do feel that you should ignore me when I discuss religion in most Pokémon articles but if I am not doing that it could have detrimental consequences I agree with The_Hybrid that the religion things has gone on long enough ok 

 Do we all have an agreement Lets not engage in anymore vitriolic conduct ok
