Dear Ali saying Ismail claimed Royal Persian Descent does not seem to be correct Ismail as we know was radically Shiite and claimed descendance from Ali ibn Talib who wasnt Persian but Arab Also the royal Persian descent as its known in times of Safavis was from time of Sassanids who according to Islam were heretics and Ismail could not have possibly been proud of them If at all Ismail was a descendant of Akkoyunlu royalty
