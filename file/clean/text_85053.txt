1  I believe that the statement  students are issued an IB Certificate regardless of whether a student passes or fails the exam are your words I was quoting you This means that you seem to have quoted me as the originator when in fact I was quoting you

2 You say As to the 4 being considered passing in the article under Diploma Conditions right above Certificates it states IB considers a 4 a passing grade however a student may earn the IB Diploma and still have 1 HL failing grade and 2 SL failing grades Which article is this Just give me the reference or link There are lots of articles linked and I want to know which one you are referring to 

3 Furthermore continuing 2 above the quote you may be using is possibly from the Diploma conditions Let me reiterate There is no pass or fail on a certificate as far as I understand from the IB please show me a quote about certificates if you have one  NOT Diploma There is a pass and fail on the Diploma Failing the Diploma does not mean you pass or fail certificates
