Greg have just copyedited the quote in that footnote and in Criticism punctuation  format and got to thinking about the word sacrifice  It struck me as a bit odd first time round and have just seen it is your paraphrase of the Independent report  I assume that was your edit in Criticism  Do you think the uninformed reader will understand what is meant by sacrifice in that context ie that true jihadists sacrifice their own lives in the pursuit of jihad  I was wondering if actions the Independents word or some other word might be better or if  the passage in Criticism should be expanded to explain sacrifice  If you think the word is okay and readers will pick it up from the quote anyway thats fine although I cant imagine readers look up all the citations Do you see what I mean  Horrors I hope some admin doesnt think Im canvassing an edit Perhaps this should be on the Talk page
