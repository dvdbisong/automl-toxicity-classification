list of unsourced facts in article please add more
on such a controvertial issue every statement needs one or more sources  its ok to use a source many times  when one of these gets sourced strike it out like this dont delete  2005 Paris Suburb Riots provides a pretty good example  After I do some research of my own Im going to start taking out unsourced facts but not before 24 hours have passed unless I find a wellsourced  contradictory claim

A number of buildings associated with the Russian security forces were targeted
At least 136 people were reported killed reported by whom
The attackers were said to be a mixture of rebels from nearby Chechnya kavkaz center report doesnt mention chechnya only units from other sectors of the Caucasian Front
The rebelsterrorists attacked a wide range of targets in the city reportedly including three police stations Nalchik airport the regional headquarters of the Interior Ministry and Federal Security Service the regional headquarters of the Russian penitentiary system and a border guards office Civilians were targeted as well there were also bystanders shot in the street and hostages taken at a souvenir shop  The fighting lasted for about four hours with heavy weapons and explosives being used by both sides A few of the rebelsterrorists survived the initial fighting by taking refuge in city centre buildings and taking hostages but were killed by Russian forces the following day totally unsourced  seems to be taken from the kavkaz center report
The Russian government sent 1500 regular troops and 500 Special Forces troops to Nalchik to regain government control of the city
Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on Kavkaz CenterBasaeyev claimed that Russian security forces had been tipped off some 5 days before the attack which resulted in increased security in Nalchik
