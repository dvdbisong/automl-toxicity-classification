I have a copy of Crowleys Liber CCCLXV The Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia It is the revised 1904 translaton of Ars Goetia I am wondering where exactly alot of this information is coming from Some of it is good but some appears to be cruft Is anyone working from the original Key of Solomon text Refs would be appreciated  9 July 2005 1418 UTC
