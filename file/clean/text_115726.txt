The Commonwealth of Australia 
I have noticed several times that after I have edited the introduction from Australia to the Commonwealth of Australia it has been reverted back to just Australia I do not understand why other countries are being named with their official names but Australia is downgraded from its official name If in the title it stated something like the United States Im sure someone would edit it to put in America at the end So why is the same not applied for Australia Double standards
