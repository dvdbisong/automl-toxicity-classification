Mae West was many things but there are some inappropriate categories listed

1 Listing West as an erotic dancer needs some justification including within the article itself  Other than performing a notable shimmy at the beginning of her career she isnt known for this and the article doesnt mention any other instances  In that case she is no more an erotic dancer than Elvis Presley or Liza Minelli maybe less so than Marlee Matlin now  none of whom are listed as erotic dancers

2 Nymphomania redirects to hypersexuality which states The consensus among those who consider this a disorder is that the threshold is met when the behavior causes distress or impaired social functioning  Even the first line of the article uses the description debilitating  Wests sexual activity did not and was not  Like other sex symbols of popular culture eg Clara Bow and you can probably think of some others West was promiscuous and had a huge libido  But they chose an industry and a role where those are NOT debilitating  

No distress and no impairment means no nymphomania  Listing her there needs support especially a clinical diagnosis or it needs to be removed 24639635
