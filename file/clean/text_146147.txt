RFA number 4 

Hi Paul I saw that you recently created WikipediaRequests for adminshipPaul2387 4 You havent transcluded it yet so it isnt live Can I suggest that you reconsider applying again right now I mean this in the best possible way your hearts in the right place and you want to help out at Wikipedia but youre seriously very unlikely to succeed right now Others have recommended you waiting longer and getting more experience at your last RFAs and at your editor reviews Apart from anything else people might think that youre not very good at listening to advice which probably isnt a good trait for an administrator You seem to be good at helping out with televisionrelated articles why dont you concentrate on that for a while as well as trying to get a bit more experience behind the scenes Have a look at WikipediaMaintenance for lots of work that needs to be done and helping out at the various help desks would also be good Regards Freak
