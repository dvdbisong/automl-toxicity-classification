on your first point  fair enough what you say is true for most people here  On the second point correcting a fallacious argument  do you mean that there was someone who made an argument and it was reported in the article inaccurately  If you are correcting it to be a more accurate account of what someone argued that is good  but provide the source you are using for what that person really said  But if you mean that someone made an illogical argument our policy is that we cannot state that it is an illogical argument nor can we explain why it is an illogical argument in the article  Our views simply do not go into articles period  2235 22 Jan 2005 UTC
