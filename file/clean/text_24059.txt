Lukeon94 is a buly and is trying to imppose his point of view Apart from that there is no such policy that states a consensus cannot keep verifable information from being added and no I will not let you violate Wikipedia policies All requirements have already been met and Ive already said Wikipedia is not a media outlet We do not follow the style of media outlets here By saying that a verified material cannot be added just because some users say no This is not a Wikipedia policy Im not going to add her name because for now but will in future But first I will try contacting some admins about this matter
