edit conflict As to the second issue yes my personal view is that the content in Gianos post is a personal attack a view that arguably most in the ANI thread share The blocking policy WPBP is clear that persistently making personal attacks may trigger a block The policy does expect that blocks will be made with good reasons only based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested but that does imply that administrators must use their individual judgment  what you might call my opinion  to decide whether or not to block In particular the policy states that Warning is not a prerequisite for blocking and a fortiori discussion is not a prerequisite for blocking So yes in that sense I may be enforcing my personal opinion about what is and is not rude but that opinion must be based on sound judgment and stand up to community review
