This is the memo that I meant  by the way my German appears reallyreally really bad  the German version appears to be copied from the USA version Of course this is just one of
many memos between the participants I note that the memos that you put
forward however seem to show that the Jewish problem was being
handled in ways other than gas chambers  ie deportation or sterilization
 both rather extreme injustices but not deadly  a little reading
shows that Hitler Himmleretc could be quite squimish about 
killing people ie the wiki article Night and Fog sugggests as much
There has been attempts to question this memos provenace however this
memo is just one of several that follow the same theme  leave the Jewish problem alone at
least till the war is over If there was any gassing  or any murder of 
Jews  it was being done behind Hitlers back  and  the backs of any
loyalambitious Hitlerites  a not very plausible scenario but the one 
the memos would force on believers 

The memo I meant was

Mr Reich Minister Lammers informed me that the FÃ¼hrer had repeatedly
declared to him that he wants to hear that the Solution of the Jewish
Problem has been postponed until after the war is over That being so
the current discussions are of purely theoretical value in Mr Reich
Minister Lammers opinion He will moreover take pains to ensure that
whatever else happens no fundamental decisions are taken without his
knowledge in consequence of a surprise briefing by any third party
July 1942

Unless some scholar can find a memo dated after this that reverses the 
policy  and I believe all the memos and actions taken by various people 
ie HimmlerLuther Morgan etc  instead tend to confirm the policy  
it appears that finding a memo with a Hitler  ie official  connection
to the Holocaust is just a dream  Irvings 1000  or whatever amount  seems safe I hope this memo can make it into the article   he may have been a nasty guy but honestly he was 
probably just a bureaucrat that seems to be the treatment he 
received after the war by people on the scene 
Browsingreading the German language wikipedia  I am not really a good
German reader but correct me if you are  version of this article it
appears they also avoid the relevant memo but of course they have the
fear of prosecution over their heads In America our reluctance at least isnt legal 
Finding the Luther memo it appears this memo is of an even later date 
It is even more revealing as to what the policy toward Jews was during the war
All Jews were to be expelled from Europe after the war was over  so it 
appears Hitler was not talking gas chambersetc quite late in the war 
Memos of this sort seem to crowd all the Holocaust gassingetc into a
very small time frame  an impossibly small time frame probably why the 
memos are ignored by all right thinking people  

PS I just found out that the Luther memo has a long history It has been ignored 
since at least the 1970s I thought this was a relatively recent discovery
by scholars etc  it appears to just be an old unanswerable embarrasment 
to the Holocaust story Thanks for pushing me to search harder One of the troubles
with trying to hide or falsify history appears to be that it takes very little work
by very unknowledgeable people  ie me   to discover the truth I found most of the
information that seems more plausible than the official story by just hitting ENTER
on more than the the first page of search engine results
