Proposed edits
Never edited an article before so thought id put these ideas and bits of information here first for people to comment on before messing about with stuff and making a mess of things

Firstly the FGD for Units 3 and 4 is now complete and operational

Also there are now plans for a multi fuel CHP plant on the site httpwwwssecomFerrybridgeTheMultiFuelProject

And a carbon capture pilot scheme is currently under construction which will capture 1 of the flue gas from Unit 4 equivalant to 5MW httpwwwssecomFerrybridgeTheCCSProject

The figure of 218 million litres of CW an hour doesnt really mean anything to me its quite a difficult thing to imagine maybe stating something along the lines that this equates to the 4 CW pumps delivering roughly 60 tonnes of CW every second or enough to fill an olympic sized swimming pool in under a minute might help people visualise just how much 218 million litres an hour is

There is a note stating Not to be confused with Eggborough Power Station or Drax Power Station at the beginning of the article which is fair enough as they all sit in a line within about 15 miles of each other and are easily confused but theres no similar note on either the Eggborough or Drax articles Seems sensible that this warning should be included on all 3 articles or none at all rather than just one
