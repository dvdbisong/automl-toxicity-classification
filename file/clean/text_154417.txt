Hi there OK I see what youve done here  almost a pseudolink that refers you to a list of references at pagebottom as opposed to inserting the titles authors etc in brackets in the actual sentence Could you forward me the code to use in order to have for example this reference linked to the bottom of the page

Como Llego La Noche Matos Huber Tusquets2004

Thanks much  this seem to read much more easily when referencing in this manner
