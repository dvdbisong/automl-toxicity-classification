My suggestion a proper Themes section with reliable sources discussing such things Becoming more human is part of the plot but the plot section itself shouldnt be so detailed Details are meant to provide context for real world information and are usually best used when they are right next to that information which usually happens to be in the Production type sections or a Themes section and not in the Plotthough you can write a plot with actual real world commentary thats what I did here Id much rather see a trimmed concise plot kind of like this with scene descriptions attached to real world context   Contact me
