Moving details below
I think the details regarding the official reason provided by Israel from banning him from Israel should be moved to the section below per WPUNDUE It is sufficiently notable to be mentioned in the introduction in a slightly shorter form only because it inhibits his humanitarian work in Palestine for which he is known but in itself being banned from entering Israel by the far right government there is not taken seriously anywhere else in the world as they routinely ban academics or Nobel laureates who criticize them as well I have no problem with including the fact that Israel says the reason was contact with Hamas leaders below which is hardly considered a very strong or sensational accusation as they are the governing party there and considering the fact that Norwegian conservative politicians also have meetings with Hamas and having contact with Hamas is hardly considered any more controversial than meeting their Israeli counterparts in the Israeli government
