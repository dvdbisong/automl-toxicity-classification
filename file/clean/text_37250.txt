Why are their now references to most text and all pictures in the galling article 

We obviously dont have consensus because I and Diego Moya and many other Wikipedia participant acknowledge the fact that incorporated scientific pictures clearly must be of your own scientific work and also include a link to the pictures peer viewed and published scientific source Or else it will be almost impossible to incorporate any type of pictures to the Wikipedia articles

UserGameOn and his associates for some strange reason wants information and knowledge about the source of the pictures and text found in the galling article to be kept hidden and not easy accessible against the paragraphs in the Wikipedia manual against censure ship 

Unfortunately I dont have the knowledge to make you and your associated blocked from Wikipedia due to acts of censure ship

Question to GameOn why du you think your opinion is more valuable than many others
