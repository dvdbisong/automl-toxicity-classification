Notice to new visitors who want to make changes

Hi  there is a system here that allows oldtime members to instantly WIPE OUT any changes you add in Took me two weeks to figure this out Thus to work in the system add your comments to the DISCUSSION  page which thousands of readers now are looking at thanks to GOOGLE Your points
will be read and some may last a whileSome may be verified found in a bookANYBOOK and then 
added to the main page with a footnote reference It is best if you take teh tiome and dig out 
a page saying what you want in a known book such as The Bigfoot Files and not in old fart books like Pyle These Wicki people are veryvery uptight and jealous and resent newcomers
So try my idea Quote things Newspapers tv shows websites journals books and newsletters
SOME info may make it  That is the game so we must play it

Ask for Zoe by name or Bishonen by name or Bunchofgrapes by name or DanielCD by name to assist They will see it and may help 

Ve must be cool and no vandalism wiping out sections pleeze
