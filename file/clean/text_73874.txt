Ray Carver dart player 

My edit to this article is in no way shape or form vandalism Your favorite thing to do here is to throw away WP links however you never seem to understand what they actually are Quoting from the policy itself

Any goodfaith effort to improve the encyclopedia even if misguided or illconsidered is not vandalism Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism For example adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism

Not only is a personal opinion clearly stated as NOT vandalism but my edit doesnt even fall under the category of opinion I stated several FACTS which anyone who knows Ray Carver would confirm I am a member of the darting community myself and have played Ray Carver on several occasions in addition to seeing him play and others and listening to others views on him Have YOU done any of this Do you even know who Ray Carver is

I am tired of your constant tactic of arrogantly deciding what YOU think should or shouldnt be on Wikipedia quoting policies that you clearly dont understand and then counting on the quantity of your edits and contributions here to see your way through to victory

If you continue your crusade against me and most especially in this particular article I will make you show cause on your reverts to the powers that be here
