I wasnt alleging that youd requested that I be blocked  I was warning you because if you delete my comments again Im going to request that you be blocked  If you want you can whine about that threat to an administrator but Im pretty sure its not grounds for blocking    

Please take the time to look at the policies regarding civil behavior You comments on the BSGDaylight part 2 talk page have been less than civil in their content Per the WPCivil policy comments such as these can and will be deleted without such actions being considered censorship or blanking The people you have been engaging in have tried repeatedly to maintain a professional tone in the conversations while you have not We are not saying that your points are wrong but how you are going about this is all we are asking is for you to wait until the time that such assertions you are making are confirmed by a reliable third party source that verifies what you believe to be true 

Your comments on my page also confirm your inappropriate behavior and do nothing but harm yourself so please assume good faith when dealing with others and scale back on the tone and content of your posts  blah blah 

Wikipedias policy on civility is meant to remove threats profanity and personal attacks  None of that applies to my comments  But there are some parts of Wikipedias policy on civility that apply to you  It says among other things to treat constructive criticism as an attack is itself disruptive and may result in warnings or even blocks It is not normally appropriate to edit or remove another editors comment  Looks like thats another policy that youre breaking  What is that now four  IAR Use Common Sense Discuss your concerns rather than engage in edit wars and now the policy on Civility  Are you going for a record  I have repeatedly asked you to point out which part of my argument you disagree with  You have failed to do so  Youre the problem here not me
