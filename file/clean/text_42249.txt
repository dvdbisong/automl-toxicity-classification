You are comparing uncomparable You mention Spain and United Kingdom but LOOK AT THE LANGUAGES In Spain it is Catalan Basque and so on In UK it is Irish Scotish Welsh and so on That languages are PART OF SPAIN AND UK It is the same like if you would put as an official language in Czech Republic ie Moravian language and thats OK Realize that in almost every country in the world there are some legal exceptions when it is possible to use other than the MAIN language but is absurd to put it in the main infobox on Wiki to confuse people they come to Czech article on Wiki and they see that official language of CR is Russian
 Regarding the Wikipedia definition of official langue  that article is editable as anything on Wiki  so please dont link to Wiki as a source
