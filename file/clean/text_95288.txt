It is true that you refactored this comment about ten minutes before I posted at WPAE But my comment still stands conidering that it took a week of multiple complaints by editors and admins and a posting to WPANI and WPAE before you actually issued a sincere apology for your mockery of my template And Im also talking about your lack of an apology or recognition of your bad behvaiour this time around choosing instead to focus on my alleged soapboxing please provide even one diff that supports that statement and the behaviour of other editors instead of your own talk
