preJanuary 2012 content 

The edit of 1 Feb 2012 0736 is titled restored some remove content However this is effectively a revert of edits which were intended to lessen the advertising tone and jargon previously in this article I believe most of the factual content was retained albeit heavily reworded for the above aims Also the article was restructured so that people who are not experts in Bose product categorisation can follow it easier and this has been reverted Please identify specific phrases that do not have an equivalent in the new text then we can incorporate them in a more neutral manner
