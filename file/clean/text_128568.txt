Illustrations 

Im wondering whether we really want to have thorough graphic examples of all these typefaces here The page is called List of Typefaces not Examples of Typefaces and this could get way out of hand in a hurry For anyone without a broadband connection it has already a nightmare to load the page Let me be clear I appreciate Diegos painstaking work in creating the samples and uploading them but Im just not sure this page is the best venue for such a project What about putting these graphics on the page for each individual typeface Im certainly willing to help create new pages
