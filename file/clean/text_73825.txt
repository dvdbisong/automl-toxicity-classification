Appearance changes
i notice from time to time someone either changes the height and weight under the appearance section or adds incorrect heights and weights to the text under pictures the maximum weight of 120 pounds and maximum heights of 29 and 27 for males and females are not given by any authority the martinez breed standard stated 6065cm and current fciukc and akc state 6268cm the original standard stated weight should be 4045kg or 882992 pounds with the current authorities stating they should be proportionate as far as weight goes a 29 120lb male may be proportionate but over 68cm 2677 would be an automatic disqualifier
