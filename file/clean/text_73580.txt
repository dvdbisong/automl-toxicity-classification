Re Disputation edit disputing outlandish Zheng HeChinese claim to introduce Islam into SE Asia
There are major factual errors in many of the sophistic augments attributing events to Zheng He With regard to the introduction of Islam to Indonesia and essentially the region including Malaysia and Philippines I have added important data from peerreviewed texts which are usually on prescribed reading for university course curriculum which reflect the academic discourse and not the fantasy hagiography of Menzies and the other halfwitted hacks The chiense academic discourse in the main reflects identically that of Western discourse and it is damaging and insulting to serious Chinese academics 
Lets all please try and make Wikipedia something less than a total joke or forum for sophistic cultural aggrandisement and petty bourgeoisie historical revisionism Frankly a lot of this article is dreadful it attempts to pass off fallacy and fantasy as consensusacademic discourse fact
