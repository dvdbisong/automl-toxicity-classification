Thank you for the offer but Im not really in a good position to tell you what to restore since Im not quite certain what the restoration process involves

Would it be worth cleaning up FileSiege of FlorenceJPG  Or is the base image of too poor quality to bother  Ive not been able to find a largerresolution image of the fresco unfortunately

If that ones not worth touching then the one you suggested would be just fine I think Â talk
