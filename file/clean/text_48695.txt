Highest escalators NOT longest 

As I understand it the Angel escalators have a greater vertical rise than the Tyne Tunnel escalators  274m vs 260m  but they are actually shorter in length 60m vs 61m presumably due to being set at a steeper angle

The Tyne Tunnel escalators were the longest escalators in Western Europe when they were installed in 1951 and remain so today 21715520163
