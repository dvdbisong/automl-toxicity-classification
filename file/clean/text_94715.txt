Misessus I will leave you to the mercy of Wikipedia    

Daniel I have only one view It agrees with yours and part of Misessus Kind of neutral hey 

Daniel although I feel your are an honest broker you wear the blinkers of what is generally accepted and you are quite paranoid and a bit naive You should learn with time to place more trust in the good faith of mankind and not to believe everything you read on Wikipedia as always the absolute factual truth Remember new discoveries are being made all the time peer reviewed and then revealed to the general public  even here on Wikipedia although you do not realize it You have read it many times in the article but you cannot see the difference it makes to everything in the economy

Daniel not everyone is only interested in yanking your chain I am not sure I even know exactly what it means and all that jazz some of us are actually interested in real economics and its development and will seek to take the best from every school of thought including the Austrians and build the future thereon On the way we will encounter people like you too That is generally accepted
