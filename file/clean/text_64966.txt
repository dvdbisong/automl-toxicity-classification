I guessed p you know there is no single offical document found in Ottoman archives that shows an order of exterminatio or killings there is no vansee meeting like that germans did the jews were not fighting in an enemy army the jews were not after authonomy and so on I guess you are mistaking an ethnic clensing in the worst case i dont fully accept that definition either with a genocide can I send you some articles showing the position of Turkish jews maybe they are more reliable for you
