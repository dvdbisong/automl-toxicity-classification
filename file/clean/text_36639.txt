Destroy the opposition
Well great this oddly framed RfC has resulted in the addition of a few words and the utter destruction of the good faith of several longterm editors  Of course Flyer22 has already predicted this she has a special link to the future and as she has told me she is far better placed to predict the future than me  Problem is shes shat on her own patch  Many of us remember that Flyer22 was a great generous kind contributor  Right now all we will take away is a scathing and unpleasant experience  A smug I know better predeliction and a victim complex is seriously a problem  I know for a fact that many editors who used to hold her in esteem are now looking long and hard at her contributions to check that this individual isnt so buoyed up that she starts to believe her own press  Really sad  But for someone who is so selfobsessed and so selfabsorbed no shocks
