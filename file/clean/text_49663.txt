Ok Im not gonna lie this does have some issues concidering this and is gonna need some cleanup but hey you still did a great job with it I know I wouldnt do as good in a hundred years so dont worry the effort wasnt wasted Now on to the glossary Well The Hearts Special Items and Planets sections content could be moved to that article the Heart of Kandrakar getting a mention also with a link to its main article some frequently visited locations like the Infinite City the Fortress of Infinity places the Guardians frequently visit Mount Thanos also This is gonna be tough trying to make something encyclopedic and not a crufty list which could get deleted in two days Thats why I wanted to see how the guys at the WITCH page felt about this maybe we bring this up at the talk page  TC
