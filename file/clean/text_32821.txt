Requested move 20 November 2015 

Infant vision    I propose we move this article to a more comprehensive development of   style article that includes development in infants and adults as it is expanded I think this article is too large to be merged into Visual system but that its unnecessary to have a split all the way to Infant vision at this stage A Development of article can act as a central focus for this information as the article is developed
