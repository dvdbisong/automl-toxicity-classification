Disambiguation Links 

Hi Evilbu

What I changed on the Quadric projective geometry page was simply an incorrectly directed link to a disambiguation page  The link to field had been linking to field which is the disambiguation page for the word field but I changed it to link to the correct page field mathematics  

What you went to when you clicked on the you can help link should have taken you to WikipediaDisambiguation pages with links which is a wiki fixup project  The project works to fix all wikilinks that link to disambiguation pages and instead have the links link the specific article that they refer to
Let me know if you have any other questions and I hope you continue contributing to Wikipedia
