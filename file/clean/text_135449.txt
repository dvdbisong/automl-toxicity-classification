The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect it was a work of art flawless sublime A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature However I was again frustrated by failure I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another an intuitive program initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche If I am the father of the matrix she would undoubtedly be its mother
