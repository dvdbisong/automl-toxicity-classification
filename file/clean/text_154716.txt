Lofat 

Hi Saposcat

 adviced to ask you There is an urban legend in Hungary about the etymology of a word LÃ³fasz Thats pretty rude it means horses dick The legend  which may be true  says that it comes from an old Turkish word Lofat which was a torturing device back in the 15th16th century Its a long stake or pole used for impalement See picture here As the picture shows there was such a device but I have no sources if it was called lofat Could you please tell me if that or a very similar turkish word existed in the middle ages

Thank you Best regards
