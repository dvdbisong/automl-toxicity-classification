Im not opposing such a formulation Instead Im trying to prevent potential editwars by inclusion of both views Bosnian and Serbian writer However it seems that there is a third view Yugoslavian writer and so an option is to mention all of them Yugoslavian Bosnian and Serbian writer Although this may read cumbersome maybe its worth trying All the best s talk
