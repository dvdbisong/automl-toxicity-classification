Well actually that helps out my clearly won and clearly proven but dismissed in favor of bias argument since the other parts of CT are not counted as Boston so it is not hub for ANY part of CT  Also somone erased this but I also pointed out that the link includes Torrington CT which is up by Mass So now that this issue has been PROVEN 50x over compared to NO PROOF from these editors to show that you people are neutral now is the time to change that article for truth sake and not because you wish that people see thingslies the way that you want them to see it  If you read the NY Times would you want to read lies  Would you want them to just make up stories or have articles read with bias towards an authors opinion  This is what clearly goes on on Wikipedia  Too bad most people think that this is a real and valid source of true information
