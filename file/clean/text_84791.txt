Roc Nation Template
Hi there 

Im sure you a nice person but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the TemplateRoc Nation just under reason of Reverting edits by blockevading sockpuppeteer when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011 and all the edits I have made to the TemplateRoc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011 So I just dont understand what you mean by blockevading sockpuppeteer and when Tinchy Stryders name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryders name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being coowner of Roc Nation UKbased subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company the same goes to Stargate production team who are the coowners of the Roc Nation USbased StarRoc record label and publishing company I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as Im pretty sure it is not I would like to think this is not a biased issue as Im sure your a nice person  Thank you
