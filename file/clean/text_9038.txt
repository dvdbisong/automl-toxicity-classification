Error becoming acceptable 

The most common error that I see regarding the use or misuse of the plural noun is the use of the word emails Email meaning electronic mail is both singular and plural Someone may receive one piece of mail email or many pieces of mail email Since it would be incorrect to say I received lots of mails it is just as incorrect to say I received lots of emails 

The problem I see with this is that the use of emails has spawned a growing acceptance of the misuse of plural nouns in general It is amazing to see in both the written and spoken word how educated people increasingly misuse the plural noun  

For example take some time on any given day and listen to the dribble that comes out of the mouths of news reporters It is atrocious what you will hear when you are paying attention

I wonder where it will end
