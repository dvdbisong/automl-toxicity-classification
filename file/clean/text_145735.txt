Sorry about being so backward in my thanks but I only just discovered your  getwell wishes which made me laugh  or at least made me try to laugh   I seem to have misplaced my lungs although Im sure theyll turn up somewhere Ive resorted to buccal breathing in respectful and appreciative solidarity with our amphibian friends 

One thing occurred to me in my languid repose we should discuss the age dependence of the immune system  You know how young toddlers seem to have supercharged immune systems important for surviving daycare whereas older people get sick more readily  One cute factoid I gleaned from a dentist was that older people get a lot more cavities because they have dry mouths producing less saliva means fewer protective peptides and they suck on sweet lozenges to wet their whistles providing a nice diet of pure sucrose for their unwelcome guests  Anyway speaking more generally I think that lay readers would be really interested in the whole agedependence thing as it touches all their lives  Maybe someone there can look into it  Ill try to tackle the hormonal thing

Slinking back to bed 

PS For someone with very poor memory youre remarkably good at remembering our MCB votes  Note to self recalibrate scale for Tims selfassessments  Thanks muchly for your own vote of confidence and Ill be happy to relieve you of the more mundane tasks once I get well again  Hopefully  will recover before I do
