Im sorry this just wasnt a very significant moment in my life that I felt necessary to build a forensic trail of evidence I very much enjoy and appreciate Wikipedia but its nothing more than something I occasionally popin to edit or create an article occasionally After reviewing your link it appears my only contribution to this issue was a poorly thoughtout side remark to an editor in an unrelated ANI a few months back I never pursued the matter beyond that nor did I file a complaint regarding the emails nor did I even remember it occurred until I logged back on after a few months away to edit an article Id previously written and found your many messages to me Please understand 
 The song and dance is not a creature of my conjuring I am only following up on this short exchange that I barely recall as you escalated the question and have pursued it over a period of several months However as I said I am committed to doing my absolute best to accommodate your interest in this matter in point of clarification to your above comment I have to admit I am unaware of other thirdparty editors who expressed similar passion to you and seem to recall the others involved IIRC UserNE Ent UserDennis Brown UserTParis were differently expressive but if I am wrong then kindly accept that I should have said I am also trying to accommodate their interest as well As far as I know it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a song and dance is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry please understand  the preceding is not intended to be trite I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me so as to assuage any concerns of a song and dance 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories forthwith I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation I know youve said youre incredulous to that notion but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended  as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing  and not as a slight in any way If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you 
If there is anything else I can help you with please do not hesitate to let me know however in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner I would like to suggest we terminate this backandforth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be Best
