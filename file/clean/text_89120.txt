partially recognised Republic of Abkhazia 

Is this a precisely defined term Because the only countries that recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia apart from Russia which is obviously going to recognise its own attempt to establish new satellite provinces are Venezuela Nicaragua and Nauru two of which are nonentities geopolitically and all of which are thousands of miles away and have no business in that part of the world whatsoever Except inasmuch as they gain political advantage by sucking up to the Kremlin

So I would say barely recognised or disputed Partial to me makes me think at least 20  30 of the worlds states have recognised the place not 2 But perhaps partially recognised is a legal term that covers all countries recognised by more than one other state or something In which case perhaps some more knowledgable editor can clarify 86181239136
