Directors of Naval Intelligence response  Public campaigns 

The Public campaigns section contains quotes from activists politicians professors and all kinds of people with no first hand knowledge of the case  they simple have a proPollard agenda to push These comments have been piling up and up and up 

Meanwhile the most germane informed and valuable quote in this section keeps getting trimmed back and suppressed  the response from former Directors of Naval Intelligence This is obvious POV pushing by people with a proPollard slant

Just Compare the magnitude of propollard quotes from people who have nothing to do with the actual case and the low quality of information contained in those quotes to the relatively concise response from the former Directors of Naval Intelligence who are actually in the know and have something valuable to say 

I will be restoring the Directors of Naval Intelligence response and trimming back the propollard propaganda per WPUNDUE
