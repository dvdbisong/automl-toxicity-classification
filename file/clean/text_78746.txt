Proposal 

I propose a solution to the issue posed by the guideline regarding disambiguation pages and the resulting AfD keep the article and simply remove disambiguation from the article title Thus this would become the article Apartheid with a short definition and citation to the Afrikaans origin and then links to the various usages with History of South Africa in the apartheid era being the first and most prominent link with the others following retaining the language about usage being an analogy to South African apartheid 

This solves the disambiguation guideline issue I dont believe there is a consensus to delete this article and argued in favor of keeping it but I acknowledge the argument that it is less of a literalclassic disambiguation page and more of a here are some uses of the term which have Wikipedia articles page I believe there are a number of precedents for that type of page where a term is discussed in different contexts some or all of which have individual articles
