User Kannambadi please do not try to frighten and justify blocks on me  Did the person who blocked me on two occasions first of all I do know it was you and your other friends who cannot tolerate a counter opinion who prompted the irresponsible blocking on the previous occasions you are again giving a seemingly sage advice for first discussing before carrying out edits do you remember what you told the user I forget his name but he was from Maharashtra  You wrote I borrow from Kamath you go and get it from a good library I have a good library near my home and town where the book is available Thus you left it all on the person countering YOUR opinion to prove otherwise Why not do the same thing this time around  

I have indeed borrowed from two books called Ancient India one by KANSastri and RCRoychowdhuri These are two books of the same name by the above named two authors with Roychowdhuri borrowing extensively from Sastri  I also think that the book by KANSastri is dated 1959 while the one of Roychowdhury is either 1951 or 1961 probably it is 1961 edition  Roychowdhuris book is quite different from the edition of the same book available on the internet at booksgooglecom

Please also try preaching the same to the irresponsible user who blocked me in that he should also have practiced what you are preaching me that is first indulge in a discussion before taking action to block contributors like me Did he do that He simply barged into my page like a bull in the china shop and blindly commented that I have made personal commentary on the Chola page and hence he was blocking me  This after I had painstakingly borrowed from noted epigraphist Huntzshs summary of the rule of the Chola empire where he had sought to dispel the notions that they were devout Saivites by saying that during the rule of the second Chola king ie Aditya I itself two temples ie the Siva Temple of Chidambaram and the one at Srirangam being a Vishnu temple and regarded the most important Siva and Vishnu temples were both declared as Kuladhanam family heritage sites for the Chola kings ordaining in a way that the kings of this dynasty one after another will look personally after the upkeep of traditions at both the temples and their well being Indeed I made the mistake of not quoting Prof Huntzsh again courtesy the site you love to deride calling it a POV website despite using it to support points on Chalukyas and Hoysalas but on my very next visit on the same day I found that the department of dirty tricks had prompted Blinguen to block me for the second time Does Blinguen have any knowledge at all of Indian history most of all of the history of the Cholas Hoysalas or Pandiyans and most of all of your beloved Chalukya Cholas  Certainly I would have loved to engage him on a one to one debate on Indian history especially that of South India  I also wrote to Taprobanus wanting to prosecute Blinguen and requested for his address  

It is a shame that cowards contacted him it seems on the email or on phone to complain about me but no one ever wrote about it in the open no one contacted me and most of all no one ever wanted to discuss the matter Rather people who scarcely contributed to the Chola page like user Earth etc started advocating this and that  Mind you user Earth himself was adviced by another admin when he complained about me that the contributions made by me were in good faith only but it seems ultimately the dirty gang on wikipedia bent upon converting it into some sort of monkeypedia finally had their say

What you basically always do is you want to write and not just that you want whatever you write to be retained at all costs but in the process you forget counter opinions by other historians as well  KANSastri has written in his book as opposed to what you wrote quoting Kamath that Satyasraya defeated crown prince Rajendra that Rajendra Chola defeated Satyasraya he wrote something like next was the turn of Satyasraya who fled the battlefield near the fields of Hottur and hid in the jungles of Kogali and Kadambalige  I would say exactly for you find among the limited number of inscriptions available of Satyasraya courtesy the site you always try to trash inscriptionswhatsindiacom which are indeed found at Kogali and Kadambalige and in fact in a couple of these inscriptions Satyasraya even is called as ruling from Kadambalige Kindly access this information in the same manner as I have done and exactly in the same manner as you expect others to do ie access appropriate information from appropriate sources   Even in this I do not want to claim whatever I say is correct indeed if Satyasraya is attributed by Kamath with victory over Rajendra then kindly also quote other sources where Rajendra claims victory over the Chalukyas including the most important Wo
