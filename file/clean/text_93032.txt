As for the google search I think youre giving too much weight to YouTube encomiums  She may have left a posthumous cache of ghazals she wrote and there may be recordings in her own voice of a few  But shes certainly not a wellknown or wellregarded ghazal singer  As a general rule I feel that if this factoid isnt even in her Wikipedia article it shouldnt be included in other articles as if it were an established fact
