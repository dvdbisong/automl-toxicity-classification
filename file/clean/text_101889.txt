Thanks for clearing up that indefed contributor Lindashiers is pursuing her text copyright infringement against Google not WMF Its her sexual harassment complaint against Sitush which is pending with WMF Googles reply to the 23Aug2014 DMC complaint viewable online declined those takedowns because the IAC had approached Google directly That evidentally caused Lindashiers and the agent from Name Defend India to land up at WP copyright on 3 Sept2014 and fire their 2nd DMCA barrel after Voceditenore rejected it Anyway this is all very interesting but is the Sarbajit Roy article to come here or go somewhere else
