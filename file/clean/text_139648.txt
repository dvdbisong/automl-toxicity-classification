Disruption by Ed Poor at his conflict of interest 

You had previously given  this warning Ed Im not going to play your games Youve been warned watch your step on Moon and Unification related articles I will not hesitate to block if you continue to disrupt Puppy has spoken puppy is done 

Ed Poor has continued to engage in disruption at articles directly in his conflict of interest namely attempting to remove info linking related organizations and front groups to the Unification Church and Sun Myung Moon removing sourced information and making disruptive page moves against consensus Please see  and  for two recent examples Enough warnings have been given at this point Thoughts
