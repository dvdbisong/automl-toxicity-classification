According to your logic reverting vandalism would be disruptive too and should lead to blocking  I think the problem here is that like many admins you barely contribute to Wikipedia and care little about its content  You are mainly a janitor and policeman and tend to develop a janitors and a policemans attitude  It is an issue of systemic bias  Ordinary users tend to have an editors attitude ie their priority is making articles as good as possible and not accept other peoples bad edits

Your mention of discussion on talk pages is fantasy  Oh I do of course discuss matters on talk pages at great length look at this for example but I am under no illusions that people like you or Eiorgiomugini will be swayed by any amount of logical argument  At the end of the day the only way that editors can make sure that articles have good content and not bad content is by inserting good content and removing bad content  This is my observation after long examination of Wikipedia
