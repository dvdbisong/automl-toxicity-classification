Unfair Accusation of Spamming 

Moved from my talk page
Hello

I feel that my addition of external links to the Wikipedia pages Genesis creation narrative Ibbur and Gilgul have been unfairly flagged for inappropriate activity The external links added are primary source texts directly related to the Wikipedia page subject  They are not commercial or ideological Please advise

Thank you

I removed them because they linked to a blog and blogs are not considered reliable sources for Wikipedia if you feel they are a special case you could discuss on the article talk pages This link may be helpful links normally to be avoided All good wishes   

Ok I understand and thanks for responding I still feel my external links provide important primary source texts that are not available online Yes they are presented on a blog but there is no writing of my own presented Please reconsider
