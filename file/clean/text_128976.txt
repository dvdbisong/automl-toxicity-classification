On a side note this again is yet another antique quinolone noroxin aka norfloxacin first approved by the FDA in 1986 and like ciprofloxacin there is no data on the FDA site for this drug between 1986 and 1994  And the NDA is not available  So there is going to be very little to work with when it comes to updating the article  I would be shocked if this was still in use let alone considered to be a commonly prescribed quinolone here in the States
