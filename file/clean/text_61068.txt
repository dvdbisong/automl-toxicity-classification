I think the guidelines suggest that narratives on a list serve a limited function  allowing readers to understand the list  The more narrative you add the more this becomes an ARTICLE about SPLC designated hate groups  I have no problems with that but there should be a conscious decision supported by consensus to do that  If my memory serves me correctly there was such an article it was deleted and this list was offered as a replacement
