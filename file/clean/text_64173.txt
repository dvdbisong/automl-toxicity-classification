Notability 

If you used a different word maybe you would make yourself more clear Notability as per the wikipedia policy is completely and utterly about articles and in no way applies once an article is deemed notable It has nothing to do with the contents of an article or whether this or that should be added or removed It says so right on the page These notability guidelines only outline how suitable a topic is for its own article They do not directly limit the content of articles
