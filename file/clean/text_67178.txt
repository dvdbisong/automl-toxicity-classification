Fair enough From what I understand Goble must have originally published this for KP and then put it in his blog as wellas is the case with many journalists these days and social media throw it on the blog twitter facebook etc just to get it out there right Several other news outlets cite the Goble article as being from KP not his blog What was the reason for delying the EurasiaReview source  line about onging debate The ER article quoted political figures on their stance on the issue if its just some bloggers in a flash mob why would politicianssenatorsetc even care enough to comment on it
