Never heard of it at all I had heard of the Fife cup just not exactly what it was I hit a snag with updating the stats on Raith rovers for the Fife cup it appears the template only takes a maximum of four cups So i managed to update the dunfermline stats ok as they only participate in three competitions The result is included just not the stats for it
