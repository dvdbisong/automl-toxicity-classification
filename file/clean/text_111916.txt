As far as dubious sources this page has most of its sources coming from various Che biographies written by friends and appologists for themthis gives a pov  If you leave out my section then almost everything else from the page should be deleted as well  Furthermore if my sources are dubious at best what kind of dubious pov is giong to be provided when quoting the thoughts and words of Che directly  Do you really think Che would criticize himself  If supporting Che and being Che are the only qualifications for being a proper source for this article And that seems to be what is being said here then we have violated the Wiki NPOV rulesquite blatantly
