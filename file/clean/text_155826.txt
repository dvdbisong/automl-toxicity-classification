Jimbo 

I hope youll take this as its meantthat is without too much rancorbut I think its time for you to put up or shut up I think the problem that at least some people are having with your issues with Eric is that while youre talking about it youre not actually doing anything about it If you think Eric should be banned dont just snark about it on your talk page actually start a ban discussion on AN or Arbcom case request or whatever you think should be done Because right now at least from where Im sitting all it looks like is that you just want to take potshots at him from the sidelines and until this ANI thread in a place where you forbade him from responding which is hardly an open discussion and you dont actually care about fixing this failure of governance If you really think this is a problem that needs solving then its time to get on your proverbial horse and ride marshal your various arguments and diffs of evidence and start the discussion in the appropriate place this talk page aint it just like any other editor Stop talking and start doing oh and if you think that well I cant start it because Im Jimbo and people will think that Jimbo starting a discussion means it wont be fair to Ericwell snarking from the sidelines against him isnt much better so why are you doing that
