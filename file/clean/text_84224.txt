Thanx

I am NOT intersted to sign as I do DISAGREE  with many who are granted the privilege of monitoring the Wikipedia  as moderators
  
We  first need to clean the house  and get those who should NOT be moderators as they luck the qualifications

This  applies to some moderators from EASTERN EUROPE  with unintentional nationalistic or  procommunist orientation some military personell as moderators is vandalizing articles with wrong methods of confrontation  and some members of US  Congress who are correcting their CV RESUMES  specially  prior to eRections

This applies also to people  specialy those with PhDs  who think they know it all and in real life they only read some required by programs books prepared by special intersts and really know nothing
  
To many  young inexperienced while colorful PHEASANTS are  allowed to be moderators

The YOUTH  and  inexperienced irrational behavior is NOT a substitude for over half of the century education and experience
