Coolceaser edits against UC Hastings 

Amerique

Sorry to bug you but I think you resolved the dispute with Coolceasar on the UC Hastings page very nicely  I now note Coolceasar has been making biased who knows why assertions against Hastings on the general UC page editing the page so the Hastings is not considered a UC but only an affiliated institution  There is a long exchange back and forth between Cool Ceasar ands another Hastings grad not me I came in at the end but I think the situation needs thirdparty input somebody who didnt go to Hastings and can include their opinion on the evidence  

Thanks
