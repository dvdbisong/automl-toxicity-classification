I went back and checked most of your last three days of reverts using that tool and I found quite a few other cases when it had misbehaved all exept one had by now been fixed by other editors It seems to be broken when the diff between the vandalised page and the page you revert to is more than around 45k ie blankings although in one case your tool only restored 15k Its a rather nasty bug since reverts by well established users like you isnt likely to be checked by RCpatrollers So I hope its fixed now or if not that you manually check your reverts when you use the tool especially when you revert blankings of big articles
