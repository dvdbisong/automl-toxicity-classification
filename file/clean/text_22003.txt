yes what a great game From what I kept up with from live commentary from Eurosport I could tell it was a great game Unfortunately my university studies will get in the way of all the Champions League games at least for the group stage as over here in Toronto they start at 245pm where my classes are scheduled You have it lucky in Itsly where you can watch it after work Very upset about it but what are you gonna do I could watch a re run of the game but I cant quite ever get into it because I already know what happens its not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone I like shouting at the TV screen You probably know the feeling hahaha Highlights are he best bet but I know it doesnt show the full story of the game So I cant banter much but what a game it would have been Im sure I talked to my brother about it though who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasnt for Buffon it would be a whole different story I love to see Buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top 3 goalkeeper at least This just goes to show that you cant doubt a teams Champions League performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league As a true fan you are always rough on your team but always stay by them through thick and thin As youve said this should be a great confidence boost for Juve and can hopefully channel it towards Serie A and further CL games as there is still a long way to go Hopefully Juve can win the title for a 5th straight and prove to all the people that its Roma or Inters time for the Scudetto in their place haha Regards
