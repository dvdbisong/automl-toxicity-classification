Im sorry that my edit made you upset but the revert was justified under Wikipedias policies on vandalism being that you seemed to be redacting a users name for no particular reason thus I took the typical response to vandalism The issue was you didnt use an edit summery therefor I had no context for why you were undoing it See Kudzu1s response where he provided an edit summery to give context to the issue I apologize for the misunderstanding but next time please use an edit summery so this can all be avoided Thanks
