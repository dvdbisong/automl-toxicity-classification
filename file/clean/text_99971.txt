To others
 thank you for the lesson about how people can say and act differently The gap between your alleged mentoring and the insulting comment like mother is striking enough Since you mentioned about Tanthalas if you prefer his way well Id be very careful On contrary to your analysis I believe in Wikipedias virtue and trust many good users and admins However so we can happily agree that adminship is based on the community trust I wish you get over your RfA soon 

However compared with Tenmei and Bugs nasty bashing I got realized  is a gentleman even though he said nothing good about me However his comment is understandable because I did not assume good faith on him in the last occasion I may apologize to him for that matter 

George sorry for the trouble I think this brief reply to them is necessary for courtesy I will follow your advice and warning onwards Caspian blue
