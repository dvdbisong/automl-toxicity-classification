Thanks It is my gradual work but sourcing was going to be the last thing I did after I got around to redoing the modern history but I havent had much time recently not that IÃ¨m the only one who could do it cough so sourcing has suffered as well Its the least fun part lol going back and citing census figures or the historie of travaile in Virginia or the other documents but I have been archiving the stuff for when I do get a chance maybe in another week or so 0054 14
