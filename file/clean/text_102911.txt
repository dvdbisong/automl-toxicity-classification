I think the list should either be kept out of the article altogether or it should be explicitly limited to a small number say half a dozen of particularly notable clustering systems for which some strong argument can be made for their inclusion beyond its a clustering system or even its a free clustering system By a strong argument I mean statements such as its the most widely used free clustering system for Linux or the like Anything less restrictive is just an invitation for an unencyclopedic link farm
