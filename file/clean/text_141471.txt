The range map was created in Photoshop though it could just as easily or more easily have been created in MS Paint  I searched WikiCommons for a map of Madagascar that I liked showing state borders and rivers and fortunately what I found as in the public domain  I just zoomed in on the map and started coloring carefully with a paintbrush tool  The s were added with a text tool  I saved the work when finished and uploaded as a derived image on WikiCommons

You dont have to worry about the other lemur pages  Ill gladly do those  If one is a priority and you cant wait for me to get around to it just tell me of its importance and Ill make time  In fact I also owe you a few favors so if you still have problems creating these maps Id be willing to make a couple for you as long as you can point me to a source so I know what to draw  Best wishes
