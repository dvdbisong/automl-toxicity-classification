Bunnies 

I may be 63 but the small child version of me is still very much alive I love bunnies When I was a toddler I would grab every animal I set eyes on from bees to horses in order to try to pet it or hug it and kiss it Of course I got bitten and stung quite a lot by a large range of different beasties but that has not discouraged me Im still out there trying to hug the world regardless of whether it hugs me back or not Maybe you are the same Hugs and bunnies to you too
