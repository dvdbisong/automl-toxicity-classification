BadVistaorg criticisms  moved from my personal talk page
Please refrain from adding BadVistaorg links or criticisms This situation has played out a long time back See the discussion archives for Windows Vista articles Most claims there are exaggerated and are not substantiated beyond a point Heck many have even been downright refuted Its plain and simple yellow journalism By consensus it is not considered a source reliable enough to be quoted in the article Plus nothing is there that has not already been covered Repeating them again is not neutral Please respect policy otherwise I am sorry to say this it will lead you to being blocked from editing here  talk 

Who are you to say which source is reliable Your act of filtering statements based on your own liking is against WPNPOV Also it appears Wikipedian likes to threaten a member as a way to welcome someone who tries to contribute Perhaps you have an interest in Microsoft business Bye  

Engage in discussion first before making unilateral changes to the article  talk 

There is no rule in Wikipedia to say we have to discuss first before we can edit the article Wikipedia says Be bold when editing the page Yours is against this rule Besides you also remove changes or do changes without discussing first This is a double standard I found no official source in Wikipeida which says BadVistaorg has been officially blacklisted or flagged as bad source Judging on your own liking is against WPNPOV  

Im going to move this part of discussion on the right page
