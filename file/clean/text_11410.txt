Oh dear Im glad you stuck around Gerda  Believe it or not I like to have an infobox in some articles too Sports geography science film etc I even considered one here but figured the box would look pretty short and redundant I do agree I have never been one for skirting around the issue and a more direct approach is sometimes needed However I am now deciding to steer clear of such discussions at ANI and other public places as it really is a never ending loop of the similar arguments you and I have seen many many times before  Your passion on the linked word would have been my passion as a review alas I dont think there is much more there for me If you can wait until FAC I would be pleased for a reminder then   Talk
