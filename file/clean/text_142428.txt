Carl_Paladinodiff388097440oldid388080941 October 1 and again on October 2 On Linda McMahon you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadnt protected the page on September 17 your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page but Im not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino       
Im not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring Moreover the combination of low speed and nonexplicit warnings are concerning Certainly the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas but Im not aware of any specific sanctionsenforcement which apply to these articles at the moment   
Sir  my history of edit warring was basically two years ago  20 total edits on a page Linda McMahon which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page   is a legitimate edit and not actionable at all  is also proper and a day earlier  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime and were absent for quite a while  leaving me in limbo  Frankly 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme   And for this use of block as punishment  I have doubts as to propriety thereof  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring  AFAICT he never even posted a single diff for his charge Thank you  now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit  Oh  look at this sort of editor I have had to face at   and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article    
This looks like a bad block and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin Is there any historyinvolvement per say with the blocking admin   
WRT asserting that Ohiostandard warned me  he never edited on the Paladino article nor mentioned it to me Right now the block is clearly punitive and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not edit war on my part I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years  and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone thinks I must be watched The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23   
Examples of current edits from others    And of course the current content of  Content of the emails in question includes video of dancing African tribesmen under the title Obama Inauguration Rehearsal a video titled Miss France 2008 Fucking an altered image of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama dressed as a pimp and a prostitute an image of a cargo plane landing in an African desert behind a group of panicked men titled Run Niggers Run and a video portraying a woman engaged in copulation with a horse  For some odd reason I had thought this was actually improper on WP  I take it that I was wrong if reverting such edits is edit war
