Unfortunately these two reviews are the newest ones available on trace amine receptors in relation to neuropsychiatry Im actually kind of puzzled as to why there isnt more activity in TAAR particularly TAAR1 research emphasis added only as highlights

If you happen to be interested in reading the full version of either paper I can give you a download link or email you the pdf The first one covers a lot more than just ADHD
