There is no intention from my side to canvass but I need to report the issue to you because I requested a 3O and you closed it because no discussion had place before As suggested I tried to convince User Direktor to explain me why he reverted my sourced edit but he replied that my English is too poor and I should not be permitted to write on enwiki I am now caught in a egg and a chicken situation no 3O because no talk had place before but no talk can have place because the counterpart refuses to discuss On top of that I cannot react to any insult because I do not want to dirt my hands
