FCC services 

If youre thinking of removing info relating to First Capital Connect please read carefully  I will only say this once
 FCC Thameslink services peak hours only from Moorgate to Farringdon Luton  Bedford have been withdrawn
 FCC Great Northern City Line services MonFri only from Moorgate to Old Street Finsbury Park and Welwyn have not and are not planned to be withdrawn
 In summary please stop removing references to any current National Rail service from the station Thank you
