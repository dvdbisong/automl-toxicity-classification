Maybe you are living in Newark 
I havent heard of Prudential before coming to USA because the company does not have the anvergure of a MeryllLynch or Goldman Sachs When the company is rather unknown its logo cannot be better Its not like we are talking about the MacDonalds M or the two circles for Mastercard or the hammer and the sickle It is a national company it could be your personal experience but this doesnt make it worthy of a worldwide encyclopedia Your propaganda is what will in the end make it a worldclass logo
