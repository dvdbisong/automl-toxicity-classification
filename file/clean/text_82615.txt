Making progress
Adding the links to the PLDD is itself not harmful Then again its not as useful as it could be if you just add a link to the page and leave it at that First thing you can do is to make people aware of the resource so that they can use it to write articles WikiProjects are a good place to leave a note Relevant ones include WikipediaWikiProject Middle Ages WikipediaWikiProject Saints WikipediaWikiProject Catholicism and WikipediaWikiProject Anglicanism Most will have a resources page somewhere listing useful books and links so mentioning PLDD in those would be helpful If you have a look at the history tabs of the articles on relevant subjects you can find editors who write about these things and may find them useful Please dont go mad A few messages will do look at who started or expanded the articles rather than people who did spelling corrections or the like

If you do add PLDD links to a page and you can see that theres some resistance to that idea you should probably do a few other things at the same time Make sure the article has a section on the relevant writings a bibliography of sorts Link to the Patrologia Latina article and then you can work in a mention of the PLDD version If you add a bibliography and the article has footnotes using  include a footnote and use the  or  templates rather than just adding a mention in External links Jonas of Orl√©ans is an example where there are mentions of the works in the PLDD and where adding a footnote saying where to find De cultu imaginum or De Institutione regia would be useful This would be more work for you but it would help us and our readers more I will change Jonas tomorrow to show what I mean and let you know when done If you have any questions please let me know It seems to me that the PLDD is a valuable resource for Wikipedias editors and readers or at least those who can read Latin and it would be regrettable we didnt make as much and as full use of it as possible Regards   Talk
