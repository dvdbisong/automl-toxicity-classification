Time for a Peer Review
It is now time for another peer review In particular I am interested to see opinions regarding whether the current article is overly biased in favor of the subject At the same time I think that it is necessary to establish for the reader why this particular individual is important After all it is quite a lot to read  Although I think that we have incorporated a good criticism section I want to ensure that this article reads like an encyclopedia article rather than a fan page
