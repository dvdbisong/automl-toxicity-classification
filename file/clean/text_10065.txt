Im going to edit based on my comments in TalkNew_antiSemitismSourcing_claims_for_22Countryspecific_incidents so could we discuss them now  

All the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new antiSemitism ie coming from the left related to radical antiZionism etc  talk 

They may well be but they are not sourced that way  

I dont think we can expect the words new antiSemitism to appear in every single report we reference Weve defined it and weve linked to many sources who are defining it The definition is

It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left It is characterized by the demonization of the worlds only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion Israels right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied The Jewish peoples right of selfdetermination is denied Double standards are applied whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state Symbols and images associated with classic antiSemitism are used for example blood libels are resurrected the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world or being in control of other governments or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others Arab and Islamic antiSemitism are excused and ignored Strawman attacks are made whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is antiSemitism and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable and to deny that there is any such thing as the new antiSemitism All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools particularly in Europe It is found in conjunction with antiAmericanism because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government antiZionism and the antiglobalization movement

All the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components so when we find them we can offer them as examples so long as someone has discussed them in terms of antiSemitism or attacks on Jews  talk 

My worry is that Livingstone has not been at least in the sources provided accused of antisemitism and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of antisemitism against his supporters  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of antisemitism not reporting others allegations which is OR and unwise in the case of Galloway  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new antisemitism so Id just want to tidy that up  

Livingstone has very definitely been accused of antiSemitism got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it as has Galloway and without question his supporters The section talks about it in relation to that election By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit and we can talk later if there are any disagreements  talk 

Slim whose definition is this   

All the sources put together The above are the issues they agree on It was posted weeks ago  talk 

I think you mean all the sources from one side of the argument put together  Its been a while since we discussed this so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative   
Sorry youll have to look in the archives theyre either there or in the article By all the sources I mean all the sources who study new antiSemitism The above are the elements they appear to agree on  talk 
Im asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative  Please respond  UserC
