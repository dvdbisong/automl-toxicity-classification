Given the unique nature of comicbook material we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources  Its only when those articles seeks something beyond a C such as GA or FA status that thirdparty sources become imperative  Now give many of the minor superhero character pages out there are really stubs with little future its all about where you stand on the inclusionistdeletionist philosophy on Wikipedia  Do you give leeway to smallinterest articles in because we have nearly infinite resources or do you hold everything to the rules  Personally I lean more toward keeps than deletes except for extreme cases

In any case I Rictor may pass for GA  You can check out a similar character I worked on and moved to GA Anole comics  That really go there because I trimmed through FCH and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the characters creation  The layout for an FA article would probably cut through a lot of character history and focus on publication history  It offends some people to see what they consider notable character history cut but if you want an accessible article you have to do it  Superman arguably has a ton of character history but its really just distilled down to the basic iconic things that others write about Krypton orphan country boy Metropolis Louis Lane Lex Luther Justice League etc  Im trying to find the time to do the same to Jean Grey  I populated her Publication History and that means ripping out a lot of that enormous Character History section  Just some musings
