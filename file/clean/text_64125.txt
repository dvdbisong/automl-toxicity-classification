But in general there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors or between even and odd when it comes to integrands  An example in one dimension when  and  is

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor or odd tensor density but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher in a higherdimensional example they would be no longer righthanded  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor or even tensor density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order b  a in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining righthandedness  The usual convention Ive seen is to keep the coordinates righthanded and to transform the integrand as a pseudotensor density but the other approach is equally valid   talk  contribs
