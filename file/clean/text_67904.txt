Opinion that the judges report is biased Thats not an opinion its an obvious fact Thats the whole purpose of the report The finding of the court was guilty and the report attempts to justify the courts findings The prosecutions argument and the judges conclusion are one and the same You cant get any more biased than that Thats the reason for the WPBLP prohibition on use of court records to support assertions about a living person And anything in the report that it claims is evidence or circumstance that leads to the guilty conclusion is an assertion about a living person Please step back and look at it logically Lack of an alternate RS is NOT justification to demand that you be allowed to use a prohibited biased source That would be the same as someone else demanding to use injusticeinpeurgiaorg as a RS unless YOU can provide an alternate for the same information
