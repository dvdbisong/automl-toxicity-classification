Similar practices in places other than India 

I am curious to know that is there any similar practice or phenomenon of kidnapping men to marry women excluding Shotgun wedding which I mean to force the man who impregnated ones daughter to marry her and regardless of whether the man has met the woman or not that existed or still exists in places other than India
