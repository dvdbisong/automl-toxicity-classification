I also find it somewhat unimpressive that you closed bith discussions about abuse with comments directed at me rather than the problem of the abuse I submitted Nicely played no one wants to enforce abusive admins And regardless of whether he used his tools abusively in this situation he has done so many times in the past and he is an abusive editor as are the others I mentioned in the discussion It would be nice if for once someone was actually willing to do something about that and their passive aggressive bullshit arguments and insults rather than persecute the submitter for being blunt when submitting them to ANI They are saying the same things that is calling me an asshole they are just doing it in a different way Typical for this site these days
