What is wrong with Croatia 

I have a question  What is wrong with Croatia or what is wrong with Croats on this matter

Everywhere I go France Italy USA and especially Britain I experience discrimination on the fact that I am a Croat Is this a common state of mind in the world on account of exYugoslavs or is this just something against Croatia and Croats Please if someone can answer me truthfully and honestly without any selfrestraint on account of bon ton because I would really like to know 

Thanks in advance
