This is really pathetic  I posted in good faith with my real name a link to a newly created page NOT an external site That page was describing in NPOV terms a service similar to the ones also linked from the blog software page Then within minutes I get called spammer on a page that you ohsoconveniently deleted now  and to add insult to injury you add this nastygram on my user page No one explained which clause of the innumerable rules I broke  its so much more convenient to call someone a spammer after doing a 2 second Google search What other words to describe you but lame To think I help Wikipedia when it was still adjoint to Nupedia I wonder what the other companies did to get listed on your blog software page Remind me how much is it again
