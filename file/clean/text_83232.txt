This scanned 1848 book says manors of Barew and Inglescombe or Englishcombe and the Englishcome village website suggests the Duchy owns property in that area so it looks the same  By google hit count neither version seems overwhelmingly popular and both still seem in current use  I suggest following the Duchy source with Englishcombe in brackets  Ill do that but change it if you prefer another way  NB Newton St Loe is exceptionally pretty to walk around on a sunny day if you pass that way
