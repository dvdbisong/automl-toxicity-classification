Again what you are referring to is the branding of a university There are plenty of examples where shields of CoA was used In fact the CoA was proudly display in a convocation ceremony picture on your website  As well you should referred to TemplateInfobox university where it defines logo as corporate emblem and image as universitys official seal or logo The CoA as granted by the Governor General is the official seal of the university If you wish to dispute that feel free to provide examples of parchments or official documents under seals where the branding is used I am otherwise unconvinced that your message represents nothing more than a commerical representation of the branding exercise
