Conversion to GBP 

I have removed the following text because I not only cant find anything to back it up but also because I am aware of specific instructions to the contrary

The Falkland pound has always been equivalent to the Pound sterling

Reasoning
 OANDA specifically quote a FKPGBP rate which differs over time
 I work for a UK clearing bank and we are certainly aware of the procedure  daily exchange rates for FKP are sent to us
