Support but change disambiguation  If I can interject Id like to add that I can see good arguments raised by both sides in this discussion from what I have read so far 

The current title used has a natural disambiguation which is always preferable in an article name and obeys WPTITLE and WPNATURAL I dont wish to make a statement without any evidence to support it but where I come from everyone knows what the term Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant means and what it represents so its not unpopular The acronym ISIL is also accurate enough to represent the group That being said I have started to notice that both these terms are being displaced by ISIS Islamic State and IS in publications that I read and news that I tune in to Many reliable sources are also starting to refer to it as Islamic State with many many different variants The other fact that also should be considered here is the actual wording in the name Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant makes the group sound as if it is geographically locked in these two regions with no territory or ambition to spread outside of its primary spheres of influence Similar to the Talibancontrolled Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan And dare I say it also makes them sound more legitimate as a group then just the ambiguous Islamic State designation due to the emphasis placed upon the areas of Iraq and the Levant Makes it sound more formal But it is now not the case As multiple editors have stated it is not merely a parochial militant group with territory in the regions of Iraq Syria and now even parts of Lebanon but a transnational entity bent on expansion I cannot see how relegating it to two geographic positions is the mature thing to do in an Encyclopedia whatever the intention It is becuase of this that I do not believe the current name and its disambiguation is viable anymore purely for this reason Some editors had stated the potential and very real problem of justifying Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant territory outside of Iraq and the Levant Its not a recognized entity as far as I know You cannot liken it to the Russian Federation having territory outside of Russia in Europe eg Kaliningrad or the United States having territory outside of North America eg Hawaii What I am getting at is that this implies a level of legitimate ownership and this group doesnt have it Not in Libya or Yemen or Iraq or Syria or anywhere

The issue I have with Islamic State IS is the disambiguation which whilst being a widely used acronym for the group can not be measured accurately to satisfy WPCOMMONAME through Google searches alone Even though many sources use IS which has been stated on its own as a disambiguation it is simply too generic A similar issue arises with the term Islamic State However were you to isolate the period for a search the results would become more accurate and this has already been stated If a more appropriate disambiguation were to be found that could in concise terms explain what the article is about I would support it I suggest something along the lines of Islamic State organisation or Islamic State ISIS or Islamic State group or Islamic State militant group I am under the impression that WPOFFICIAL and WPCOMMONAME are the important policies here as editor  stated and in my opinion the current title doesnt satisfy either whilst a proposed title has the potential to satisfy both 

The only reason why I choose to support this current proposal is that progress towards a better article name will emerge allot quicker were it Islamic State IS vs a proposed alternative rather than the current title vs a proposed alternative
