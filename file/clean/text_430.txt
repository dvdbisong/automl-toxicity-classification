Unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once 

Frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your AGFviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or David Gerard for claiming that I am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others Its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things

If you want to start blocking for incivility I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her or the sysop whose very talk page says hes going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page Rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions
