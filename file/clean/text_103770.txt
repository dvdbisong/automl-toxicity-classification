LOL gee I wish you were part of WPCanada  Ive tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down rather patronizingly too  Theyre supposed to be parallel to People from Whatcom County or People from Oxfordshire but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are especially not in terms of any selfreferential this is where Im from sense  Unless you mean all people from XXX categoriesin the case of regional districts which have only existed since 18671968 and also do not include Indian Reserves in their governance and have extremely limited powers sewer zoning some planning and disaster management theyre not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with Indian Reserves or people from them some users like UserBackspace and I got into something like edit wars over hisher labelling objects like mountains lakes etc with them and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way different branch of the governance system namely Ministry of Environment theres also ysee Forest Districts and Forest Regions Land Districts which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind Ministry of Environment Regions for parks theoretically but BC Parks has its own system within MoE Health Regions hospitals etc School Districts Counties which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life Development Regions which ARE relevant to daily life and provinciallykept statistics though teyre formed from aglloomerationsboundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively and BC Tourism httpwwwhellobccom has its OWN system of regions  The rationale provided by the regional district categoriesdefenders is that because its the system that StatsCan uses to divvy up BC for the census ie counting people then it makes sense to use them as geographic subdivisions for where people are from  But it just doesnt make sensethe problem now is that theres all kinds of mirrored wikiclones which ahve statments like XXX Mountain is a mountain in the suchandso regional district though the more relevant reference is in the suchandso mountain range or in the xxx CountryValley in BC theres lots of historical regionreferences of the Nicola Country Shuswap Country Omineca Country type sometimes capitalized though often not and often just the Shuswap the Okanagan the Omineca etc and regional district names and also electoral district names are often built out of them eg ColumbiaShuswap OkanaganSimilkameen but Ive also seen translated categoriesarticles saying Fraser Valley when meaning the Fraser Valley Regional District the problem is that only half of the Fraser Valley is even IN the regional district of that name the rest is in the Greater Vancouver one and similarly the Cariboo Regional District doesnt include all of the Cariboo and itself includes a region known as the Chilcotin  Ive created categories for most of those areas and a parallel hierachy for same but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries cant be cited easily even though theyre what people actually use and historically predate even the province itselftheres some subcategories using that format eg CategoryPeople from the Similkameen where the Similkameen  the Similkameen Country and also CategoryCariboo people although thats largely intended for historical figures from that regions glory days during the Cariboo Gold Rush and since  In the way British Columbians actually talk soandso is from the ThompsonNicola Regional District would mean that that person WORKS for the ThompsonNicola Regional District most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person  Myself Id like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that the rationale is that some other longago Wikipedian created the hierarchy and so we should respect that even though that person to me was utterly clueless and shouldnt have created them at all  The only thing the main RD categories should be used for is the component municipalities though there are some Electoral Areas that have articles but tis when those start getting used as geographic descriptors its entirely offbase its all over Googlemaps and Wikimaps too and its really annoying to see similarly the use of the Frenchform of Indian Reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hells half digital acreage because its what StatsCan wrongly uses  As if StatsCan were the only classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in Ottawa doanyway sorry for the rant its been rare for me to find
