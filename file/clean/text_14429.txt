Here is a summary of a few notes found in the archive
Guerreros reign With the victory Cena earns a World Championship opportunity against the titleholder of his choice at WrestleMania XXIV on Sunday March 30 in Orlando Florida but which champion will he choose to face Will he go after the WWE Championship  currently held by Randy Orton  and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it Or will Cena look to conquer a different mountain and challenge an old foe World Heavyweight Champion Edge or a new kingpin ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero for a title he has never worn
Kanes reign Then theres the state of the ECW Championship held by Kane who was also drafted over to Raw on Monday Although ECW gained the services of United States Champion Matt Hardy the Land of the Extreme is now left with no World Champion of their own and only a oneinthree chance to win it back at Night of Champions On Sunday the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry While the Worlds Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown the Worlds Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesdays Supplemental Draft and is that brands chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme But if Triple H Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold
Morrisons reign Fast Forward to 330 These accolades are only fitting of a true champion and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim I am a World Champion I am the new face of ECW I am the ECW World Heavyweight Champion

Once again WWE recognized the ECW title to be a world heavyweight championship throughout its existence until the discontinuation of the brand which resulted in all references pertaining to ECW being removed from WWE programming soon thereafter However as noted above this is called retconing and it is something Wikipedia policy prohibits in this scenario for the purpose of historical accuracyTruth
