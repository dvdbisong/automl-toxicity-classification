Australia 

The section Australia begins  However section nine of the Statute of Westminster allowed the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 to have continued application in the six Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory this allowed the British parliament to continue to pass legislation concerning the states and territory   But s 9 mentions only the states  And if the statement is correct for the ACT which I doubt presumably it would also be correct for the other territories so that they too should be mentioned  Any objection to removing the words and the Australian Capital Territory and and territory
