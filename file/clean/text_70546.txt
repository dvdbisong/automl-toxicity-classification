Sure First Im not Chomsky or Finkelstein but their POV is similar to mine on many issues But to explain my POVand I hope Im logicalIm against all States Im not an anarchist either I see States as a necessary evil given the current state of human civilization But they should not be glorified as a an end but as a means to an end the end being peace security for ALL democracy people before profits equality ect progressive values 

States should never be supported when they rest on the oppresssion of others I oppose all conquest and imperialism past and present As far as states created by conquest what is important is current oppression ie  ending itesp statesponsored that are in the bussiness of building based on conquest of others This must be opposed equally in all cases which a special responsiblity for those you can have the greatest effect in changing stoping ie if I live in the US I have a special responsiblity to speak out against things this countries does directly or indirectly as in the case of support for Israeli occupation

As for the meaning of a national homeland it could mean the country of origin and native land of a people who have a strong cultural connection and history within such a territory  a cultural geography There are many ethnic groups who holds a long history and a deep cultural association different country or geographical regions in particular where the national identity began And diffferent groups can live in peace side to side with different language cultures coexisting with the same country united under the common accepted cultural norms of democratic values This does not negate a national homeland only having it based on the oppression of others Hence Im able to be for a national homeland for the Jewish people in the land of Israel while at the same time Im antiZionist and advocate for a binational state
