I noticed your comment on another users talk page who in turn spoke to me Please do not encourage POVdriven participation and do not make unfounded allegations of POVbias Please take note of WPAGF WPNPOV and WPRS Information in an article which can potentially be called slander if unfounded needs to be supported with highly credible sources Too much of the information youve readded are unsourced others are supported by sources that dont speak to the content youre adding Do not use content from sources and then draw your own interpretations of what they mean Also bear in mind that sources that come from editorials or opinion pieces need to be represented in the article as opinions not relayed as fact This is particularly the case when the source has a clearly partisan allegience
