Honestly Id be tempted to remove those too Now there may be exceptions as there surely are but in most cases a forum discussion will not meet the criteria for a good external link Its an interesting debate to be sure but for a start it might look entirely different a year from now Secondly theres nothing really provable to say these people are more expert on the matter than say my friends over at the Return to Castle Wolfenstein forum  As for the Silver Star text Im hoping to find time to look over the article again in detail soon and that is one of the things I may replace with the simple external link or at the very least condense Best regards  ลข ร
