You can twist and bend it all you want Doesnt change the facts bub   

See where Im getting Now I will edit this article once more and should you revert it I will be taking it up with higher authorities Thanks for your understanding in the issue 

Furthermore they dont need to identify themselves as muslims when they have declared Islamic JIHAD you fool 

Again I ask you to please provide a reputable source indicating that any of the hostagetakers ever declared a Jihad  as I said it seems they never said the bare prayers to even be devout Muslims in fact I havent yet seen any reference to any of the hostagetakers saying a single word in Arabic which would be odd for a Islamic Jihadist terrorist to say the least  talk bounties

I provided proof Look up And of course you wouldnt see anything in the press to indicate their Islamic religion after all it was John Williams and his aide who drew pictures of Osama instead of John Muhammad who terrorized Washington DC some time ago
