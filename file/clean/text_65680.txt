Well it has been a little bit since Ive actually read this whole article so I dont feel I can make a judgement on whether or not it should have a POV tag However if you think it is POV Id say keep the tag as long as you specifically explain why you have applied the tag Then work with others here to find consensus about article content I will check out the article and check back in here in a little bit And dont defer to me just because I have been here a little longer than you I am just a lowly editor trying to make the world a more NPOV place Cheers  Dark Mark
