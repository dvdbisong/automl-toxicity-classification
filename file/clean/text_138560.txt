Stop and desist from your arbitrary edits 
I have noticed you have willfully cut text from the valueform article because it is not to your taste A sentence such as Thus Marx aims to provide a brief morphology of the category of economic value as such from the simplest forms to the moneyform is removed with the comment synthetsis and bluster This is not acceptable and if you do not desist from your objectionable editing work action will be taken
