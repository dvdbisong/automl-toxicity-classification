you said I think LAEC has a valid point that there is an undisclosed COI from those editors but its not like that doesnt happen anywhere else  I agree  What makes this case different however and therefore newsworthy is that person involved is a major player in a major organization and that organization is a national leader in opposing the very things that its own high ranking member does when she acts anonymously  For example the ALA opposed outing a 911 terrorist to the police when that persons own deputy outed a major sports figure on Wikipedia for marital infidelity  For example the ALA promotes intellectual freedom while anonymously propgandizing on Wikipedia to promote its own political interests I appreciate the support and guidance you have provided
