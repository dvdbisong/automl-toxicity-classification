Hi These maps are a definite improvement over the prior D Liuzzo orange locator maps I am also trying to create new locator maps for European countries resembling the locator maps used for most other countries eg with greengrey colour scheme  this is being discussed ad nauseum at Netherlands however nothing is set in stone Perhaps you want to place your map there and or collaborate to create new ones Thanks
