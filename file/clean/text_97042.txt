The erosion of African names also occurred Samba meaning comfort in Wolof is still recalled in musical form in Brazil where there remains a strong African presence A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo SouthernCentral Africa which also means to give comfort Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 18611865 Sambos Right To Be Kilt and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo

This article must be deleted immediately or a disambiguation tag added to it as in the Samba Dance article  I call for the former because the name is African in origin and in African society it does not mean what this article is purporting it to mean 

Thank you
