Inconsistencies regarding the alleged hoaxes 

The article includes three entries under UFO hoaxes  Two of those entries have Wikipedia pages but if you check those pages theres no proof offered that they are indeed hoaxes  For Adamskis page there is at least the fact that his claims about Venus etc are inconsistent with later observations

I think the UFO page should either mark these as alleged hoaxes or the Adamski and Meier pages should more clearly state why the preponderance of evidence points to hoax  

Sorry but I dont know the cases well enough to contribute the changes myself
