The discussion of when there first were outdoor trees with electric lights is very strange 1956 are you kidding and some obscure town in NC I dont think this makes much sense especially since the sentences immediately preceding these establish that other cities had electrically lighted outdoor Christmas trees in the early years of the 20th century The article cited for the North Carolina town if read carefully really only states that the tradition of having outdoor lighted trees IN THAT SPECIFIC TOWN began in 1956 not that the town claims it was the first place to have such trees I am old enough to have been around in 1956 though I was a small boy and I can tell you that we and our neighbors in Southern California had lighted outdoor trees prior to 1956 and no one thought it remarkable or unusual The history here is questionable to say the least
