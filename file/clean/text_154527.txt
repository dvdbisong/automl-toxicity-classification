People who criticize Wikipedia are usually uneducated sloths of the lowest possible order Of course the great unwashed masses are suspicious of it it is too smart for them The WalMart shopping gun rack owning beer drinking Jesus freaks who cant get enough of NASCAR wouldnt understand intellect if it bit them on their Big Mac eating asses
This is why there are so many pointless edit wars This is why people hate wikipedia Superiority complex you got that from those japs
