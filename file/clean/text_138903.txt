Salut 

Hi Dc76 About Anittas I regret very much what happened to him and I maintain that he was dealt with too harshly and I intended to protest his indefinite block However he informed me that he has decided to leave Wikipedia and that even if the block can be shortened that he is not interested in returning I find his decision unfortunate but that is his own choice 

As for Moldova thanks for your offer of help The article is in a rather sorry state and I always had it at the top of my list but never quite got around to it Indeed there is much work to be done I am trying to make the article follow the guidelines listed on WikipediaWikiProject Countries As my model I have other featured articles on countries such as Belgium Turkey and Germany The problem is that now there is little structure to the Moldova article and much random and some inaccurate information Of course if there is relevant data I dont want it lost so if its just too detailed for the main article it should be moved to the subarticles My idea for a schedule was to first create the skeleton of the article meaning that only the sections from the Countries projects should be kept and rest integrated or moved Then all the sections need to be reworked some to be expanded others made more compact others need sources and most existing sources need to be changed to standard formats Then various issues of style need to be changed ie to make the article pretty which means finding some nice images making the tables look nicer etc And finally the article will need to be copyedited and checked for errors So if you want to help it would be great if you could work on any of those aspects or any other See you around
