Whatever you do do not leave me a message

1044 EST April 15 2008  I keep finding pages that have been deleted  I just added a unreferenced tag to a Wiki deletion policy page  Im sure Im not the first person to think of this  What degree of crap will be flung can only be imagined   

I undid your edit to ignore all rules as it was not in the spirit of Wikipedia  See WikipediaDo not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point

That should be WikipediaWhat Ignore all rules means  Please sign your entries by typing four tildes
  

Have you read WikipediaPlease do not bite the newcomers yet
  

 Except when you violate the rules about creating articles 

You said Except when you violate the rules about creating articles in which case the page in violation will be quickly deleted leaving no trace of what occurred Even the conversation about it may be deleted forever This comment like everything else on this page does not cite sources This comment may also be in violation of some rule

Thats an interesting point Several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already Will you be helping out with that   

 Hi Kim  I dont know what looking into even means in regards to Wikipedia I dont know who people are who does what or who created the rules  I dont know what helping out means in regards to your question

My first effort here at creating an entry was put up for deletion in 4 minutes then deleted without discussion by some admin  Now I cant find the brief discussion about that 

But it led to the realization that many many pages here the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia dont cite sources  The pages dont list authors either  They are nebulous pages that dont follow the rules those pages insist I follow

Interesting  Damn right it is interesting  Ive read a lot of criticism of wiki and defended wikipedia for years  But now well I see a huge flaw in the system

The only links I saw in the article the one on Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seemed to work fine now Were there other ones you were thinking of   

I answered on your talk page  

 Cornfused I tell you

 Is userNakon some kind of Bot 

I have no idea what happens on Wikipedia sometimes  While reading the ALS entry due to a friend having been diagnosed with it I followed a link to the ALS Association which gave me that page that says there is no article  I looked it up on Google and created a short starter page on it  

Right after I hit create I realized there was already an entry but it was under ALS Association so I hit edit this page to make it a redirect It came up as deleted  In a matter of seconds some asswipe called Nakon had deleted the page

Deletion log 0328   Nakon  deleted The ALS Association CSD A7 Corp Article about a company that doesnt assert significance

Considering there already was a page and it certainly is significant the ultrafast deletion is an example of some kind of fucked up mentality  This idiot has to be using some kind of software to scan every new article and she must have spent 2 seconds before hitting some sort of deletion key

Unbelievable  This level of bullshit goes beyond anything I have ever encountered on the Internet before  If I had changed the entry to a redirect I would have missed the event

I use Wikipedia all the time but I spend almost no time editing or creating pages  Most of the changes I have made over the years have been fixing minor mistakes or reverting vandalism  Having managed to avoid ever being drawn into the
