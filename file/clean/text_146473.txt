First and foremost there is not and never has been any Wikistalking This is paranoia on Chadbryants part and has been present in numerous remarks he has made not just those dealing with reverting I do find it humorous however that he has to claim Wikistalking yet he has a history of reverting an article in an edit war but trying to claim he is in no violation of a 3RR rule as a result of his changing nonexistant vandalism

Second of all I did not attack his talk page You may go and see the history of the page if you wish to verify this but all I did was make a comment that was not in agreement with what he said Because he dislikes me and because of his paranoia AND possibly because of other reasons which I wont go into because hed just cry about personal attacks he removed the comments I made All because they didnt go with what he said and believed This was immature selfish childish and stupid at best but as I said on another page if he wants to look that way who am I to stop him

Then there is this appeared as another blah blah blah as soon as blah blah blah Isnt this funny or what He has to go and request a checkuser because he cant tell who is who yet he has no problem pulling out the sockpuppet accusation and whipping it around like a cowboys lasso at a rodeo Of course theres no WAY Chad could ever be  despite evidence pointing towards him For it would be unthinkable for someone to directly accuse him of the same behavior of which he so loves to accuse others

Made allegations of stalking      to paint himself as a victim Did Chad even read what he wrote Did he realize that he claims I made allegations of stalking to paint myself as a victim yet in the same remarks he claims Wikistalking on himself I mean you just gotta laugh sometimes at these things you know But being a hypocrite is nothing new to him

As for the attacking of the external link  he still has no proof I am that person who he claims that I am This is the same debacle he got into with  And how fucking funny is it for him to claim I am that person yet three paragraphs later he has to go and claim a checkuser  

You get the idea I hopethink This is stupid but when you are dealing with Chadbryant you have to expect that
