Like an editor said above some al qaeda are involved in the oposition to him no doubt some al qaeda members came from libya that is a fact  but that is not the same as al qaeda being a full belligerent  the uprising began  Panorama had a full programme on it Fighting Gaddafi you should watch it  when yellow hats police fired on unarmed ptoesters in Benghazi they fired at a human rights protest over a massacre of dissenters in 1996 then it escalated when authorities launched a crackdown  3 days of killing  then though unarmed using benzine and bulldozers they beat the police and gaddafi soldiers   gaddafi began to call them terrorists scum al qaeda  if the UN hadnt intervened he would have  wiped benghazi out get ready we are coming tonight to hunt for the scum etc  and in the time since  there has been no story that however it began since then al qaeda have assumed a significant  full belligerent role there just is no RS  material for that story  you put al qaeda as a full belligerent  because of  good faith edits  bloody hell those are probably Gaddafiite edits  ever thought of that
