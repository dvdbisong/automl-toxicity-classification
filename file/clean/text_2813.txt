I havent tried MP yet Will do after completion of the main story Did any of you to see the the way Joker assaulted Roman I almost closed my eyes at the brutality of it And was absolutely shocked at what Joker did to Buchinskyjust amazed at how badass that was The circus mill is something that Im not really a fan of A great chunk of the Copperhead boss fight was incorporated from the Ras al GhÅ«l boss fight Almost died too but held on to two bars of health I have to say that Im quite anxious to see how things will play out from here on Ill get to play in a couple hours  cant now because I have a swimming class Nevertheless Im going to try Blackgate after Origins as my brother preordered for 3DS Ill try to find a strong page of reviews for Blackgate as well Havent really seen any good reviews for Blackgate but my brother says that its worth it So well look at that Ive also been seeing a lot of unsourced or poorly written content being added to Origins page Cant complain too much as I did anticipate it Ill be getting back to gaming soon
