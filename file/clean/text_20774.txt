Thanks That looks much better now I never thought of linking to Before the Golden Age or the robot names Amazing the depth Wikipedia has in some areas I have the volumes of Asimovs biography but havent had a chance to read them yet One more thing the article on Before the Golden Age says it was later published in 3 paperbacks Maybe that was in the US because the UK volumes I have are 1 3 and 4 Sadly Im missing volume 2
