Edit to Maverick 

It absolutely DOES matter that Mavericks are not Mustangs If people want to read about Mustangs they can look up Mustangs on Wikipedia There is absolutely NO reason to have Mustang notes on a Maverick article In fact its ridiculous and it just clutters up the page I am not a vandal I just hate seeing information listed which does not pertain to the subject
