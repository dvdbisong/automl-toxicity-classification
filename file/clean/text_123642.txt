Well there are more than five hundred lines in this link you mentioned talking about many opinions and you just pick up two lines containing the word homoerotic that I dont know which idiot has written 
Now let me give you another link  where they precisely talk about ghazal its formation and its particularities And they mention 
The idealized beloved in the ghazal tradition is typically a woman or God
And then why is it believed to be homoerotic
The use of masculine grammatical structures suggests that many poems carry homoerotic undertones
As I said it is the structure of the persian language which does not have any distinction between genders which has made some socalled scholars probably those with an agenda not related to mystic poetry to makeing a deliberate mistake of talking about masculin grammatical structure while it is neutral in persian Neutral meaning precisely that if a man wrote it The idealized beloved in the ghazal tradition is typically a woman or God
And the paragraph ends by 
The ghazal rarely speaks about specific encounters rather it conceives of love as a metaphor for interactions among humans God and the world
How about you Haiduc  going a little bit further in your analysis than just fulfilling your agenda as I know your contribution in wikipedia very well and looking for the word homoerotic
