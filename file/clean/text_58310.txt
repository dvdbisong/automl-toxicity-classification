Deletion of Wedu 
Dear Jimfbleak I have already been discussing this matter with see the talk on my userferromario and I am implementing the advices about Wedu one by one as they are risen So far I have so far found really helpful when an editor suggests a change before deleting an entry because that gives time to correct or improve the entry So far I have found the approach of both  and  very helpful 

I understand that you are working in the interest of the community trying to be productive and effective Your advice on the referencing is really helpful I cannot implement it now since the page is deleted Would you please reopen it and I will be happy to implement your suggestions Thank you

I am copying this message also in my personal talk area so if you wish we can continue there All the best
