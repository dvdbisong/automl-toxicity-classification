The original comment is absolutely correct  global warming without any qualification should refer to any planet at any point in spacetime Most of spacetime is inaccessible to us at least in practice but for example an article titled Global warming should at least include the timing causes and progress of GW on Venus and at various times in the Earths history when geochmical and fossil evidence indicate that GW probably occurred
Of course thats only logic I dont expect it will change the content of this article or lead to most of its current content being moved to eg The debate about contemporary global warming on Earth
