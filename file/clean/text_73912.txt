Please note that Mileys article is referenced in Nuclear Energy Encyclopedia Science Technology and Applications edited by Steven Krivit and Jay H Lehr page 538 reference number 132 And Krivit put Mileys articles in the Selected Papers section of his New Energy Times website because he believes that Mileys article is scientifically important and I concur with his judgment If you think that you are smarter than Krivit then you just go ahead and delete the reference to Mileys article on transmutations in thin films
