Typical values for Earths atmosphere 

Does anybody know typical values for n and d in the atmosphere of Earth Is the refractive index of the particle the same as that of air approx 10003 at sea level or is a different value to be used for a single particle In general it would be nice if one could use the formula along with these values to make calculations with these Getting information via Google about this seems to be very difficult either the information is only about the principle but without numbers or it is drowning in details or you have to pay for it or Googles hit is about a completely different topic so it would be nice if Wikipedia could provide such useful information If I had such information I surely would add it to the article but unfortunately I dont have any
