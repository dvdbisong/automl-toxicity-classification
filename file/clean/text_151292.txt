Bartle Bogle Hegarty 

hello thankyou for your help with my entry for bbh being new to this i must admit to getting a little lost a couple of things if possible the company is actually reffered to as BBH the bartle bogle hegarty part was its old name so ideally the page should be called BBH i had a problem finding the page in the search option it seemed to jump to another company that use BBH is it possible to change this so both BBHs appear as 100 also now you have changed the page name do other pages in wiki that i linked to this page no longer link

would love the opportunity to ask more advice if possible could we talk on email peterogersbbhcouk
