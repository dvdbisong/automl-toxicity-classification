Ehh there was a misadventure a while back where my buddy Biruitorul and I were amusing ourselves by satirizing the ongoing dramatic soap opera that is Wikipedia in the form of a gloriously overwrought naval epic Horatio Hornblower meets Dr Strangelove It was a lot of fun we caricatured ourselves just as mercilessly as we did our antagonists brought in one ludicrous plot twist after another in one chapter some Arrow Cross pirates boarded my ship and tied me up meanwhile Biru had been seized by even more religious fervor than usual and was heading off to retake Constantinople for Orthodoxy We got a little carried away and ended up in a bit of hot water but no harm done really
