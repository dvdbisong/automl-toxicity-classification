Shocked
I am a regular wikipedia user and despite having an EB account find myself using wikipedia increasingly as a source of generally impartial factual information That opinion took a nosedive today when I came across this article in Wikipedia while looking for information on ear protection 

If I want to find out about Bose headphones or any other product I will go to their web site  I dont expect to find a companies product range specification in an encyclopedia One can easily imagine the impact if every company starts using wikipedia as a site to promote their products under the guise of giving facts to the reader 

The FACT is I dont care whether this so called article is written from a NPOV or not whether its balanced or nor or even whether it is factually correct or not  I DO care that my favourite encyclopedia is being abused under the specious argument that if its a fact it somehow deserves a place here I can think of a hundreds of types of completely factual information that I dont want to see cluttering up wikipedia and marketing information is pretty close to the top of the list
