Theres nothing rude or uncivilized about my above comment You reverted my edit plain and simple I know your new to wikipedia and im trying to help you but do not undo edits ex if you dont know what you are doing If you feel so strongly about it take it to the talk page otherwise let it die Also note saying people are rude and uncivilized if you say it to the right person will get you blocked Im sorry if I come off mean but you shouldnt just undo peoples edits ex when you are in the wrongdont know what you are doing which is obviously the case here
