Hello 
But I didnt find excuses I just mentioned that it is quite strange for me to hear that I need to improve my English but I write historical articles mainly not technical As I am not a native speaker in English I should improve it for sure of course Your example illustrates not the grammar mistakes or errors this almost never happened but use of the words which should be fully adequate to context With this I can agree indeed because I translate texts from Russian into English sometimes directly In Russian article the original phrase was strengthened turret armour means that it was more thick than hull armour and turret side armour 

I need one advice  I would like to replace Obyekt with more understandable for readers Object everywhere What do you think about this
Regards
