UserAnothersliceofhistory sockpuppet case 

I offered to close the case as a gesture of good will given that the user was decrying Wikipedia and leaving The preponderance of evidence points to the fact they were sockpuppets and I still believe so The two worked in synchronized lockstep in the two articles they edited They edited the pages with identical changes to avoid the 3RR rule If you review TalkDavid VitterRfC Can the David Vitter section discussing the earmark for the Louisiana Family Forum state that LFF combats evolution and that ties existed between the two I believe I showed patience defending a sourced section against two identical sounding editors who decried the leftwing conspiracies of the New Orleans paper The TimesPicayune and the importance of TRUTH their caps over verification You should notice on the talk page that I patiently discussed the standard policies of Wikipedia to no avail I attempted to corral their many concerns into separate sections to reach consensus These users are members of the Louisiana Family Forum predicated that they are sockpuppets

I believe you are being gamed if you take at face value what this user says about his background If you feel after investigating the talk page that I did not work in good faith then I will accept your determination and advice and adjust how I handle protecting a page from vandalism in the future Thanks   talk
