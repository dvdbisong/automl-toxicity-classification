Illyrians 

Illyrians Hi how are your doing I wonder if you can help me with one dispute In the article about Illyrians under one of the sections I together with a Greek user of Wikipedia have wrote that according to Britannica Albanians are direct descendents of Illyrians I have sourced everything I wrote But some are removing this all the time and claiming assimilation of Illyrians by Serbs without providing any source and saying Britannica is outdated and not reliable I wonder if you can do something with this Maybe protect the article or tell those people that Britannica is reliable Thanks in advance
