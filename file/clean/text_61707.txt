Weird I deal with governmental agencies for a business and it happens that we get notices when we fail to comply with something and we fix it and it is not serious It would become so if we didnt respond The report did not find any intentional failure to comply As an example one of the advertisements was an announcement by a governmental body Such announcements might ordinarily be allowed However that governmental body also provides funding for the radio station So was this an advertisement The report considered it so But it is easy to see how the station personnel may have failed to so consider it and thus to tag it The report found no pattern of noncompliance Just how serious this all was might be measured by the response to it in the radio community which seems to be that the report was favorable to 8TOP From the report Two of the complaints also alleged that the service was failing to represent its community interest in line with its licence conditions However ACMAs investigation found that the licensee was meeting the requirements of this licence condition 8TOPs licence was renewed by ACMA for a period of five years commencing on 2 August 2008 Essentially the breaches were an insufficient system for soliciting and incorporating community input and two untagged announcements by sponsors But possibly more The real key is no sanctions No fines no special conditions and no revocation of license or immediate threat of same
