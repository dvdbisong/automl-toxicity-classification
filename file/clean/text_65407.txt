Dutch Gold
You claim in the article that it is in fact Orangeboom that manufactures the beer Have you a citation for this Also you claim that the brewery mentioned on the can is a fictional one Is this true I find this all very interesting and as you are Dutch you know better than I do but Id like some references if at all possible regards
