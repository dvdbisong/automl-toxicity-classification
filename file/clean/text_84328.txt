Update OK since I couldnt remember them I got ahold of my schools bell schedule None of the vandalism occured on a Wednesday which is Advisory day at my school That basically just fouls up the bell schedule and cuts 15 minutes from two periods The significance of that information is that I now dont have a much more narrow list of rooms to look at The incident on April 28 occured in 6th period the incident on the 27th occured in 2nd period and the April 20 vandalism took place in 8th Period Judging by how spread out they are I have absolutely no way of knowing if these were done by the same person I can however ask some friends to check around tommorow that should yield something or another

Oh and one last thing On Tuesday and on Thursday I can get on Wikipedia sometime around 1120 to 1130 to check up on this If you havent posted an update sicne the night before at that time Ill be checking back up on the page about every five minutes or so until 1245ishAnd after that itll be at least until 300 something before I get home to check it again If there is any other information that you can provide let me know Port numbers would be great if you could get them It wouldnt be too hard for me to get a list of what ports go where at my school The admins are really really stupid
