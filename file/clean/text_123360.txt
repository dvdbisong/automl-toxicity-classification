I am afraid you misunderstand me  I did provide several references for my translations  They were other runes of the same time period  I view the translations as not being in error rather a continued intentional ethnic distortion of the people of that era  There are repeated assertions that they did not believe in God wore Horns on their heads had no language skills wrote meaningless things did not travel beyond there borders were only men and so on  So these are not personal opinions of other translations this is an outcry against discrimination  And it wasnt just the Hogganvik you deleted my changes from there were seven others
