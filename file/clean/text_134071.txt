By sympathetic view do you mean the view of those sympathetic to the FV or in other words those who believe something happened  If so I have to say that most of the LDS denominations that I know about teach that the Great Apostasy occurred and that JS Jr was called by God to restore His church  The Community of Christ has deemphasized the apostasy aspect of the FV so ended the Great Apostasy doesnt apply to them so most is probably correct The First_VisionCommunity_of_Christ section explains this I dont think it is a detail we need to cover in the lead but if someone wants to suggest different wording I say go for it but I think there are much bigger problems in the article than this
