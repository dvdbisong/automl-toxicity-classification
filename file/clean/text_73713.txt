Salvio Pls justify as to why I am being blockedI admit initially i was not aware of WP policy and hence made more than 3 reverts but now I have gone through them and have been doing things as per policy You yourself can go through the Yadav page and see that I have made changes as per consensus No one except Sitush seems to be having problem with itSitushs personal problem with Yadav is already raised as an issue with an administrator Where have i gone wrong  Looks like for wiki admins if they have to chose between a person with 50 edits and 5000 edits they will always support person with 5000 edits no matter what wrong he has been doing request you to lif this ban immediately or tell me what is the escalation process to do this
