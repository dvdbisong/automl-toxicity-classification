I believe that the article did say this or at least used to I have not checked recently however and it might very well have been removed or hacked up since this article seems to offend so many I do not think it is valuable for me to defend it since there are so many Hindus here and only one of me and I would very quickly be overwhelmed However in the interests of mutual understanding permit me to clarify a few things Creation or origin accounts are only important in one minor branch of Christianity I cannot speak for Islam And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianitynot as many as Hinduism perhaps but in the hundreds for sureall interpreted differently by different sects This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity And it is true that some branches of Christianity will charge others with blasphemy for not agreeing with them but again this is only true of a small segment The difficulty rests in the rather visible and vocal minority causing trouble I suspect similar things might be true of Islam as well
