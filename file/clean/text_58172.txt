Ruby 

Removed a factual error about Ruby and what was pure speculation to attempt to explain this error If anyone has actual evidence that her real name is Liza and Ruby is a nickname because of her clothes and makeup please provide it and revert my changes Her grandmother calling her Liza while saying she looks like a drag queen doesnt make it her real name any more than it makes her grandmothers real name Norman Bates when he dressed as Norman Batess mother
