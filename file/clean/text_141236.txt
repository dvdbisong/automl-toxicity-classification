The author of this article has his main focus clearly defined It is the socalled controversey around the site This leads me to believe that he was kicked off the site andor his stories deleted and he is using wikipedia to get back This free online encylopedia isnt a stage to enact vengence its to provide UNBIASED information on the subject True this subject points out that it has one million stories but it doesnt say anything positive and instead focuses on the negative If the creator cant be unbiased he should step aside and let worthy people write about this This would NOT be me as fanfictionnet is one of my favorite sites
