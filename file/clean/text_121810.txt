New Heading  Opposition to circumcision

The genital integrity movement relates to an individuals rights to choose for himself But this is only a recent phenomenon and there are many other reasons people have opposed circumcision in history which cannot be listed under this heading  So i thimk this is a broader topic heading which means that the opposition to circumcison to circumcision in days gone by can properly be outlined  The article at the moment is obviously still focused on the Genital Integrity movement so Ill add some more stuff in the future to reflect the more general topic opposition to circumcision while still including genital Integrity as a subheading
