Im okay with that Per WikipediaRedirectWhat needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects it should be mentioned in the lead and bolded There is also the WikipediaArticle titlesTreatment of alternative names policy for synonyms although not all synonyms are mentioned in the lead either because they are one of several or many and should rather be covered lower in the article or because they are offensive andor unencyclopedic while there is WikipediaNOTCENSORED and it is a policy it can be trumped by the WikipediaOffensive material guideline seeing as even WikipediaNOTCENSORED mentions that offensive material shouldnt be included just for the sake of including it Anyway yep there is no problem with your proposal for the engine coolant text 13425524788
