But your addition doesnt say any of that Your addition says
In the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon  a geology professor from Caltech met with Apollo 15 astronauts and helped to raise their interest in the history and origin of granite He pointed out that without a deep sense of observation the astronauts would just be as good as small robots sent to the moon to collect rock samples
All this says is some Caltech professor explained rocks and the importance of human observation to the astronauts It certainly doesnt put across the degree of emphasis you suggest here
