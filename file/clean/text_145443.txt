An automatic system that detects humidity is an improvement but there are also those other factors like turning into the sunlight or shadows  Leaving the fan on might well be an improvement too since there are times when AC plus fan feels too cold but turning both off feels too hot  Having just the fan on might be better at least for a few minutes
