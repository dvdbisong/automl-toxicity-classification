Its very much like the storyline of the Impossible PlanetSatan Pit episodes A craftplanet is falling into something that would destroy it at the will of a mysterious creature In IPSP its a Satanlike creature in 42 its a star I get the feeling that Chris Chibnall just ripped off the previously mentioned twopart story but just compressed it into a single episode Dont both stories take place in the 42nd centurymillennium
