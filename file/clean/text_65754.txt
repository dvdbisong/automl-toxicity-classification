In defense of my edit to add Transformers to the list of film examples I can think of no more authoritative source to state that a particular item is a MacGuffin than Roger Ebert  As someone else noted in the revert of my edit Roger Ebert does not rely on Wikipedia to make this determination  he relies on his professional judgement and merely directs those who dont know what a MacGuffin is to this page  Great press for Wikipedia  Ill admit that I thought it would be clever for those so directed to find the Allspark in Transformers specifically listed as a Macguffin but that does not detract from its timeliness and relevance as an example
