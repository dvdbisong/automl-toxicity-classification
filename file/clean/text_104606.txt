Deleting Future World Music Article 

Hi
Sorry to disturb
Its just Im not fimiliar with all the precedures of writnig an article

Now
I opened Future world music official website  and found some information about the movies they made songs for
So I just typed thier names in this article
Then I found some info about Future World Music in the same site  so yes I admit I copied it but it was a couple of sentences only
At last I havent finished the article yet and was planning to continue to inhance it and adding the references The official site

So please whats wrong
And how to avoid that again for this exact article
What should I do to make it accepted

Thanks And Sorry Again

Best Regards
