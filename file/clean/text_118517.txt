 Some good points which require more thought  Some initial responses 
 I dont think Ukraine in WWI is suitable because most of the activity discussed in the article wasnt directly concerned with the war and the period covered doesnt correspond to the duration of WWI 19141918 
 Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire would be better but it only defines the period in question by what it followed In contrast in the Russian Revolution is associated with the events covered herein
 I agree that History of Ukraine 19171922 is the most neutral but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly rather than always having to type a piped link History of Ukraine 19171922 Ukraine in the Russian Revolution

 The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution but that will take a bit of reading first

 Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title  Personally I think its neutral because it doesnt imply that Ukraine was Russian but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire

 But as I wrote above you make some good points  Id like to get some more input from other editors  Z 20061030 0334 Z
