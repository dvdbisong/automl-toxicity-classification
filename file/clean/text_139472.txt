Indeed and its about time you stopped attacking my edits as being biased I make BOLD edits to provide further content and without any discussion you choose to remove them Its also a WP policy to discuss with other editors your rationale BEFORE reverting edits You make no attempt to discuss the contributions of others except to quote policy that suits your desire to revert anything of which you even slightly disagree To suggest that your intent is less than constructive is not a personal attack its evidence based What information have you contributed to this article except being critical of other editors  nothing In fact thanks to your efforts much useful material has been removed 11017423139
