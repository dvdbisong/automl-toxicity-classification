Your recent claims
Dear delanoy I am really surprised to hear that I could be editing from someone elses account  This is simply impossible technically I am the only account for my edits Some editors may develop close online camaraderie on certain pages of their mutual interest but that is where the issue stops Your use of wikistalk is controversial I added my name next to names of users who opposed my edits and wikistalk found very close similarity
