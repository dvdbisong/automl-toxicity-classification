Userboxagain 

Hello Im sorry to bother you I was wondering if you could help me out again If you recall I replaced the contreversial userbox with this one This user supports resistance to hostilities as you suggested I removed the Israeli part that was contreversial A user thought I had the right to keep the Israel part and added it to the userbox 1 After a long talk with userViridae I offered to remove the Israeli part again because I did not want to discuss the issue any further He then refused to unprotect my userpage and told me to remove the link to massacres I ask for your help to remind him of what all of us previously discussed I made an act of good faith by offering to remove the Israeli part even though I have every right to keep it He just wants to provoke me as it obviously shows when he then tells me that Israeli wasnt  the contreversial one Hes just abusing his rights as an admin Hell end up telling me to remove the whole thing
