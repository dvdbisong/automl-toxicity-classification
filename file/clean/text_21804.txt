MWN listed as TV 

Multiple users continue to delete MWN Mountain West Network in the TV section There is absolutely no reason why this cant be listed as TV ESPN3 is only online yet it has been widely accepted as being listed as TV Same with BTN digital OVC network ASuntv and other various conference streams For conference games the MWN actually has an announcing crew and their own on air graphics unlike non conference games which was just the stream the stadium uses on their video screens There is absolutely no reason why it should not be listed in TV The people that have kept removing it have given no reason for their edit I have given a reason for my edit every time I will continue to revert the edits if they continue
