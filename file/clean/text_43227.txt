I dont understand this What is going on Arthur Rubin just blocked me I mean is this process autocratic Like anyone can block any time with random allegations I couldnt help getting deeply insulted by this kind of behaviour Some one on another page called me shitstirring troll or MORON and told me to Fuck off because I was asking questions Now Im the bad guy WHAT IS THIS It all started yesterday when I edited a page Criticism of Islam Please do check its history I concede my previous edit might have not been up to wikipedia standards but the administrator drmies when I asked him why he reverted the changes threatened to block me told me be prepared to be blockedNow I know he was not the only one to feel that way I ignored his threat as I was sanguine I was not being impolite or uncivil in any way So subsequently I edited it for the last time and I truly kept it neutrally Informative added Information which was not previously there on the page But somebody reverted the changes again Then I wanted to know more as to where was I going wrong They told me that my sources are not reliable and other sources are simply reliable because they say so Believe me that pretty much sums up their justification for reverting all of my changesI am not a liar I loathe sanctimonious BigotsThe truth is criticism of islam article has so terribly untrue statements for sanitizing muhammads misconducts and odious commands of Quran It is less of a criticism of Islam and more of an apologetic exposition a deadly attempt to justify many obscene misconduct of Muhammad not to mention it is also fraught with atrocious lies with unreliable references It is a grievous assault on history itself No offense but I think they dont know Islam very well Talk if you want
