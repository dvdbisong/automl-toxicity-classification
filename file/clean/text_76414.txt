AFD for Vedontakal Vrop 

Im a bit confused by this closure While on a purely votecounting stance there appears to be no consensus the arguments advanced by the deletion side are so clearly superior that it seems impossible to conclude that the article should remain in place How much less notable does a subject have to be to get deleted than the existence of no sources beyond a single student paper from India
