Quality issues
The article definitely deserves it Bclass status It is poorly organized and the quality of English at some places is poor
Where are the Telugu scholars and PhDs Maybe someone should ask professors from Government universities to contribute to wikipedia  they do have a lot of time on their hands Unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge in this area to edit what has been written 
I have removed some rather poorly written sections which contained redundant information on Telugu for examplethere is a page for the language and related issues
