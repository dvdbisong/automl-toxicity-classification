Ahso youre an administrator maybe Pardon me then  you were apparently only trying to do your job 

I was thrown off by the fact that you voted nonneutrally and without verification for your editorial remarks Surely an administrator doesnt want to be caught violating Wikipedia policy I guess Im a bit confused 

But may I ask you a question Have you cited anyone else for incivility A simple yes or no would do  Im not interested in whom else you cited Id just like to ascertain that youre being balanced in your assessments thats all Youve got a very bad show going on here a regular grabastic kangaroo court and in no way am I the cause of it

But I think you probably knew that already didnt you 

Anyway thanks in advance for your forthcoming assurance of administrative symmetry or maybe not
