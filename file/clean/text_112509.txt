Holy Redeemer Catholic parish Belize City  

You ask what this article is about Admittedly it covers a long and varied history but Im not sure what I should do to make clearer what is being discussed A parish is a group of people united as church in a particular locale In the first line of the article I state that the article will tell about the history of this people over time I divide the article into early history Foundations and Twentieth Century  I explain that in a country with a remarkable history but very few historians an order of Catholic priests Jesuits are one of the few extant chroniclers of this history I believe the history is worth preserving and welcome your suggestions on how the article might be made more userfriendlyjzsj
