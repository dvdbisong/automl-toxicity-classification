The origin of the Pearl of Great Price 

I recently added a paragraph on the origin of the Pearl of Great Price  The paragraph was reverted  Before we get into a reversion war I would like to know what the problem is with my paragraph  Im happy to put it wherever deemed appropriate  But the origin should be noted correct  Also the fact that it was according to scholars mistranslated should also be noted correct  I think these facts are important to the article
