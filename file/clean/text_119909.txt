ReAre You Mad

No I am not angry at you Actually I really appreciate your kindness patience and tolerance I was just very busy and overlooked responding to you What I am dissapointed in is some other users who seem to be more interested in policing my contributions instead of doing their own contribution They waste about 12 of my time at Wikipedia with their personal remarks and offtopic arguments and their constant reverting of my attributed contributions Otherwise I am doing well I hope you are also doing well AlohaÂ  AI 

Great glad to hear it     talk
