Civil  YOU were the one who accused ME of vandalism The story has been reported by just about every reputable news agency My edit may not have proper citation but it was NOT vandalism You are the one who leveled a false accusation and claimed the edit was nonconstructive Maybe you should look at your own faults before seeing imaginary ones in others If you accuse me of vandalism one more time you will be reported Have a nice day
