FreemasonrywatchORG is quite clearly NOT a commercial content provider but a personal webpageblog therefore your justification is completely bogus In fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator in addition to the previous complaint I made against you about your anticatholic hate filled username 

 The Epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of
 hisuserame Mason Boyne Presbyterian bigot and Orange
 Lodgemember says to his wife Did you know Morag that
 if you spell Pope backwards you get Epop which is a
 fourletter word beginning with E like Evil You see
 its all there in the Bible if you just shoogle the letters
 around a bit

The fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between prooccult and antioccult editors shows your complete disregard for Wikipedia guidelines and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made had the effect at least for a time if not permanently to check the farther spread of that association The legislative power of some of the States was invoked and at last actually interposed to prevent the administration of extrajudicial oaths including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system From the moment of the adoption of a penal law deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside At this day the subject has ceased to be talked of The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things until at last it may be said that few persons are aware of the fact provided it be not especially forced upon their notice that not only Freemasonry continues to exist but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature if not of its unjustifiable obligations not merely live but greatly flourish in the midst of them 

Fully aware of this state of things a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations Without cherishing the remotest desire even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation of reviving an old excitement they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemasons Oath Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination This great deficiency it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to a desirable object to supply They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume not as a matter of sale but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution And first of all they deemed
