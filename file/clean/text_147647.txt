Hear hear Sebastian This entire discussion is absolutely ridiculous All that is being desired is to mention that this rifle has been used a lot in mass shootings Period There is no bias built into this and since it has had a track record of such use more than any other gun that fact ought to be noted in the article for people to know It is not taking any sides on the issue one way or the other Those who are opposed to the inclusion of this fact are basically squelching the free speech of others Its absolutely pathetic the excuses and arguments they have used Include a nonbiased statement about the use of this weapon among mass murderers and be done with it already Enough argument  talk
