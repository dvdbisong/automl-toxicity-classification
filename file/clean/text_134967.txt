this user has been stalking me and reverting all my comparatively larger edits without providing enough reason One example just because one of my sentences contained one slightest but Im not too sure if it was incorrect at all scientific inaccuracy he rashly reverted the whole edit when he could have enriched the article by simply correcting the inaccuracy with good sources

I sincerely think he is trying to start multiple edit wars at once He thinks just because I dont have many administrator friends he could revert my changes His primary claim is that none of my sources are reliable but hisher sources are Just look at his contributions His contributions are mostly deletions of the edits he doesnt like Also his activity is mysteriously sporadic He might as well be a sock he also claims that whoever supports my position is my sockpuppet Im really discouraged by this sort of behaviour Cant you do anything to help me  Talk
