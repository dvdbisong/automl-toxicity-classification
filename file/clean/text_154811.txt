You have always been a model for good conduct in my recollection My capacity involved a more inyourface attitude to other editors who were not aware of the inner workings and prior histories I was relieved when Wales removed Mccoys bio as that was always Mccoys wishes my experience with McCoy is that he always had multiconflicting interests due to his PTSD The inability to get others who were concerned with their own contributions and not McCoys wishes got me banned  several times LOL All Im asking is that you verify that Wales removed McCoys bio in the recent past and that should help to eliminate the expansion of McCoys bio from eating up the Whitman article Barring egos and information right activists My apologies for any past infringments Thanks 989416397
