Ah you misunderstood the that sentence is original research bitit was about the original sentence in the article not your sentence which indeed sounded more reasonable to me  
However just because a word or usage originated in England or in Britain doesnt mean its used the same way across the Englishspeaking Commonwealth  For example the colloquialisms bloody and mate acquired distinctive connotations in Australia as opposed to their usage in England as early as the late 19th century  US English is not a completely different animalat least not with respect to Canadian Englishand to the extent that it constantly influences pretty much all the other varieties of English  As for eh Id rather go with the literature than with your remarks which truly qualify as original research in comparison Jack
