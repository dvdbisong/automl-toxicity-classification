You want to fix this encyclopedia I posted some of the requirements on Wikipedia Review many months ago 
For reference I will repost and expand them here

1 Jimbo Wales has to leave He should turn over the server admin passwords to a professional 
responsible IT person who is salaried by the WMF
 
2 Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP 
Changes would include but not be limited to

   a BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected or better yet removed entirely

   b A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki No more IPaddress editing Anyone seeking
      to write for WP must apply and be approved NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 Assume good faith my ass

   c ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT by the editors whose work they oversee

3 Most critical to the projects success certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
banned from WP PERMANENTLY This would include but not be limited to
