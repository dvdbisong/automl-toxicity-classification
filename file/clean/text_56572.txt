outline articles 

I read your posts about outlines on AnnaFrances talk page and decided to call the military history project for help in establishing guidance and providing review processes where editors can get outside opinion The thread can be found here Greetings   

Historical outlines
Regarding CategoryHistorical outlines

I still strongly believe those Historical outline of foo articles should actually be named Timeline of foo More accurate and precise and perhaps comprehensible I mentioned it before somewhere but cant find it now

For an example compare Outline of Illinois history with Timeline of Chicago history

Maybe we need to upgrade List of timelines to be a part of the PortalContents set

Just a note for you to consider whilst youre massmoving things around     

 Based on the way the history section of outlines have been developed especially the history sections of country outlines the major classification scheme seems to be

 By period
 By region
 By subject

 Which makes these articles general outlines rather than timelines  The By period section may be a timeline if it is formatted that way

 As far as I can tell the historical outline of articles by Buaidh arent chronological but topical which makes them generic outlines rather than outlines of the timeline variety
