why dont we try and add more substance to some sections and add maybe one of those metallica and nirvana are music relative  zines and moshing are fan relative  Hardcore Punk is about Music Essentially without music there would be nothing to mosh to nor anything to write about  I would never want to delete people who helped define genres by influencing other influencers  Such as metallica  The page is about Hardcore Punk and its sub genres Not too much about gloves clothes chewing gum watches moshing sneakers  that stuff has its own page and pages and really doesnt define the Sound of which is Hardcore Punk  Whats your take on it  683915245
