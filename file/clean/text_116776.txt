Sustainabilty
Your edit is a bit off topic regarding a school that in reality moved from Cornell to Syracuse in the 1903 to 1911 time frame  Cornell lost that political battle and your recent addition regarding a donation to Cornells endowed side is not relevant to that statesupported school Please calm down The donation does not have to be posted on every Wikipedia article or mulitple times on the same wikipedia article Thanks
