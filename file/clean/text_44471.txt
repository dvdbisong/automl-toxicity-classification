Melchoir UltraSpace Field Theory 

Hi Sam

My name is Keith D Foote Im the author of a treatise titled the UltraSpace Field Theory Every once in a while I google the USF theory to see if its found a home on any new websites I came across a message from someone warning a Wikipedian writer to stop pushing the UltraSpace Field Theory and that all future references would be sent to Melchoir 

The UltraSpace Field theory is an alternative model to the current particle theory paradigm and is generally ignored by the scientific community so Im not surprised your organization wants nothing to do with it My own brother with a Bachelors in Science called it whacked though he could find no fault with its conclusions From what I can tell it is a historical truth that scientists being the busy people they are detest new science models Many of the assumptions in physics we currently hold as truth took decades to overcome locked mindsets For example a huge number of physicists describe magnetic fields as an illusion though there is no evidence supporting this conclusion and the Earths magnetic field protects us from billions of electrons being ejected by the Sun every minute 

I would like to request Melchoir be given an opportunity to read the treatise If Melchoir will email me a snail mail address I would be happy to send him a copy

I can be reached at patienthunternetscapenet

Thanks

Sincerely

Keith D Foote
