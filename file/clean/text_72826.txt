Without looking at anything else Football Domination is not an appropriate section title IMO   
Also without looking at anything else agree that Football Domination is not appropriate Ive also again grouped these threads   

As for RealCowboys who have an history of being blocked and not behaving should not delete information and lable it as false when the subject has been discussed and proven correct or delete information on a rival football clubs Wikipedia page without any discussion before deleting it as he is biased In what way was me deleting Football Domination biased The section title it self is biased Any other succesful team could claim its self as Football Domination why I disagree with you is because your trying to justify that FC Barcelona is an unstopable team did you know they lost againts Getafe A lower rank team or they couldnt defeat Espanol Another lower rank team I would imagine that if they did dominate they would be on top when in fact as of right now they and currently in second Im going to tell you one more time DO NOT refer or mention me in any of your juvenile post If you have a problem use the talk page without using another editors name
