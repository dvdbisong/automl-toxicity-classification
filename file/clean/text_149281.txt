Hy 
I am a 29years old artist and I work with different media from light to images and videos
Sometimes I work in digital with photoshop over some picture I made with my camera and sometimes I use other pictures like scans from newspapers ec
What I do is add colors to the images merge other images in one ecc
Finally the work is different from the starting image and have my personal cut
I found your images on Wikimedia and I think that the panoramas are really beautiful and perfectly made
Is possible to take some part of your pictures and work over it What I need to do
I ask this because sometimes I sell my works so I dont want to go over the author of the image
pleas let me know 
and congratulation again for you beuatiful pictures
