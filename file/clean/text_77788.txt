I agree that Steviethemans suggestion is the most appropriate to implement JHP if youre talking about the 1454 27 June 2007 2420930113 edit 141014976 entry that I reverted it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either a including the references themselves or b not following the WPBLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident  If youre talking about the 2232 2 July 2007 Realkyhick edit 142152748 entry that I reverted its because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time  If youre talking about your edit 147620955 from the 29th that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page poorly included and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident including it in the intro section isnt really appropriate either especially as it in essence duplicated information that was posted further down the page  Yes I know that youll disagree with the in essence part but go with me on the concept  As for an official WP policy there are guidelines listed in the help section on what makes a good article I like to think that the Incidents articles fall under WPBETTERArticles_covering_subtopics
