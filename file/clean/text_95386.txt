The first line may be incorrect Aliens may view this article 

Where it says on the first line Earth the planet on which we live that may be incorrect if aliens from another planet grasp satelite signals from our planet In that case we may offend them and they could sue Wikipedia for irrelevant information I therefore feel we should change it to Earth the planet on which humans live Its important that our information be as relevant as possible and that is why we should change the first line
