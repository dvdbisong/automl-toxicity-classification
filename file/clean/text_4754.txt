Merger proposal 
I propose that List of Deans of ILR School be merged into Cornell University ILR School I think that the list could easily be just a table in the history section of this article and theschool article is of a reasonable size in which the merging of list of deans will not cause any problems as far as article size or undue weight is concerned
