Back in the daybefore Zlykinskyja got herself banned with her pilgrimrose signonwhen the trial was still in progress is was reasonable to balance the arguments for Knoxs guilt and innocence   
 Now that shes been found guilty it seems ridiculous to keep bringing up the arguments for her innocence that were soundly rejected by the trial court   
 How many times does it need to be said that Knoxs Mommy and Daddy dont think shes guilty   
 How the murder occured is clearly laid out in the judges narrative and that is what should be lifted into this article to explain this crime   
 Every piece of evidence does not need a notation attached to it that Knox disagrees Everyone gets that Knox claims shes innocent   
 Zlykinskyja needs to get the the court rejected Knoxs claim of innocence   
 Knox has been in prison for what will soon be 3 years for this crime Every judge at every level on every issue has rules against Knox on this case There is no miracle that awaits Knox Shes in prison for the crime and there she will stay   
    
 Youre wasting your time with Zlykinskyja She will settle for nothing less than her way 10 years from now she will her declaring Knoxs innocence She has no interest in compromise on this As she has clearly shown by continuing to edit the article She has an agenda and it doesnt involve being reasonable
