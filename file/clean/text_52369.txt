parentage

According to user Rob the criterium for proving parentage is that both Sharlto and his father MUST be mentioned on the SAME PAGE in an independent source  On closer inspection however it is revealed that this is an arbitrary madeup requirement Even so if you look at the reference httpwwwclubclaimscozachtml you will notice that the names of the entire Copley family is grouped together on one page and in one section To break it up in little pieces If you are somebodys brother and your brother has a father and all your surnames are the same then your brothers dad must also be your dad unless your mother has remarried to somebody else with exactly that same surname  extremely unlikely  Put this together with the mention of the Copley family as claimants in an independent source put this together with numerous interviews with the father where he mentions who his sons are if in any further doubt use the mothers contact details supplied by an independent source for verification  Note that this is not original research but is simply a verifiable source  The result is that there can be no real doubt beyond purely academic grounds about Sharltos
