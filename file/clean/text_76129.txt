Please Some more time
After a brief hiatus Ive found 15 image FUR requests on my page for Feb 1314 alone You can see from the notices above these that Ive been diligent in trying to apply fairuse rationales where I can In a couple of cases even pulling back and going along with an imagedeletion that in retrospect did seem proper and necessary But 15 in two days is an awful lot to ask I think the policy is down to two days after a notice goes up and I would just ask for a few more say a week to address them all one way or another Thanks for understanding
