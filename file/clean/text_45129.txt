Youre right I did act like a loser I felt bad about it and I apologized for it I just came to voice my opinion because I too have noticed that a certain group of editors have been networking their GA nominated articles amongst themselves I am also aware of some of the subpar reviewing practices being conducted by a few of the accused so I have provided examples as proof of what Im talking about For a reviewer to not give the nominator a chance to address concerns brought forth in their review is both wrong and not fair To review a GAN article it would benefit an editor to have a good understanding of what theyre reviewing for before they start Ive seen some very questionable articles being accepted as GA by a few of the editors included in this group thats all  meow
