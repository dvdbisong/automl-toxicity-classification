Be nice 

Thanks for your improvement to Roger Clemens Its a good idea though to try to be calm and civil in your edit summaries Saying Are you serious Learn up stats rather than throwing in random numbers seems to go against WikipediaAssume good faith

Whoever made that mistake might feel insulted

Its possible for instance that those were his 2005 stats and the person accidentally typed 2006 instead of 2005 Or 2007 or any recent year like that
