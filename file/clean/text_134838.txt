WPAGF only goes so far especially when there is the appearance of an agenda supporting ones opinion is one thing mentioning the victim most every time is another As to the content of the SeaWorld article itself it needs work  no question Clean out the marketing spin and focus on SeaWorlds history prior to its acquisition by AnheuserBusch at which point it became part of Busch Entertainment Corporation which is now SeaWorld Parks  Entertainment As to favorable vs unfavorable if thats truly how I felt such incidents articles wouldnt exist Ive gone through with SpikeJones and other editors to keep everything consistent first getting involved with them after the monorail accident in July 2009 when this exact same issue came up and again consensus was that leaving out the victims name didnt damage the article nor did it add any significant value to it at which point tie goes to leave it out After that it was the rash of lewdbehavior incidents at Central Florida water parks  again if I was trying to protect the parks I wouldnt have allowed the information in as if it were completely up to me anyway Heck I added a number of them into their respective articles and I fleshed out others with more details and more source information to back it all up In the interest of full disclosure the victims in those incidents were generally minors which a wouldnt have been named by the news and b if some unscrupulous person had gotten a hold of the names I have no doubt the names would be expunged immediately and nobody who really had the projects best interests at heart would put up a fight In not so many words while also incidents they did have special conditions that dont make them good examples in this dispute

These incidents articles are based purely on whats in the local newspapers with no candycoating no PR spin  save one thing which has been followed with almost all the incidentaccident articles Ive reviewed both themepark and nonthemepark Unless they were already notable victims names arent included because they arent necessary to as you put it tell the story There are of course exceptions such as the victims of the Titanic but the theme park incident articles are consistent

Lastly as to your assertion of WPCOI Id welcome any proof youd care to provide in regards to edits being made currently Previous COI edits such as those that inspired the newspaper article you cited should indeed be expunged and replaced by neutral point of view information But thats an issue for another day
