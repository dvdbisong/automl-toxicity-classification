I have read this and about the only thing I can pick up on that you may not like is unveirifable information  which I content under the rule Photos are neutral Another reason perhaps wanting to limit amount of links on page  however 2 links is not excessive surely Perhaps the most likely reason is that I posted the link myself for a website I own Can it be verified who posted the link for derilictecouk then The users have blocked their details from inspection with Nominet so it could well be posted by a user who edits the RAF Rudloe Manor pages If we discover who runs this site and they are on the Rudloe Manor page should this be deleted also

Thank you Rklawton User Verbal chose on another page crop circles to delete my link to my website there also However Verbal did not bother to check the other links some of which link to conetnt which requires plugin software to be installed This is discouraged by Wiki policy external links but for some reason Verbal chose to only take a keen interest in removing my link and not bothering checking anything else or doing any other work I find this odd and Verbal has followed me on to this page to decry my links The words Witch Hunt come to mind Can you please explain what reasons you feel apply to why the links need to be removed If it would make you happier I could easily provide another wesbite which is not owned by myself but uses my aerial photos of Rudloe Manor AFter all derlicte does not have such aerial photography and only covers Site1 of the base Pointing to the policy page does not address the many points I have made re some users being able to post personal photos directly to Wiki but myself not even being allowed to make a link to photos If I were to upload my photos of Rudloe Manor directly to Wiki how many miliseconds would it take before editors removed them just because its me 

I draw your attention to   a gallery of pictures some of which are even classified unidentified bird pictures and this is seen as perectly fine I feel obligated to do this considering my own issues being looked into I consider this type of gallery to be exactly the type of thing I would not be allowed to do These sorts of galleries should be on a users own flicker pages or personal website and not to use Wiki space for personal advertising or gratification  which is directly what I seem to be being told I cannot do
