Im not asking for an apology for your deletions of my honest good faith truthful efforts to contribute to Wikipedia at Mormon blogosphere Ill just chalk this up to you being a little overbearing and unintentionally a bully  Please stop referring me to another article without answering my honest question  Refusing to provide a simple explanation is harmful to relationships between two honest people and doesnt help anyone involved with a disagreement on WP Please keep in mind that I am a person with feelings too and being gangtackled for a good faith effort on my part causes hurt feelings on the my end as well  I hope this provides a more clear explanation why a person may lash out when he feels gangtackled by Wikipedia editors without a quick clear concise explanation should you do this to someone else in the future  Once again Ill chalk this up to poor communications rather than any malice on your part    
Really After you said Why should I listen to you anyway it was pretty clear you didnt want me to answer you so others stepped in now youre blaming me for your behavior and the other people responses and calling me a bully All anyone here and your talk page was trying to do was help you Please dont expect any other communication from me at this time and stay off of User talk208811844 as Im going to completely wpDISENGAGE from you  208811844
