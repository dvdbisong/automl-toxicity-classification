Removal of Peg Entwistle

While I am aware that Original Research is frowned upon here in Wiki World I do know that inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims are even more so Having said that before anyone deletes my deletion please know that as Peg Entwistles biographer I have been scrutinizing every claim made regarding her I have also interviewed her family including her brother Milton Entwistle Peg had a room at the familys Beachwood Canyon Drive house and stayed there whenever she was in town Although Milton is over 90 he is sharp as a tack and remembers as yesterday his sister living in the house and NOT at the Hollywood Studio Club Apartments

Also my search into the records receipts and rental agreements of HSC did not find a single item mentiong Peg Entwistle
