Ok I added a paragraph about Native Americans and the national park Chief Josephs band crossing the park is perhaps the key event but also notable is that the Sheepeater Shoshones had been permanent residents of what became the park until leaving per a treaty unratified and that after the Nez Perce crossing of the park and a Bannock band entering the park in 1878 and the Sheepeater Indian War park superintendent Norris had a fort built to make sure Indians would be prevented from entering the park the Sheepeater War did not occur in the park but influenced Norriss decision Im not sure where this fort was built These three bits of history seem important enough to include in the parks History section Unfortunately due to the years when these things took place the 1870s and 1880s chronologically they fit into the subsection called Park creationand seem somewhat out of place among all the info about the early superintendents rangers and so on Im not sure if this is problematic or not Seems acceptable
