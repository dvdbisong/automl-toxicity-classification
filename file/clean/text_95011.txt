None of these releases are listed on the discography of Stings offical site due to the fact that these are not released by AM Records it only includes Stings releases by AM which otherwise is quite complete
I personally have the CDsingles for My Funny Friend and Me and Invisble Sun and have bought them as new in record stores in Scandinvaia which proves that they were released in more than just one or two European countries

I added these four releases with what is considered quite reliable sourcesreferences to the discography because they rightly belong there so dont remove these proper single releases just because you might have not seen them or because they were not released in UK

Btw I removed the credit for Twista from Stolen Car Take Me Dancing as only the remixes feature TWista not the radio versionsingle version or album version I think you can agree on that one
