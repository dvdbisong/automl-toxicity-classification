is known as the alBuraq wall to Muslims I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims However from everything that Ive read the name is of rather recent provenance and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel If memory serves it didnt really have any circulation until the last two decades or so  from the obscure claims of Mujir alDin that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise which itself is a legend derived from Sahih alBukhari the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor thats of little relevance here though I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing and I dont advocate any necessity of removing it However the attribution itself is sixteenth century and actual naming of it as the alBuraq wall is incredibly recent I think we should at the very least clarify this add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this I just skimmed it but Im not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title nevermind it does For all I know it may itself be the origin of the name with this article helping to disseminate it Since this like every Jerusalemrelated article is contentious I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything   

Yes its a point of contention See above it is discussed both in the Lead subsection of the POV Issues section and in the Rashid Khalidi section  

Jordanian occupation 19481967
I was wondering from whom did the Jordanian capture the old city of AlQuds and the wall and why was the Jordanian rule over it considered occupation while Israeli rule is considered sovereignty I dont find this neutral This should be changed   
The answer is in the article  
It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised hence occupation And while Israels presence is also not recognised the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised in reality Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site As this matter is disputed I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site but I could not find any good sources   
Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if Im not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank Which is under occupation  Preceding unsigned comment added by 9019316207   
Jerusalem is viewed differently from the West Bank See Positions on Jerusalem and Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan This subject matter is so extensive and there are so many diverse postions on the subject I am not really qualified to determine the correct descriptions But for the sake of neutrality I believe Yamanam does have a valid point Even though the artricle on Jordans rule calls it occupation I suggest changing both to rule which would hopefuly solve the problem   
Yes i belive that could be an acceptable compromise i would prefer it if you did it as edits by account members are more respectable  Preceding unsigned comment added by 9019316207   
I will But why not become an editor yourself It only takes a second

Im not sure but maybe the article could report about the famous incident that
