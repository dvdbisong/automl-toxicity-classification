Dude dont tell me what I am finding and not finding in the dictionary when what you are saying is contradicted by the direct and immediate evidence of my own eyes  Root س و د from which words meaning black in the sense of an abstract color are derived is defined on page 513 of the dictionary while root ز ن ج whose historicallychanging range of meanings I have adequately explained in past comments on this talk page above is defined on pages 445446 of the book  These entries are over 50 pages apart in the dictionary

Im perfectly happy to add a formal reference to the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic in this article but the process is not facilitated by you telling me things which I know are factually false

And I was the one who told you several times above the information about the threefold distinction of the early Arabs between nubah النوبة ħabaš الحبش and zanj زنج  Usually the inhabitants of nubah and ħabašwere not called Zanjis by Arabs though occasionally they were but when other areas of Africa beyond the northeast Nile and coastal areas later came into the gographical horizon of the Arabs the inhabitants of those areas were often called Zanjis or Zunūj
