Ordu Vandalism 

 Please stop If you continue to vandalise Wikipedia you will be blocked  

You are using a biased and POV sources  they admit to it themselvesWikipediaNeutral_point_of_view you yourself are biased and POV per your Political claims on your personal page your source is uncorroborated not a valid source you continually edited without discussion or made nonsensical comments after the vandalism this claim does not belong on a city page that is not related to the subject matter and others have agreed to that fact you did it for the purposes of advertising the Armenian Political agenda that you clearly admit adhering to on your personal WP pagesoapbox and your source itself does not again it DOES NOT  say anything about specifially genocide in Ordu  which is without a doubt pure Vandalism as you are twisting the source that you supplied yourself You even misquoted from the original This not even sneaky vandalism  its blatant purposeful organized and relentless

To reitirate my point on Ordutalk your sources are not NPOV WikipediaNeutral_point_of_view I never argued with you about their Academic credentials even though the specific claims made by them are uncorroborated by any other Academic dead or alive Dardian the originator of your claim himself has not ever explicity said there was genocide in Ordu You are interpreting  which is your POV on top of his POV Dardian is now the director of a Armenian Genocide Research organization You can not honestly expect anyone to believe you that are they are NOPV sources and that you are doing this to improve that quality of WP Regardles of all of these I mentioned on Ordutalk you have blatantly ignored my warnings
