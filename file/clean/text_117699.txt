Well Im having trouble taking any of you guys seriously except for Fadix Hes one of the few people here that have been trying to make this article even remotely fair And yet you have to bitch at him because you want this article so full of caveats maybes and no one is sure about this statements that it has 0 credability I call that pathetic Just because people like you have successfully ensured that people who push this view can be punished in Turkey doesnt mean that you can hold wikipedia hostage either
Fadix is right This page gives special treatment to Turkey unlike similar pages on massacres genocide etc It doesnt deserve a single bit more
Blue there is nothing wrong with having an academic position If you object to that then I guess its because you want to lend credance to the Turkish governments position as you feel it desperately needs it Well tough luck because ordering academic and nonacademic views make much more sense
