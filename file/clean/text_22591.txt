Content deletion at Anton Kreil 

I see you removed content at Anton Kreil without leaving an edit summary to explain why you deleted the text Im happy to assume good faith about your edit but please understand that even wellknown named editors here normally leave edit summaries especially where they are deleting existing content Since you are editing from an IP address that has been associated with recent vandalism if you dont want to create a named account here it helps if you can be extra careful to attach edit summaries to all your changes When content is deleted without an edit summary by an anonymous editor from an address with a history of vandalism other contributors have no reason to assume good faith If they are in a hurry theyll just revert your changes
