sourcing question 

Ive been contacted by the unit historian for 4th Supply Battalion who has given me some information and an image to use for that article However its not published anywhere but in the units records which are not generally accessable to anyone not at the units headquarters How would I be able to source this information in order to use it in the article Would I be able to forward the email to OTRS and cite the ticket as a source Or perhaps simply just cite unit historian It would be a shame to be unable to use this history Thanks in advance wordsdeeds
