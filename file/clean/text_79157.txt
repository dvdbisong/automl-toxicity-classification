Thanks for the response but IMHO it doesnt go to what is the problem with the statement  The statement in the article presents it as a fact that Tesla was on the verge of destroying his own building with his resonance device until he stopped it with a sledge hammer  That is almost certainly false  People repeating Teslas claims that this occurred is not providing a source that the claim is true  And given that the claim was specifically examined on Mythbusters and it was shown to be improbable and that there is a lack of any test data that suggested it was remotely possible and the fact that just based on common sense understanding of the nature of damping and resonances it seems improbable stating it as fact in this Wikipedia article is incorrect I believe

Another issue is that even if it were true it doesnt seem like it belongs in a section titled American Citizenship
