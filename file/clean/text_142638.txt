Our procedures and processes are not infallible and are susceptible to misuse too sometimes I have seen one of my friends charged and indefinitely blocked after hardly 10 or 12 innocent and normal edits as that administrator suspected that user to be a sockpuppet of a particular user already blocked I learnt that some administrators are astrologers too I have repeatedly told this incidence several times and this proved to me a point our system is subjective in many cases rather most of the cases Had that user been not so blocked heshe would have proved at least ten times more productive than users like me Having experienced this and having said this I should surely feel an attachment to wikipedia to be fooling around Perhaps there are many amongst us who do not want wikipedia to emerge as the best encyclopedia as its emergence would threaten many established encyclopedias Naturally such elements amongst us shall always try to drive away the good and reliable editors at least they shall try to annoy them to reduce their productivity However this should not be a cause for despondency and disappointment as I had found that good editors would survive in the long run At the same time you should also understand that the Indian nation has remained a subjugated nation for more than 1000 years and any resurgence of Indian national pride attracts attention mostly adverse and people may try to defame this national pride by connoting various names to it like Hindu fundamentalism Hindutva and so on Some had even gone to the extent  of comparing this resurgence with National Socialism to gain confidence of certain social groups In case I feel like giving any input in the said WPRFAr I would surely do  however I am not sure of myself to be useful in such serious affairs of wikipedia as I am a simple editor to take part in serious business of wikipedia I thank you for your message Regards
