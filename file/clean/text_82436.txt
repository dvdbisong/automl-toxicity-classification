Genre New Depth 

hi 

so I got your point but otherwise I dont know what to do new depth is a music genre any kind of music genre is on Wikipedia so why not new depth if I post something in a forum and tell everyone of new depth and mark it as a quote in wiki will it be enough 

im really sorry for asking again I just dont get why there must be a proof that this exists there are a lot of genres just known by a some people but enough for having an article on wiki

please tell me what to do to get new depth in wiki and is it completely deleted cause it took me a hour to translate everything can I find the deleted version somewhere

thanks paul
