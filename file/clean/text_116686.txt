Lead section 

I believe that the following sentence

When current is applied to the capacitor electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite polarity build up on each plate

is more accurate than this version

When charge is made to flow into the capacitor electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite polarity build up on each plate

You said in your edit summary that charge flows current is a flow implying that current doesnt flow verb  You are correct so its a good thing the original version didnt claim that current flows

Also the phrase charge is made to flow into the capacitor isnt really accurate as overall charge neither leaves nor enters the capacitor
