Favonian  thanks for the steer about links etc 
Clearly Wiki is the entity the community have made it and although the views and actions expressed dont seem consistent with many of the sentiments on the founders page such as objectivism etc that is the Wiki we have There is no prospect other than repetition of this issue as new invigilators come and go
I cant see the merit of taking the stance expressed with an individual contributor such as myself The website domain you may consider blacklisting is the one used by Wiki by association to validate copyright ownership of the materials I provide
The issue with all those images is that everyone of them contravenes a strict interpretation of the selfinterest policy as the licence for use requires attribution including my domain
For this reason they must all be removed from wiki Furthermore as the copyright holder Im withdrawing permission for their use and display by Wiki and request their deletion Im assuming you have a bot or similar that can do so efficiently
These materials are a drop in the wiki ocean and will not have any impact on the community
Thank you
