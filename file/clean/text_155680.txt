I told you in my first response that the problem is the attitude of the other user We are past the curling box issue The issue is the other user acting as if they are the supreme lord of wikicurling creating rules and guidelines that have not been discussed with other group members and then enforcing them upon everyone else You just said what Ive been trying to get across this whole time We are all volunteers here so nobody can be compelled to do anything they dont want to do  If the other user would change their attitude there wouldnt be an issue There was never a problem with things until this last year when the user created guidelines and then started enforcing them Ive been a member of the group for a few years and not once was I ever messaged to review these guidelines or participate in creating and developing them The other user solely created them and started enforcing them Its not fair that I am at risk of being sanctioned because the other user thinks they are in charge and can do whatever they want I have never had problems with any other user on this website and now it seems like Im being targeted because the other user wants to get their own way
