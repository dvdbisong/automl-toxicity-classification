Requested move 

UserTrevor coelhoThinkPad T Series Laptops  ThinkPad T Series Laptops  This is a new page I created it since the different series of ThinkPad laptops arent really represented on Wikipedia Im a new user and have created the page as closely in keeping with Wikipedias guidelines as possible  Id appreciate any feedback and input in case Ive made any errors this is my first attempt at creating a Wikipedia page Im planning on slowly introducing pages for all major products from Lenovo  like the different product series and the various product lines ThinkCentre ThinkStation IdeaCentre and so on  which arent represented on Wikipedia at all

Since this page hasnt been reviewed except by me I didnt want to put an uncontroversial move request Accordingly Im requesting a move this way which I hope will allow the page to be checked and then moved to live Wikipedia
