Michael Guillen reported for ABC News that the US Government had issued a patent to Patterson on his system for electrolysis And then Bart Simon quoted Guillen on that point Furthermore the government knew it was issuing a cold fusion patent The patent includes a reference to the work of Pons and Fleischmann and it claims excess heat The patent is itself a milestone in human history Failing to include mention of the patent in this article would be just silly
