I didnt ask you to declare a consensus did I You dont need to care about the issue but if you decide to determine the level of consensus in a discussion on the issue then you need to care enough to take the time to read it through And if you dont have time to let someone else do it You demonstrated in your statement that you didnt read the discussion carefully Thats what Im asking you to do You incorrectly assessed the arguments made and you incorrectly calculated the number of people giving an opinion This is the second time Ive asked you to defer on this same issue
