Your recent behaviour has been utterly unacceptable Despite warnings you have attacked other editors    You then aggressively crossposted to a number of users using a homophobic slur to describe those you were in dispute with  Accordingly I have blocked you for 48 hours from editing You are free to resume positive contributions after that time is up but bear in mind that personal attacks and homophobic abuse will not be tolerated scribe
