Information about Trivandrum Intl Airport

1 Best Airport  Aarem can this weasel and unreal statement please be removed This does not seem to reach consensus and being an obviously unreal statement should be removed Suggestions please
2 Distance to Airport terminals  Anyone who has been in Trivandrum for a while knows that 37km is not the distance to the airport FYI 37KM was mentioned even when the new terminal was still being built The ride from the hospital to the terminal building itself is 1KM That would mean just 27KM to the city centre Thampanoor

Please sort out

Thanks  MountainWhiskey
