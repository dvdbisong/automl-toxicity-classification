I agree that there might be a problem  however I generally agree with the changes made since Nov05 and still do  Moreover your above analysis et al is not necessarily agreeable and glazes over usage of the term which is no less valid or verifiable that might differ from cited definitions which seem IMO incomplete and minimalist  For instance an online search will reveal a number of instances of singlestar system and I think it somewhat difficult to demonstrate they they too are incorrect  Even if those are discarded applying this notion merely to systems with two or more stars double trinary to the exclusion of singlestar entities eg the Solar System seems rather illogical  Alternatively the current article and definitioncontent is neither beyond the scope of the topic nor inaccurate

Thus I defer to my prior comments until there is overwhelming evidence to support this position and I yet do not see it or additional editorial comment I see little reason to change the status quo
