I disagree with the analysis of John Z Remember in 1967 Israel agreed to UN Resolution 242 while Arab states rejected it I think it is futile to draw conclusions about the outcome of the war based on what different leaders of Egypt and Israel agreed to at different times if only because these decisions have as much to do with domestic and global situations as with the bilateral and regional conflict itself In case of Sadats peace initiative the Israeli postion was also largely determined by the style in which it was presented But again I agree with you completely that oneword interpretations have no place in the infobox or lead and arguably in the article Instead arguments from different sources and on different aspects need to be all presented and contrasted No conclusion is warranted  
 That simply isnt true about SC 242 though it is a common misapprehension  See our article or more comprehensible less battlegroundlike old versions Egypt and Jordan immediately accepted SC 242 while Israel neither accepted nor rejected it During 1968 it at first privately to the UN Secretary General and later publicly gradually accepted SC242 A clear Israeli public acceptance including the word withdrawal was not made until August 1970 as part of the IsraeliEgyptianJordanian acceptance of the Rogers B plan it was controversial enough to induce Begin to resign from the cabinet  See Shlaims Iron Wall p 260  p 296  

Yet again this complex issue needs to be properly explored within the article body I think that certain strategic benefits were seen by Israel along with some drawbacks as noted  mostly prompting renewed negotiation Israel successfully defended itself and held off joint armies again  this has probably prevented additional military adventures against Israel
Constantly grandstanding in the infobox is a futile exercise editors should use their energies more effectively by creating a comprehensive explanation   

This User Talk Page message concerns me First it accuses me of POVpushing when I was reverting POVpushing by an editor who has been changing a number of conflict infoboxes to Israeli Victory More importantly it could be regarded as Canvassing and also suggests a strategic calculation to identify and sway sidelines editors to a particular side Might I remind editors that Wikipedia is not a battleground Respectfully   

In battlefield terms the war ended with a clear Israeli victory
After the 3rd army became trapped Egypts situation was desperate
Among all warring parties Egypt was the only one that asked desperately for a truce
Not Israel
Not even Syria whose capital was shelled
This was confirmed not only by Israeli and American sources but also by the Soviet ambassador in Cairo that time

In regarding to political achievements gained by Egypt as a direct result of the war 
I am quite not sure there is a consensus about this
Not any one in Egypt saw the Camp David accord positively
Shazly claim that this was a humiliating deal that caused the expulsion of Egypt from the Arab league
If it was up to him or up to the assassins of Sadat this accord was never to be signed

Some may claim that only as a result of the war Israel accepted an Egyptian offer that it refused to accept earlier
This statement is also problematic
The peace accord was signed 5 years after war ended
There were many other events that took place during those 5 years which made Israel agree giving back the entire Sinai Peninsula
For example
Before the war Israel offered Egypt a partition of the Sinai Peninsula
Egypt will get the western Sinai in condition for peace with Israel and Israel will have the eastern part from the 1967 border to Sharm El Sheich
More than a year after the war ended the US secretary of state Henry Kissinger threatened Israel that the US will not deliver F15 airplanes to Israel unless it would agree to withdraw unilaterally from the western Sinai Peninsula
Thus the Sinai Interim Agreement of 1975 made Israel losing a fundamental play card in the negotiation with Egypt but receiving the F15 and more arms in the future
The US also started to deliver arms to Egypt in 1976 and Israel had to accept counter balancing guar
