The comment about the horns was just a joke  I was just emphasizing how this article has a lot of weasel words in it that are more opinion than fact

Ramdrake is shooting down everything I argue about  Im obviously not the only person who has issues with this article  I dont see why we cant make it longer and include all of rushtons theories while also leaving plenty of room for critics  

I think we should open this article up  I mean its better if the article is twice as long and has his theories critiques and everything  Then everyone will be happy but as the article stands it is just not very good  Ramdrake seems to want to have an article only on criticism but there are many other people who would contribute more  Lets allow them to do it  I mean the article is fairly short as it is
