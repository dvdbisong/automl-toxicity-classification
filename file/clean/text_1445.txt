A theory is comprised of research findings You are talking about research findings and theory as if they were two separet things There is no distinction between research findings and theory
What they first two comments are telling is that the research method and the theory should be split into two articles The research method is called Social network analysis and the theory is called Social network theory A researcher uses Social Network Analysis to produce information about a phenomenon called Social Network and the sum of findings constitute Social network theory

Therefore there is no distinction between theory and research findings But there should be a distinction between a sepecific research method and a theory

Thus the article whould be split into two articles as Social network and Social network analysis
