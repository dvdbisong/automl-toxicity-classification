ReAlShabaab
You have reverted to the following extract regarding foreign involvement in AlShabaab

Of the foreign members Jonathan Evans head of the British MI5 indicated in 2010 that around 100 British nationals of Pakistani Bangladeshi and West African backgrounds had traveled to Somalia to train under the group and that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK57 Their travel costs were allegedly funded by sympathizers in Britain58

This is incorrect because 1 Evans is no longer head of MI5 2 the speech that Evans gave  which was linked to in the text that you removed  made no mention of the numbers of British nationals or their ethnicity that was a bit of hyperbole added by the reporter 3 the numbers are in any case disputed with The Sunday Times estimating the number at 50 and another report from The Daily Telegraph suggesting 60 4 The citation 58 which incidentally suggests the figure of 60 does not support the assertion that travel costs are allegedly funded It does however point out the criminal conviction ie beyond reasonable doubt of an AlShabaab financier

The removal of the link to the actual speech seems particularly obtuse 861837959  

Hi Heres what you wrote

Jonathan Evans the former head of MI5 addressing a London security conference in 2010   advised that a significant number of UK residents were training with alShabaab It is only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets inspired by those who are today fighting alongside alShabaab The actual number has been estimated at between 50  and 100  persons there is also evidence of funding of the group by British citizens

First the italicization of what Evans stated back in 2010 when incidentally AlShabaab was much stronger than it is now is both undue and unencylopedic A simple predicted that their presence there could inspire terrorist incidents in the UK will suffice

In Evans speech link he indicates the following  The percentage of the priority plots and leads we see in the UK linked to Al Qaida in the tribal areas of Pakistan where Al Qaida senior leadership is still based has dropped from around 75 two or three years ago to around 50 now This does not mean that the overall threat has reduced but that it has diversified The reduction in cases linked to the Tribal areas of Pakistan is partly attributable to the pressure exerted on the Al Qaida leadership there But the reduction is also partly a result of increased activity elsewhere In Somalia for example there are a significant number of UK residents training in Al Shabaab camps to fight in the insurgency there In other words the same multinational network of wouldbe AlQaida fighters that traveled to Pakistan were also starting to travel to other areas back in 2010 including the AlShabaabcontrolled parts of Somalia Also note that Evans specifically attributes this growth in AlShabaab to the fact that Somalia like Afghanistan at the time had no effective government It does no
