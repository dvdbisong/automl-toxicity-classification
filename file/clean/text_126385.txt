Ahcene Bendjazia well dont get me started there Let me just say that he has played his part in the problems here Claiming to have a 6th dan denying to remove the claim and then he was kicked out of the GKIF in December 2001 His actions were similar to those of Nobuaki Konno both promoting themselves as something they are not Isnt that also what you are doing together with Jackie Moos Jan Christoffersen Jimmy Jørgensen Jess Petersen Steen Petersen Jan Madsen Claus Hansen Fereidun Dariagaard David Roovers etc etc etc Well most people who works with Nobuaki Konno in fact And about Ahcene Bendjazia as a last note Ahcene Bendjazia was the one presenting the evidence to Kunihiko Tosa on May 6th 1996 The evidence was clearly showing without a shred of doubt that Nobuaki Konno was making false and fake certificates using Kunihiko Tosas name Seiken Shukumines name etc on certificates that was never approved by Genseiryū handed out and sold to studentsinstructors in Denmark Finland Holland Sweden etc showing that they were all awarded a rank in Genseiryū even though Nobuaki Konno was never authorized to hold such examinations nor to make sell andor hand out these certificates It is old news why are you having such a hard time accepting these facts Oh yes perhaps because this is the past of Nobuaki Konno making you have to apologize to me for slandering and defamation You have been and you still are the culprit in promotion and fighting for these people who have in fact build their entire karate career on lies and deceit You are entitled to have your own believes but you should not fight everyone else who do not agree with your ignorant andor rigid perception of the situation and world around you
