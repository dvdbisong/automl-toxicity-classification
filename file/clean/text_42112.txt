Videology page deletion 

Hi there This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday The reason given was because there was no explanation of significance I was wondering if I could get more clarification

According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant It also states The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible In terms of credibility it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch

As an aside Id be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles such as TubeMogul YuMe and Adaptv Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology

Im very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter

Thank you for your help time and assistance
