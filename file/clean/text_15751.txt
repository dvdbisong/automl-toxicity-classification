LNL theme music
I propose to restore the LNL theme music reference deleted by  with this one line

Late Night Lives theme music is Elana KatsChernins Russian Rags which Adams calls the Waltz of the Wombat The previous theme was Bachs concerto for oboe violin and orchestra in C Minor BWV 1060 III Allegro

Any objections Ill wait a few days before making the change
