So to clarify  THIS is rude to you 

To clarify its not just the infobox livelikemusic wants them omitted from Theyre not currently mentioned in the body of the article and livelikemusic wants it to stay that way as well as having them removed from the infobox In essence livelikemusic wants them to not exist Please see her comments on the Theresa Donovan talk pageCebr1979 talk 

Cause actually theres nothing rude about it Its stating facts The info is not in the body of the page nor does she want it to be and she does all want it removed from the infobox She does want them to not exist and her comments on the Theresa Donovan talk page explicitly state that Odd you would allow her to run to you as an admin without notifying me as the rules for contacting an admin should in theory be the same as contacting submitting a complaint to ANI Also odd you wouldnt bother to look into it before acting
