This is not season 5 Historys own webpage which is correct  you cannot argue against the people who make it says these new episodes are part of season 4 On iTunes it shows that these new episodes are season 5 but this is wrong For a while Historys own webpage had these episodes down as season 5 but reverted it a couple of weeks in to the series Also look at the Complete Series 4 Top Gear USA DVD It was released in December of last year and contains these episodes that we are discussing along with the ten we can both agree were in series 4 SERIES 5 HAS NOT BEEN MADE YET
