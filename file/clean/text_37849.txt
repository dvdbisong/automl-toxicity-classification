Yeah you kinda did I felt and I took it that way Your first post noted my username and as a result you stated UserYsfan  who clearly has a fixation on Ysrelated articles Minor jab sure but yeah saying I have a fixation was meant as a negative qualityinsult given the context You can justify the childish rampage comment but I can justify the action in that when you dont feel you can deal with someone you resort to titfortat measures to see how they like having their content targeted monitored like a hawk for excisingediting like he had been doing and show disrespect by never contacting the other person by the 2nd or so time And the worst of it was to play innocent and pretend you had no idea why it was occurring when you knew full well you were engaging in an editing war with someone So anyway I didnt appreciate the fixation comment but from your perspective you were justified in the rampage comment
