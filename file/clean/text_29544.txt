Manson  Shaved heads 

Having taken a quick look at the pages you cited I think youre right that the heads were not shaved in response to the guilty verdicts I misread the caption of the photograph between pages 340 and 341  Does the text indicate when the Family members other than the defendants shaved their heads Youve written that they waited until the penalty phase was almost over but on page 455 which you cite only the female defendants are mentioned
