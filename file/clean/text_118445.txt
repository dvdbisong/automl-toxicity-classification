Ok now youve screwed it up 

Originally the article title was under Constitution of May 3 1791 This is the title under which it passed GA review

There is some discussion about the name above  with alternative names suggested by an anon IP and pretty much opposed by all established editors who have been active on this article including on bringing it up to GA

Then however before the discussion was concluded and any kind of consensus reached UserTCO moved the article to Polish constitution of May 3 1791 There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources

Then UserMK moved the article to PolishLithuanian constitution of May 3 1791 There are several problems with this title some of which have been raised above one big one being that it is not the name as used in most sources Actually this ones used in hardly ANY sources

MK also messed with the httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitlePolish_constitution_of_May_3_1791redirectno Polish constitution of May 3 1791 redirect which makes it pretty much impossible to manually move the article back to its original title without admin tools Whether this was done deliberately as a salting or not I have no idea

The thing is that in order to move this article what SHOULDVE been done is to have a proper REQUEST MOVE Now we got a title which is not used by any sources and trouble moving it back

Heres the break down on stats

For PolishLithuanian constitution of May 3 1791  we have 2 hits Thats right two And one of them is Molieres Tartuffe so I dont think particularly relevant The other hit from TimeLife books doesnt even have snippet preview so we cant check whether its actually about the topic

For Polish constitution of May 3 1791  we have 39 hits Thats thirty nine Browsing through some of the hits a lot of these seem to be very outdated ie contemporary with the document

For Constitution of May 3 1791 the original title that the article passed GA under we have  87 hits Thats eightyseven 

For Constitution of May 3 without the 1791  we get 114 hits And it looks like most if not all of them are in fact about this document

So Constitution of May 3 or Constitution of May 3 1791 greatly outnumbers other variations that have been invented here on Wikipedia Per WPPRIMARY WPNOR and WPNC the article should be moved back to its original title Then if there still any doubt about what the sources call this document someone can start a proper WPRM
