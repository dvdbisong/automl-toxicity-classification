Florian Gate  St Florians Gate 

Hi Pmanderson  As the Mediation Comittee are unable to assist in settling the naming dispute on TalkSt Florians Gate as you refused to agree to mediation with no reason provided I have tried to settle this dispute before it proceeds to the only subsequent step which is the Arbitration Committee 

I have suggested Florians Gate as a compromise and thus far all parties have indicated this would be acceptable  Would you be happy with this
