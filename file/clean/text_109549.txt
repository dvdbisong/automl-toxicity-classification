NimzoIndian 

I agree 100 that the article should be NimzoIndian Defence with a redirect from NimzoIndian
We have the same problem with the BogoIndian
Since articles already exist at the redirects and they have had edits we cant do the move ourselves
Probably the best bet is to ask UserSjakkalle to make the move as hes an admin
Hes also a chess player so hell understand why the full names are better
I wrote Defence above instead of Defense since it looks like that article was originally created using British spelling
The wikipedia practice is to conform to the spelling that was used to create the article
If the article is about a clearly British subject British spelling should be used and the reverse if its a US subject
