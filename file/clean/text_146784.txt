The Wikipedia Nazis  are legion and have little real biographical or contextual knowledge but have taken charge of the Ramana Maharshi article and nothing really can be done Ive seen this before They have no interest In discussion it is just a chess game to them and they are already working together to build a case to justify ignoring and shutting you out The best you can do is try and keep biographical information accurate They are determined to distort Hinduism much as Wendy Doniger has successfully done It works because all these peacock editors want to do is puff up their egos and exert power Dont assume good faith there is none
