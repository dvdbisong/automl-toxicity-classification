Things like in my experience seems to and from my experience are examples of what is considered original research here on Wikipedia Wikipedia policy is that only wpverifiable information can be placed in the articles While the references you point to might make a nice addition to the Montessori method article I didnt see anything relevant to the educational accreditation article Note that those references still dont seem to support your assertions on this talk page at least not directly enough for them to go into any Wikipedia article Thanks
