Flagship is singular 

Many states have two or more excellent state universities often one may exceed the other on one or another measure of excellence  But a state with two excellent universities has that  not two flagships  Flagship is a singular term  a good reference for the word generally can be found here  In this context flagship means as the introduction says the leading comprehensive public research university in a given US state  The only sort of exception that makes sense in this context is a system like New Yorks where the state university system resembles a system of franchises more than anything else  With this in mind Ive edited the list to remove some schools that are plainly not a states flagship  I left a states entry alone if I wasnt sure and so some doubleentries do remain someone who knows those schools better should fix those

As the edit summary says I also removed a couple of external links that required paid subscriptions in order to view per WPLinks to be avoided
