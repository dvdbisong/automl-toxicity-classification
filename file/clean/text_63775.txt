Well if I ask your question Is it acceptable I have to ask first and foremost does it meet WPNPOV  To me it does not and therefore it is unacceptable  There is absolutely no external source that I can address that says The phrase waterboarding is a form of torture is acceptable per wikipedias NPOV policy Nor one that addres that says The phrase waterboarding is _________________ is acceptable per wikipedias NPOV policy  There is no such source and the poll is certainly one of those sources that I am unable to use HOWEVER if instead I read the policy and apply the evidence to the policy the question comes up Is it disputed  The poll indicates that it is disputed  That is how the information in the poll is used  It is completely inadequate to determine if in fact waterboarding is torture or if wikipedia should say one thing or the other But it is NOT inadequate to determining if there is a dispute which is a key means of checking for NPOV
