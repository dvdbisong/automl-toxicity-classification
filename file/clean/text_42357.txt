Parkwells yes I went to the source you referredlinked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jeffersons Farm Book7 as being visitors to Monticello The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors but lists an accounting of his plantations eg livestock land crops costs and slaves Not a logbook of visitors Hardly compellingSchulz your notion that Hylands book has been ignored by scholars simply because it is not mentioned at the cite you linked to is ridiculous esp since it has indeed been endorsed by many scholars including former members of the TJF Hyland is Adjunct Professor at Stetson University College of Law at Tampa Bay Florida If you think that Hyland is dead why dont you send him an email  WHYLANDtravelerscom and see how he feels about that You have the wrong Hyland Hylands book came out in 2009 the Hyland youre referring to died in 2008 Please do you homework And if you are ready to dismiss a source because of two spelling errors it is clear that your mind is quite closed and simply cant come to terms with the idea that there are a whole body of historians professors who exist outside of the box you seem to have enclosed yourself in Even Albert Einstein was a poor speller Btw in the same paragraph you make issue with spelling errors you make a grammatical error leaving a word out of your sentence That said Hylands book is not a particularly good book Is this your way of saying youre not reliable  Unbelievable Both of you are clutching at straws and are not being fair to other points of view
