Calm down dont exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone  Anyhow I did provide evidence but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs  So Ali knew Persian eh  I suppose you have evidence for this  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy
Ali then came up to the princess and asked What is your name The princess replied The daughter of Jahanshah Ali said and so Shahrbanuyeh you will be called the bride of the land

Do you honestly believe that  That claim is embarrassingly stupid  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo who was clearly captured by the Arabs married Hussayn willingly Oh and for your good information there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo and the Arabs didnt gave her that name  Even if and Arab knew some Persian what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of landcountry and city for shahr  At any rate the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo and if her name was given by Ali to her the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name Besides didnt it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name   0652 28 Feb 2005 UTC
