CheeseDreams and Historicity of Jesus 

Firstly thanks for kind comments on my user page They were totally appreciated Im in a much better state now so Ill be reverting back Its good to know that people are very kind on this site though  

note that Im sending this message to a few people as a general call for help Anyway back to the point Ive posted this to WPAN Can I please get advise on how to deal with the extensive changes that CheeseDreams is making on this article Shes running roughshod over everyone on an extremely controversial article Its already been stuffed up due to this users edits and had to be protected by RickK in its highly POV and badly structured form at one point there were essentially TWO articles on the one page Now CheeseDreams is making a massive change without using the talk page and it adding sections that dont even have any content in it Ive reverted back and have requested that she bring her changes to the talk page I would appreciate advise on how to procede with this I dont particularly want to engage in an edit war with her   1358 14 Dec 2004 UTC
