Levellers
In the section LevellersOrigin_of_name there is the following text
It first appeared in print in a book written by Charles I called His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration first sold around 15 November 1647
On the 11th of November 1647 the King Charles R send a message to the Speaker of the House of Lords in which he talks about the Levellers this is a letter in which he states that he is forced to flee from Hampton Court The King arrived on the Isle of Wight on the 14th and stays with the Governor Robert Hammond And as the King was effectively being held a prisoner by Colonel HammondCharles_I_of_EnglandEnglish_Civil_war long after the 16th 
Which made me wonder who started selling the book and whether the book was sold despite or because of the tumult As this all occurs in between the First English Civil War which ended May of 1646 and the Second English Civil War Naturally at the time His Majesties Most Gracious Declaration was published there was no foresight that predicted the Second English Civil War but it might be considered slightly inflammatory And although I dont doubt the book is genuine it is plain that Charles I had little to do with the sale as he was on the Isle of Wight
