When I discussed with UserMarkSweep on a private IRC session about any post made between 1235 and 1652 he pointed the following out to me

partial chat exerpt from the other day

mark_sweep you posted on markalexanders talk page at 1340 UTC
mark_sweep then at 1342 UTC you posted to the reference desk

Shultzii Those posts you just pointed out theyre troll posts I dont see how they are
Shultzii They look pretty innocent to me
mark_sweep thats what makes them troll posts
Shultzii Making a wikilink and pointing it out scratches head
Shultzii Ill take a 2nd look at his talk page
mark_sweep the original question may look innocent but it was pretty pointless thats why people consider it trolling
mark_sweep heres the thing
Shultzii Oh about the thought of naming a new city of Hoeryong somewhere in the US
mark_sweep yes but its not even that
mark_sweep heres the thing
Shultzii Go ahead Taking food out of microwave
mark_sweep an admin asks you to stop
mark_sweep more or less accusing you of being a troll
mark_sweep you continue with the same thing you were doing
mark_sweep which only confirms his suspicion

All I was doing was disambiguating what someone was thinking They misconstrued Hoeryong as a Dutch phrase meaning Child of a w In the ref desk entry from the beginning I meant what if I named a new town after a Korean city Therefore I had to tell UserDirkvdM that Hoeryong in the way it was intended would be named after a Korean city not a Dutch phrase Not once did it ever even cross my mind that this was a continuation of a trollish act MarkAlexander misconstrued it as such so can someone please lift the block early
