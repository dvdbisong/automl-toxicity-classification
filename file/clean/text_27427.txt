NOT a ghost town 

Whoever wrote this has never been to Rosita  While no longer incorporated it can still be found on Google or Bing Maps  There are dozens of homes there and many more in the surrounding area so it can hardly be called a ghost town  Unfortunately There are very few remnants of the original town other than the cemetery
