Inventor or Developer 
A recent addition was made to the article about a supposed early developer of the capsule endoscope It needed a reference so I reverted to an earlier version Normally Id add a citation tag but the editor himself made various claims about capsule endoscopy inventors and how he himself had a problem with mentions of such people without references I thought that was odd If there is a reference Id be happy to add it but from my research there seems to be conflicts among many as to who first created it
