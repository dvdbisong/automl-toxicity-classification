If you go to Dbachmanns talk page you will notice that he and Hiberniantears have been discussing ways to control this article They have branded the other editors here trolls and socks and it is obvious that Hiberniantears aims to work with Dbachmann to fulfill whatever agenda he has planned for this article I recommend seeking aid from objective Admins to stop them from destroying all of the progress that has been made on this article over the past few months These two are only interested in stamping out heresy You cannot trust someone who brands you a threat to Wikipedia
