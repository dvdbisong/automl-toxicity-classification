See you are just so cute and I can work with you  You arent a Tweedle and you have good things to contribute  Give me tomorrow and Ill create an article because it is notable as a national charity and then change the link  I only added the link to the external site because we dont have an article already  The MSNBC article works as a source of notability  If you want to start it tonight thats great otherwise Ill start it tomorrow  Im sure we can figure out the best way but for now I think leaving the link is acceptable  And yeah I really hate that TW thing  It goes back a long way
