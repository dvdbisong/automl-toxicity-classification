Canola oil is rapeseed oil but rapeseed oil isnt necessary canola oil They developed a cultivar of rape I think it was in the 1970s that has low ecruic acid levels and once they got the US to approve the new name canola is CANadian OiL it only took about 23 years before farmers were growing large quantities I cant see women buying rape oil Even if they know better it sounds like an antisocial alternative to KY jelly 

If I recall correctly regular rape oil is a drying oil mostly used industrially perhaps in some specialty paints Its toxic but I dont know how toxic A lot of the foods we eat are toxic Salt is a necessity but a cup of salt would be lethal to half of all adults who ingest it  

 thanks from me too 

Not much time on my hands these days but when I see something that is wrong I have a hard time leaving it alone Not a desirable character trait Ill have you know They say dentists and computer programmers have a high suicide rate but I suspect copyeditors proofreaders and fact checkers probably have a high rate of getting murdered God knows the SOBs deserve it I see that youve been busy And you can take the fact that you dont see my edits very often as a HIGH compliment
