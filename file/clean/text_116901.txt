About the Sanskrit derivations
We in India have been talking in Hindi and Sanskrit for millenia till today The similarity between geometry and gyamiti is not coincidental You can yourself search the translation of geometry in Sanskrit or Hindi and check and confirm But anyways I know the west is too full to acknowledge non western contribution or influence on anything So I am not gonna say anything Change as you like For now Its a western world but not for long
