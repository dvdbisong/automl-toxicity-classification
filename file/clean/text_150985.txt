I find Sandsteins dealing with the Mbz1 phenomenon very professional He removed the soapbox image from that users page and also banned you for not complying with your topic ban It is you the one who is not assimilating the teaching of your topic ban For example You are topic banned because you dont have a professional approach to IP topic and in general to any topic related to Jews and Judaism The most resent example When you reported that soapbox you qualified it as antisemitic You at least should get informed of what that is A neutral approach would be to have called it as soapbox canvasing and thats it You should focus in your pictures which is the thing that you manage to do relatively well Once you get into your holly war program of fighting all that in your imagination is an attack to Judaism you simply behave stupidly It is those kinds of behaviors the ones that keep bringing hatred to us That kind of attitude is know it racist and if you are true to the struggles of the people of Abraham you above all should regret behaving as a racist Once more focus on your pictures and maybe even Sandstein will take a like on you
