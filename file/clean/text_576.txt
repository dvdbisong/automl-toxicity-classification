4meter4s sigh and my concerns 
Only because Mr 4meter4 had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far I did not have a single chance to develop it His article called falsetto is not about falsetto It may be about his arrogance who knows There are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects In England Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos On the top of it Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto or the falsetto of Ian Gillan Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto What about Michael Kiske Is it not falsetto Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do did not sing falsetto Does any of these falsettos sound breathy Not to me Isnt out there published a note about those Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it Why It would not fit to his article He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World The whole physiology of his only falsetto is based on encyclopedia Well perhaps it is enough for Wikipedia or himself But not for me No There is much more out there only regarding physiology Much much more And just because you allow idiots like 4meter4 to develop Wikipedia the people the readers of Wikipedia will read shit Where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at 60ies Mr Know Everything Feel free to block me again I have no desire to write here any more
