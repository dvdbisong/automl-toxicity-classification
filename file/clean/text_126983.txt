I would like to add a stub on the penisula medical school Maybe if and when the block is lifted i can do so but i do not want it linked to a shopping mall  can we seperate the two completely  its like reading an article on Maddison Sqaure and finding a buy viagra in NYC link stuck in the middle of it  Preceding unsigned comment added by  talk  contribs  

You would have more credibility if your first of only 2 edits hadnt been to vandalise one of the articles Im working on just like the other trolls and sockpuppets But to answer your question theres no difficulty in either adding the details to this Drake Circus article thereby avoiding the despised Drake Circus Shopping Centre article or by creating a whole new article You will of course have to meet the WP notability requirements if you choose the latter Of course if you wish to do the former youll have to wait until the protection runs out alternatively you can place the details here and an experienced editor will do it for you   

I published an article on a poet and then because I also wanted to feature an article on the Peninsula medical school in drake circus I came here I read all that you have deleted over the months and from that I learnt you are not allowed to link to spam so applying your rules I removed the spam link from your article
So you are saying you are the only person allowed to edit an article And that if anyone dare to remove your spam they are just like other trolls and sockpuppets
I suggest that unless you have anything constructive to say you stop insulting people and go away 
I have no interest in either where you came from or where you go When your first edit is to delete something from an article using a spurious excuse like spam then that is vandalism Before you delete anything else from any other article I suggest you bone up on the guidelines first The requisite article you needed to be aware of for your first edit was WPEL likewise a quick lesson in commonsense would also be handy ie a link to a Manchester history website in an article about a Manchester historical establishment couldnt be construed as spam by any stretch of the imagination   
Incidentally you created the mofoster article almost an hour after you deleted the spam link You really need to learn how WP works before trying to game the system   

You really need to learn how WP works
you mean if some guy tries to publish an article that might compete with one of yours they will be blocked and their article trashed

reading through all this i find it hard to believe its all about spam  firstly Google respects Wps nofollow attribute in the links tabs and secondly they have an index for example of known spammers of for example social networking sites I personally would like more emphasis in the article on the computer sciences in Drake circus as that is what it is becoming more rapidly known for
