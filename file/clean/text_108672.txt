I also support FinnoUgric mythologies as a plural term because there is no just one mythology or system of myths but different and  diverse FinnoUgric mythologies Some kind of an analogy for this is how we name the groups of languages we do not speak of common FinnoUgric language but FinnoUgric languages plural BalticFinnic mythology is still acceptable as a singular term because BalticFinnic mythologies share very much with each other Kalevala for example is collected from speakers of different baltic Finnic languages But there could not be an opus of FennoUgric or FennoVolgaic mythology it would just be a mess of unrelated material and languages that are not mutually intelligible  puhu
