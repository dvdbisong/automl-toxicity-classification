Hello thank you for the kindly reply in the Bruce Lee book  about martial arts legend Bruce Lee written by his widow Linda Lee Cadwell it is declared that Warner Brothers took away the part of The Warrior and turned it into KungFu for the above reasons already mentioned

It is agreed that the movie with Jason Scott Lee that took some dramatic licence or elements of course for some of the dramatic purposes only however the movie was actually based on the book by Bruces widow Linda and written shortly after his death also that it was Linda herself Mrs Bruce Lee herself who did the final narration at the films end

The George Takei narrated video is also a worthy review wiki friend as it does in fact state what was cited in regard to the Studio taking his idea of The Warrior in that it was giving a new name and another actor for the earlier reasons specified in my careful edit you helped me realise on the page

很佩服你

祝你过一个好天
