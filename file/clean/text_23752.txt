Unfortunately for us what you hypothesized from standing in the tower yourself is in violation of WikipediaNo original research Our job is to report the circumstances not try to interpret them Imagine what a mess George W Bush Osama bin Laden or Adolf Hitler would be if every user got to add their own personal theories WP would cease to be a reliable source used by students reporters and others and would become just another messageboard of squabbling Sherurcij 
I dont have to imagine what a mess George Bush Osama and Hilter wereare that is self evident like your knowledge of Whitman and the record Are you being paid for contibutions to Wiki You mention job as a function We are now beyond repair as credible to each other The rules you stick to say original research is permitted under certain circumstances I am qualified to meet that burden of proof but you and jareha deem yourselves guardian of the rules even though you have no clue about why Whitman did the sniping or any regard for the victims of that day or anyone else associated with it Go ahead post another rule Subwayjack
