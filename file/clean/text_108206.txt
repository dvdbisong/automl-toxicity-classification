I say remove the sentence Heres why and I think my idea may be novel  Yes some said I hate Muslims  However we need to look at the context  In the heat of a demonstration regarding a certain limited issue they shouted I hate Muslims  There is no evidence that they hate Muslims generally  There are many many Muslims in the world and all of them cannot be put into the little box that represented those involved in the demonstration  So by putting what they shouted at a demonstration against a relatively limited few in the lead paragraph without proper contextualization the implication is made that they hate all Muslims not just those involved in the demonstration and that would violate various Wiki policies
