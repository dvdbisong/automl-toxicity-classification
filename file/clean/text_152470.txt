5 On another note and this is the MOST important issue with the page Unless UserAivazovsky can present claims to scholarship and credibility of Andrew Andersen PhD as a researcher with publications or books on the region proven to be NPOV any quotes to Andersen or to the maps made under this name shall be purged out of the page Those references and invented maps become a subject of unfounded claims of one country against another and should have no place at Wikipedia 

Thanks
