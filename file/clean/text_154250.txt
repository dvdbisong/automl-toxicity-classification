A little request 

Hi

I haved deleted all Islamic related articles in some articles of Chinese dynasties I think  and look at his contributions werent a vandal but he could be an extremely Muslim because he was added his Islamic articles which all were superfluous and unneeded its just like promotion or advertising for his IslamAnd I appreciate your neutral revisions

Could you send a warning for his vandalism because you are one of the professional contributors in Chinese ralated articlesThank so much and best wishes to you in 2008
