I was just wonderin if you could answer me a question  I dont really understand the deal with the photos and all that goes with them  I mean this whole site is a basic free for all and anyone and everyone can do anything and everything to it  So why is it that when someone adds a photo to it theyve got to get permission to use it  Now myself I look at this as a waste of time because of the simple fact that there are a zillion photos of anything and everything out there that people use  As long as you are giving credit to where you got it I dont see the big deal  Now that is the same thing with anything and everything that is on this site  If you the powers that be want to be so picky about photos why arent they picky about the information that people put in the entries  I mean Ive gone on to some peoples bios and shows and have seen things literally plagiarized word for word from one source or another  Im just really curious why they are so stingent about some things but not others
If you could help me out and answer some of these things or if there is someone who might be able to I would appreciate it  If you could please contact me at catsfanatic_1999yahoocom instead of replying here since I only come on here every so often 
Thanks 
Charley
