One of the core elements on Wikipedia is verifiability by reliable sources The nice thing of the article as it is now is that there are quite some footnotes to sources used although unfortunately either unreliable or misinterpreted by the authors of the opening paragraph So accompanying your edits with sufficient inline citations to journals and pages in books will be of great help
