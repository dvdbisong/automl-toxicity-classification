Slow down please 

Greetings Ckatz I have undone your summary reversion of my contribution to Right and lefthand traffic It was unilateral and done without discussion based solely on your personal preference That is not how it works and as an administrator you fully well know that Your adminship does not make you entitled to go around declaring contributions by veteran editors with good track records unworthy and you know that too I have no desire to pick a fight with you but it looks like you might be forgetting yourself Please take a few breaths and remember that admins have special tools but not special rights you are not exempt from the core principles and protocols that govern all contributors to this collaborative project As for the question of whether my version or the previous version was better well take that up at the articles talk page thank you see you there  TC
