all you people reallyreally think newbies are going to spend hrs reading polices they 
100 hate

Many do NOT LIKE these rules and laws They want CHANGE The organizers were WRONG
Many newbies do not see these policies as anything to respect We might read them someday
but do not respect them

You use these policies to suppress new info

Now what about TV PROGRAMS AS A SOURCE

Dr Michio Kaku is quoted on ABC that he feels UFOs use wormholes

YOU GONNA IGNORE THAT

I will send in the quote here 

Is ABC reputable enough for you Or does it have to be a an author who has 50 libel items in her book Is she reputable
