This is by far the best attitude and the most helpful suggestions I have been offered here since joining and I want to thank you for this  I am probably not blameless in my attitude and my frustration during the review process did cause me to make some statements there which I though humorous at the time which are now being held against me  I did try to mostly address the argument and not the person especially during AFD I do feel though that I offered definite proof of bias during both AFD and review and the act of doing this is now used to accuse me of personal attack  You can read and decide for yourself exactly what happened during review httpenwikipediaorgwikiWikipediaDeletion_reviewLog2011_February_8Bruce_Copley I think your suggestion of userfying the article is really helpful and I should go that way  If you want to see the article there is a Google cache at httpwebcachegoogleusercontentcomsearchqcachePV1AoAdknbwJenwikipediaorgwikiBruce_CopleyBruceCopleycd5hlenctclnkglzaclientfirefoxasourcewwwgooglecoza  Any questions and criticisms you have after reading the article are most probably already addressed during AFD or review and I was busy responding to the last persons criticisms at AFD but did not have the chance to post before the page suddenly got deleted so if you want I can send you this response as well  At the moment though I am happy to take a break so I have no problem with waiting 7 days  I want to thank you again for your constructive offer of help and I really wished you had joined the discussion earlier  Best
