Old version of this article 

Weve had some problems over the last 24 hours or so from various people who want to reinstate content that previously existed in the article That content was removed because the sources  where it was sourced at all  were not reliable the phrasing was all wrong for an encyclopedia etc This is why we currently have a singlesentence unreferenced stubObviously such a stub is far from ideal but that is not in itself a reason to reinstate material that contravenes our policies and guidelines for example WPV and WPRS At some point Ill probably be able to expand the article myself but anyone can do so there is no need to wait for me probided that you comply with the aforesaid policies etc Thanks
