Hi Joey Thanks for closing the merger proposal discussion  Looking back at my answer to Jmajeremy just made me laugh It only dates back from last year but at the time I did not know much about Wikipedia so I just replied expressing my feelings without good arguments I wrote in capital letters wich I know now is inappropriate and used WPOTHERSTUFF lol I was so mad at Jmajeremy because I had spent hours to find sources etc Anyway Im so glad the discussion is closed even if my arguments were not solid
