I just read WPBATTLE and WPAGF and accordingly I find your message to Davey mentioning me in that context while deliberately trying to hide it from me as extremely upsetting I have nothing personal against Davey despite what he claims I am certainly not trying to make him afraid or upset or otherwise miserable If he tries to claim I am I will vigorously defend myself against such lies If anyone has been treated unfairly it has been me by him  he reported me for being a VANDAL for crying out loud I assume you know exactly how wrong that was I sadly only properly realised that after the event AGF says If criticism is needed discuss editors actions but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence Well I have quite a lot of clear evidence now that Daveys lack of care in the subject area of busesbus transport can only really be explained by him having a motive that is harmful to Wikipedia to degrade the overall quantity and quality of its content on the subject How else can you explain the phenomena of someone who claims to be a bus enthusiast and know a lot about buses not having any clue how or why a list of trolleybus routes would be encyclopedic Entire books have been written on just that subject This is just one example I have many more If he had never claimed to know a lot about this subject then yes I could have assumed that this was just a case of amateurish but entirely innocent intent But not any more He clearly has a very specific idea about what Wikipedia should and should not contain on this subject and it is quite clearly not explicitly supported by any of the rules So he is pushing the envelope far beyond the limits and in some cases theres only one word to describe the things he says  pure lies Im sorry hes upset by the fact that I have the subject knowledge to be able to spot when hes not being truthful about certain things he says on this subject and Im sorry that hes upset that when he says something here breaks some rule or other I actually take the time to check if thats true or not But do not for a second confuse that with someone who is genuinely upset by someone stalking them or questioning their motives for no good reason I could even go so far to say these might even be crocodile tears since he doesnt appear to have been this sensitive over other issues where people are disagreeing with him  indeed he seems quite capable of telling people in no uncertain terms what he thinks of them This is no shrinking violet thats for sure
