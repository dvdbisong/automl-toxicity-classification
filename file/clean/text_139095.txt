Vadalism etc
Hi thaks for the message You accidentally put it on my user page instead of the talk page so it got reverted by another user I guess You Can Act Like a Man has decided hes in some sort of feud with me because of a dispute about the page on Richard III of England hes one of those people who has decided that Richard was really a nice guy awesome ruler and loving uncle so the page should not say bad stuff about him Unfortunately he does not live up to his user name As far as I know he has no intetest in BI as such Im not sure which user is reverting your edits Is it John C or You Can Act Like a Man
