Damac censors the truth again 

Again Damac has shown that he regards this site as his personal property  The argument I wrote under the title The Truth about the 1986 Sinn FÃ©in Ard Fheis was not a party political statement but my own composition  It seems that writing any argument on Wikipedia is OK as long as it dosnt conflict with Damacs views  He gives a link to a political debate site where I also posted the same argument  Why should Wikipedia users be directed to a political debate site to read arguments that were composed for this site and then posted on the debate site  That my composition was posted here on this site can be seen by checking the time of posting my argument here and checking the time I posted it on Politics ie  I think genuine Wikipedia users can make up their own mind about Damacs motives  Fortunately Damacs ability to censor is limited here as readers can review the history of this page by pressing the History button
