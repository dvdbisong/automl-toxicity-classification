Trolling  

More trolling by Erwin Walsh

At this point Erwin has resumed trolling yet again and is trollishly taunting Cool Cat at his leisure which I hope he realises is not permitted and in any case hes been warned He also leaves the comment unsigned which is funny because I had made an entry on the talk page here and other trolling situations in the past Erwins response to your warning was to ignore both comments and proceed with another blatent attempt at trolling This is really not a nice thing to do but assume good faith and all that Talk
