Using that logic ordering them as on ABC Medianet one could make just as strong an argument that the cast should be listed in the order of their cast bios here on the offical ABC Greys Anatomy page  That would put James Pickens Jr ahead of everyone except Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey  One could also argue that they should be listed based on what theyre paid since those figures were recently reported in which case Isaiah Washington and Katherine Heigl could well wind up on the bottom of the list  I really think that listing them in billing orderthe traditional method as pointed out by the above responsemakes the most sense  I wont revert it yet hopefully some other people will add their opinions so we can establish a better consensus
