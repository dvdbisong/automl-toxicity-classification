DOB not known in credible sources 
A fellow contributor at werelateorg offers that

He was not born on the 9th  When he was actually born is unknown What is known is that he was baptized on the 16th  If you look at the bottom of the page the source used for this is actually a random GEDCOM site with all unsourced information  they have a hilariously long Webster line that is complete fantasy

And although I havent gotten around to it I believe his death date may actually be a burial date but I need to confirm that
