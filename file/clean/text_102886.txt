True the current page is way to unsourcedthus opening the door for disucssion such as the Italy one above I have added some sources for three current great power and will try and add further refs for the current great power Unfortunately I am not a historian for Asian history so I do not really know whether or not all these Dynasties were Great PowersI think your right thought it is an induatrial age term Purging unreferenced info is probably our only and best option Regards
