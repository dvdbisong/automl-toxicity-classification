History

During the winter supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle Although meat would be available from deer parks this couldnt supply the needs of the whole household A fish pond provided an elegant solution As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond fish required no feeding and were available all year round There would usually be a series of ponds with fish being moved between them as they grew
