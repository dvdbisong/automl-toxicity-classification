Dear Fredil thank you so much for your beautiful words your kidness and your trust in me My Request for Adminship is finally over and the support and appreciation that the community has gifted me will stick in my mind as long as I live I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all youve done for me and all I can tell you is Ill try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons and if I mess up make sure to come here and give me a good yell  Seriously tho if you ever need my help either for adminrelated stuff or in any other way youll always be welcome to message me and I promise Ill try my very best
Dear Fredil I know that your faith in Wikipedia is shaken right now and tho I didnt have the pleasure of talking to ILP myself I also feel that his departure is saddening indeed In moments like this when everything looks dark is when friendship true friendship shines with a brighter light ILP understood the value of that friendship better than most people do I cant think of a better way to keep his thoughts a living part of our project than offering myself as your own friend and know that I dont take such an offer lightly Valuable and great peple like you are rare to find dear Fredil There is much beauty in this place and wonderful people Dont let the darkness take over you  Ill do my very best to help you keep the light shining bright I promise  With a big hug your friend
