Sorry but I think thats a bit too much There was a whole discussion on the topic of flagship earlier and I think we should steer clear of the word since a consensus cannot be reached regarding it However I made one change in the intro to differentiate BYU from its sister schools saying it is the the oldest existing institution in its LDS Churchs Church Educational System This is a fact and elaborates on the CES template at the bottom of the article Hope this helps
