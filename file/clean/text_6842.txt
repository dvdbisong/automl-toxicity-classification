here the user said I am arrogant in Portuguese E para piorar é arrogante Translation And even worse he is arrogant

He also called me crazy louco in Portuguese Só encontro loucos aqui Translation I only find crazy people here

These comments are not welcome Anyway I do not want to be label as crazy or arrogant only because I did not agree with images being moved with no need or an euphemism of a Black woman being reported as Pardo Its easy to accuse other people of ownership because the person protects articles from these types of adits
