Why delete the reference to SNL and the Begala Award  There is criticism for Begala being very partisan in the face of facts  There are lots of folks on both the left and right in that campbut it is a legitimate point to make  I agree the actual lines from SNL ie Matthews fetus comment are not appropriate
