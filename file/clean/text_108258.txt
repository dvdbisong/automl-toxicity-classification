Linux vs GNULinux

20040531 2345 Hi David Gerard

You seem to have removed all the clarifications of the previously vague text  Encyclopedias should be impartial and correct  You have put back all the confused use of Linux and removed spellinggrammar corrections  Really the Linux distributions entry should be clear about what it is and impartial to any of your leanings  The version you have reverted to is an umbrella description which could be read as matching more than it in fact does  The text should reflect correct and actual use of the term including any that others may consider incorrect it just should not blot out eitheror as it does mostly at present

Ok and for the other minor revisions you removed

eg  eg
eg is just incorrectly spelt eg is the abbreviation of latin exampli gratia and should be written eg see OED for reference please

predetermined  predetermined

preconfigure  preconfigure
requires hyphen as conjoined words

PCs  IBM compatible PCs
PCs is an abbreviation of Personal Computers this case only refers to IBM compatible PCs  Not Apple PCs for example  So presently 

targeted for China   targeted at the Chinese market
grammar is simply wrong

In the Xandros section
commercial  proprietary
Are you unaware that GNULinux is typically commercial so the commercial point is irrelevant the relevant point is that it is PROPRIETARY commercial software  There is  no point emphasising  a pointless piece of information

cooperation  cooperation
requires hyphen as conjoined words

If you hold some position of seniority here please consider putting my clarifications back in  At least consider the grammatical and spelling revisions if you are intent on the Linux use being unsuitable as present

Glad to see you did not revert my Proprietary software revision

My comments in this post are intended to be polite please do not consider my explanations patronising

Cheers now3d

I dont hold a position of editorial seniority there isnt any such thing However the Linux to GNULinux stuff is clearly partisanism and POVpushing Please reread TalkLinux and TalkGNULinux naming controversy And NPOV In English Linux is far and away the most common name for what you and I would prefer to be called GNULinux pretending it isnt would not to my mind be appropriate

Typos eg youre right on the others I think are arguable either way Ill have a look through   1300 1 Jun 2004 UTC

Ive had a go The facts seem more or less in order I could dispute a few bits but the whole article is really badly written and needs serious rewriting by someone whos a good writer in English Ill make an attempt later but anyone else who wants a go is of course welcome 

In the distro list Ive attempted to avoid Linux vs GNULinux by sticking to the word distribution and only included one or the other when its part of the name or when GNU is actually optional does Linux from Scratch still tell you how to use BusyBox and uClibc for instance

Further work on this article is desperately needed and I mean a lot more than tweaks of hyphenation   1648 1 Jun 2004 UTC

Thank you for applying those gramatical revisions  I just added cooperation Regards UserNow3d

 Jimbo Wales on GNULinux as the correct naming convention 

I would like to offer my opinion The project to excise all references to GNULinux is deeply POV and wrong It should be reverted completely and totally as quickly as possible Virtually all references to Linux should be references to GNULinux I am certainly unaware of any community consensus which would support the draconian and absurd campaign that has been conducted against the correct naming conventionJimbo Wales talk 

  

Why is this article move protected so that it cant be given the correct name  said  done
