Hm  I see that the purging of original research from the Characteristics section some of which I contributed has resulted in the impression that Vance was mainly a mystery writer who also wrote some SF and fantasy

Way to go folks  If reporting facts about whats in the books is original research then Im not sure why we have a list of the titles since someone apparently had to research those  Etc
