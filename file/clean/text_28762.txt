Beware of Nigerian Media bias of selected news outlets 

I just want to inform editors to exercise extra caution when using information from some certain Nigerian media outlets The following underlisted sources are being sponsored by the major opposition party in Nigeria the All Progressive Congress Most of the articles written about the President on their site are filled with the negative conviction of the writers It will be better to use foreign sources like BBC CNN LA times etc for any controversial information on Jonathan It is general knowledge in Nigeria that they are indeed critical of the current regime Using this websites just because they are notable sources as the basis for adding controversial information will be a violation of BLP Regards

 The Punch The greatest and biggest of them all
 Sahara Reporters The most obvious antiJonathan source
 Premium Times
 TVC News
 Leadership Nigeria
 Daily Trust
