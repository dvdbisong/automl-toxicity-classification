   The template in question is  which is about as civil a way to oppose gay marriage as possible This is a silly an issue as say a Republican editor taking offense at someone using      clpo13talk 

I agree its one of the more civil ways you could express bigotted views but you are missing the point that there is no reason to be expressing the views unsolicited in the first place and all these little expressions add up and suddenly you wonder why LGBT are underrepresented on wikipedia or even more extremely women because there are even worse biases there Contrast with another box on his user page saying he is a bash scripter This kind of thing does not implcitily criticise a bunch of people for who they are and so while it could cause controversy in the sense that zsh or heck fish users like myself may think him to be wrong it does no damage it just adds character and would be daft to complain about You see the difference
