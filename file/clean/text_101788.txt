Fine I apologise

As to which of the two versions is better I dont like how the Library of Congress article is written and disagree it is highquality writing I see nothing wrong with the article narrating the events of battle its lack of perspective on whatever you mentioned Id appreciate simpler English here is easily mended if you take the time to do so that is Please improve the current article instead of reverting it to the other article which is quite unsatisfying
