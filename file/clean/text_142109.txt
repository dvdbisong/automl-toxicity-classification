terrorism again 

An editor has twice attempted to add a terrorist designation to the first sentence of the lead as a primary way of identifying the Weathermen  I have now twice moved the material down to the section of the lead where the designation as domestic terrorists is discussed  This is a charged issue arising during a campaign in which the Weathermen are at issue as a way of discrediting one of the candidates  Wikipedia has been a battleground on the issue of Weathermen being terrorists across a number of articles  Although it is notable that the FBI called them terrorists in 2004 three decades after the fact and their views are worth inclusion in my opinion the FBI is not definitive in assessing history  This is not the US state department list of terrorists or any official US designation  it is a history section on the FBI website
