Translation issues
In the original German was a sentence Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk der die Puppen aufnimmt sondern ein Plangkan eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden

I am changing this to simply  In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan a type of table with holes punched in its surface on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use 

I think but am not certain that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke roughly that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets If anyone with better German than me thinks Im wrong and there is something more substantial here please restore the appropriate phrase Thanks

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek normale Kopfgestalt durch einen damit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar Arme durch je ein Stab der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich  geschnitzte bemalte und bekleidete Figuren die an Fäden gezogen wurden Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen

Ive rendered this The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk allowing the head to swivel Arms were attached to a separate staff allowing hand motions carved painted and dressed figures manipulated via threads or strings painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans but that may not be quite right If you know better please correct the article and make a note here that youve done so   1803 1 Jun 2004 UTC

Your translation seems OK Geweihte could also mean horned which would make sense in the case of demons Sanctified as in blessed makes less sense in the context  1244 5 Jun 2004 UTC

Another tricky one WayangKlitikFiguren meist erheblich beschädigt sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer I havent even ventured a translation for this it has several words I dont properly know Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word as in gaudeamus igitur   1803 1 Jun 2004 UTC  This has now been satisfactorily rendered   0540 Jun 5 2004 UTC

Another problematic sentence Aus diesem Grunde haben WayangKlitikFiguren die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben Arme aus Leder I currently have this partially translated as On this basis the wayang klitik figures have die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben leather arms I know that durchstehen is to stand ones ground but I still cant fully translate the sentence   1817 1 Jun 2004 UTC  This has now been satisfactorily rendered   0540 Jun 5 2004 UTC

And another Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben The first part is From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara Im not at all clear on the latter part My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks but can just be pugnacious people   1946 1 Jun 2004 UTC
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks but Id consider that suspect since one cant tell from the original German Id like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct   0540 Jun 5 2004 UTC
 I translated it as I did because it explicitly says the boys with their X and not somthing like the two xlike boys  1244 5 Jun 2004 UTC

An interesting link Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang In stead a Plangkan permanent wooden table with holes to support the wooden puppets is used

 Hmm Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands That would really be a pain after so much work went into a translation Im not sure quite what to do with this   0230 Jun 6 2004 UTC

 Im moving the article 

I love the article but it is in the wrong place  It should be named just wayang as it is a good overview of all the different types of wayang  Wayang  meaning puppet is the term for ALL Indonesian puppets  Wayang Kulit is just one type of
