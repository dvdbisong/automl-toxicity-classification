Wow  while some of the information may be factual i believe the bias commentary can be without I am jordanian and have had my family serve in many branches of the military But please 
Since Israel was becoming increasingly the most potential source of threat to the Arab states  Egypt declared a state of emergency and started to concentrate its forces in Sinai desert Consequently Israel ordered the full mobilization of its forces on May 251967 As a result of such dramatic situation the Arab Jordan Army was placed under a maximum alert In addition to that Jordan signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt

 that section right there The As a result of such dramatic situation  you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed Even in King Husseins own book and through historical records its pretty clear jordan went to war not because of a threat of israel winning but a threat that egypt and syria would win sidelining jordan big time

At any rate i think it would be better not to context why the wars started etc Focus on battles etc Most of the israeli incursions were also due to Israels concept of if Palestinian guerrillas attack to hit back at the arab militaries instead
