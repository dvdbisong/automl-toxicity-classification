Thanks for bringing this to my attention  Jims not an admin so he asked me to investigate this  The thing is its against Wikipedia policy to block a user or an IP address based on the idea that they might vandalize again  This IP address is associated with a school which explains why theres a high incidence of vandalism coming from it  However there may be contributors there who make constructive edits and we dont want to discourage or preclude them from contributing  What we can do is to make sure that our vandalism fighting efforts are strong and enact a number of shortterm blocks if the problem worsens  Vandals cant destroy files all they can do is make a temporary mess that is fairly simple to fix  If youre interested in fighting vandalism you can read about it here and learn about reverting vandalism here  Happy editing
