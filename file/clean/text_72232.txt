Strongly opposed merge As I explained above these are completely different subjects and the fact that the green transport is not well developed does not justified the merger The key difference is that green transport is a conceptwording developed by the environmental groups while sustainable transport is a mainstream concept in transport engineering and economics and obviously they overlap as green transport is a subset of sustainable transport but some concepts are defined by the environmental ideology rather than pure economics and engineering and these not necessarily agree
