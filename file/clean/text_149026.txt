Trolling by Bogdan and Constantzeanu
Bulgar necropoles have been discovered on the following sites Topola Durankulak Dobrich region and Istria Obarshia Noua Izvorul Sultana in presentday Romania And this is according to a source from the 1960s perhaps many more have been found after that date Should I also remind you that the first Bulgarian capital Pliska lies around 50 km from the boundary of Southern Dobruja

As for the Romanian majority in northern Dobruja we have talked at length with you about this Bogdan and such a thing did not exist AT ALL until the beginning of the 20th century and even then the Romanians had ONLY a relative majority 

Third of all I want to ask what the hell does Cadrilater do in the category Historical Romanian Regions The fact that it was ruled for 22 years by Romania and subjected to intensive colonisation does not make it a historical Romanian region the category falls sorry
