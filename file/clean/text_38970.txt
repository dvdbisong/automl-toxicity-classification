Been a while 

Happy belated birthday Merry Christmas Happy New Year and Groundhog Day

Take a break from all the WP nannying Hope youre doing great  MIT

Take another look at December 2008s and last months archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end Shades of Extreme Home Makeover  etc

This may be the closest I get to remastering old films like they now have to do for BluRay Feels like it fun but tedious

Some of these archived portal pages Ive trundled through going back to Jan of 08 so far succumb to tableformatting bugs on my platform TigerSafari FF3 So I kludged the position of the calendars But these two months work fine No clue as to why they break Is there a documented bug This seems to be some kind of CSS error

The PortalCurrent eventsHow to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late so Im attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the fold Dont have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this though

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing hereinafter AOTW

January 2008 works okay on my plat

February 2008 broken so its kludged

March 2008 okay

April 2008 okay

May 2008 works okay International hols are an embarrassment why just May

June 2008 works OK

July 2008 breaks with prescribed table formatting so its kludged

August 2008 OK

September 2008 OK

October 2008 OK

November 2008 also breaks so its kludged Dont know whatll happen if we attempt to reconstruct  restore a local temporally speaking  sidebar

December 2008 Okay and complete with the important comment that its an archived section

January 2009 Also OK as above

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done and its as selfexplanatory as I can manage to make it Thanx again for all the great work on this design unjustly neglected

Now to wake up our 25yearold Yes its been a while
