JasonR 

Hey there

I wandered across your post to Ed Poors talk page regarding UserJasonRs access level  This may have already been answered but I dont see it here

JasonR was an employee of Bomis before Wikipedia took off and he did some programming work for Wikimedia and was granted rights for doing a few specific tasks in software management  This was before teh wiki had graphics or any sort of popularity   To my knowledge he no longer works for the foundation or Wikia

Happy editing to you  talk
