Your sig 

Im curious as to how youre signing off Are you doing  or are you typing it by hand Your signature should always be linked to your user page talk page or both just as a heads up 

Also whilst its always great to have new vandal fighters youve been one of the very rare people who go straight into full on vandalfighting straight from creating an account Its something that we dont tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well 

But besides that Im sure having one more vandal fighter regardless how new is never a bad thing for Wikipedia right So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user Im still learning the ropes myself and being adopted has been immensely helpful if only to know that theres people I can go to for help Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes and Im afraid youve been one of those whos had a bit of a rough time getting settled I hope it does get better for you and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that
