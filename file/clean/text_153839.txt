Hi Wally not sure if you are picking things up on my talk page so talking with you here

Thanks for your rapid response  Proper thanks given on my talk page where you left feedback

The User Astrotrain is still vandalising my work  To try and shake him off my tail I have given him notice that he is violating Trade Marks the word Astrotrain is a Trade Mark of Katara in Japan but that user still persists in attacking my work using that illegal user name  

I think agreement has been reached with other users by removing all personal links from my image pages pending a decision from Wikipedia image licencing specialists and you as a mediator even though I have not mentioned your user name  One user ALR has been very good in tidying up the presentation of one of my images after initally attacking me

But Astrotrain is just deleting my work anyway I do not know how to proceed with recommending the blocking of Astrotrain but that user is violating international law on the use of Trade Marks and possibly exposing Wikipedia to legal action from Kataras lawers Astrotrain needs to be blocked for legal reasons but it would probably also be useful for that user to go through the process of starting again That user has a documented history of destroying other peoples work and holding back the development of Wikipedia on several articles there is a need for that user to reevaluate its contribution to Wikipedia and personal agenda  I wish Astrotrain well with a new user name

Anyway It occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographers in the world manymany much more competent than me who would be willing to release their prized pictures to Wikipedia for free Wikipedia use only  Much of the world is lacking in education and information The worlds poorest only hope in the short term is technology leap eg skipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the Internet with Wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information But not making pictures and information available from the professionals ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information this will not help them And on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information  Photographers often appear an arrogant breed but deep down they are artists caring people  Perhaps Wikipedia should be calling on photographers around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and Wikipedia Hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful  Des
