I checked the opening theme song on the US DVD release with my copy of Teardrop they match More importantly I think that the closing theme is also by Massive Attack and is a song called Everywhen I have not been able to find one statement on this anywhere Can anyone help confirm this Everywhen is off of the 100th Window album
