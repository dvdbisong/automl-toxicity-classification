The main reason I was editing this page is because contributions by user Laveol are offensive to the Macedonians Lazar Kolisevski was a Macedonian from Republic of Macedonia
But still he does not deserver to have false information published under his English Wikipedia Page I have to add that Macedonian Wikipedia Page about Lazar Kolisevski is what the English Page should be edited
In general there are a lot of negation politics from the Macedonias neighboring countries Any of them would negate something about Macedonia country nation language culture history name and so on
The information from Laveol is in line with this negation policies of those countries in this case from Bulgaria Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda is mainly based on negating the Macedonians as a separate nation Macedonian as a separate language same about the history

Given the nonpopularity of Lazar Kolisevski in the modern times Laveol was able to edit the page and have that false information be viewable to Wikipedia users
This was over that top and I decided to take action about it  Delete the false information which is not only false but is offensive to Macedonians and Macedonian People

When you are Macedonian your parents are Macedonian Not Bulgarian or any other nationality
When you talk about this sensitive topics you cannot use books published in Bulgaria as most of them are Propagandistic working on the principles on 19th century Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and Expansionism

So the reason why that information by Laveol is deleted by me is that it is false and offensive to Macedonians
