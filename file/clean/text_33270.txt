The MoS on animate pronouns Say or Nay 

Im told that not all of my pings went through so this is to inform you that your name has been cited on a list of Wikieditors who hold the opinion that the MoS should not explicitly state that animate pronouns are standard for fictional characters  If this is not correct please feel free to remove or alter the entry
