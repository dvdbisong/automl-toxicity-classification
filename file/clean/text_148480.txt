One way of acheiving this is to view the page through a frame that is set at 800 pixels  It isnt going to be exactly the same as viewing the page at 800 by 600 but it will likely be close enough to be useful  Copy the following code and paste it into a file for instance wikihtml  Then load it in a browser and the left side of the screen should have the main page of Wikipedia in a frame which is 800 pixels wide   0957 4 Sep 2003 UTC
