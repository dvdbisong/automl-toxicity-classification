When there was a cantilevered section extending out to but not quite touching the Buckinghamshire pier how large was the gap An inch A handspan
I wish I knew  Im pretty sure Ive found every mention in the reference works at both Windsor and Maidenhead libraries but Im going down tomorrow to check the quotes so Ill have another search then  talk 
How can the bridge be a backdoor to Windsor Castle when the castle is some distance away from the crossing I can see how it would have been a convenient back door to the grounds the estate Home Park
Backdoor is I think direct from a source Makes sense for me as I understand the context in relation to the distance to London but I can see why a reader not familiar with the topography might think the castle was hard by the ferry  its actually about half a mile away Ive changed to backway  talk 
Okay thats my reviewI will watch this space for comments and the article for improvements Nice article superb images Too bad there isnt one of the Divided Bridge which shows its idiosyncrasies in greater detail
