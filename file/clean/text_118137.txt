Elizabeth BowlesLyon CC 

Hi

Not that I know what Im talking about but I was very confused to see the late Queen Mother listed as a CC under her Christian maiden name  She was once the Queen Consort of Canada and she was in any event married so I would expect her to be listed under her regnal name or if the Order of Canada has gone democratic at least as Elizabeth BowlesLyon Windsor odd as that sounds  As I say though Im an American so I am clueless  Could explain this to me please Thanks
