CC vs RCC

The points you make replete with the claims of injustice and oppression despite the fact that there are several Roman Catholic editors who support the current name or dont care about the issue one way or the other have all been made before as Archive 7 above will reveal in all its prolix glory  I invite you to read it if for nothing else the strange sense of deja vu it will likely inspire in you as it does in me Cheers 

This it the type of patronizing rhetoric Ive received from what I consider at this point outwardly AntiCatholic editors in this site  I know there is a good faith policy sure but the repeated disrespect and blatantly forward condescending attitude is just too obvious to conclude anything less  

I am aware you have supported the change of the article for the proper name Catholic Church in the past  I am determined to have our voice heard again and have this issue reviewed and hopefully repealed  However there is no way I can do this myself I need you help and anyone else that may assist us  by the way where the due process 

My most significant points for change are found in the one of my latest post as follows

 1Using a geographic description in addition to the title of a Church has to be one of the poorest excuses What is not understood is that regardless of additional descriptive properties Catholic Church IS the common title of the Petrine Church in the equivalent manner as Anglican Church is the common title of the Church of Englandregardless of any descriptive meanings of the words Catholic or Anglican If anything it proves how inappropriate it is to impose an extrinsic adjective upon an institution that is not titled in such a manner If that is allowed then where does it end Why not add to the Greek the Athenian Orthodox Church or say London Anglican Church since the symbolic head of the Anglican communion resides there

2Since Catholic Church is NOT a description but the title of the lone Church titled as such by far historically in the present and by the world at large it deserves to be title as such It is not ambiguous Anglicans do not say they are going to the Catholic Church do they Thus no point in pulling out the ambiguity alibi Also the article describes one Church it is not a comparative study of several churches no confusion to be entertained

3The personal ignorance of a Catholic which refers to himself as Roman Catholic is not an excuse to go by such a term Many of these same Catholics are the same ignorant Catholics that think Catholics of other rites are not real Catholics Thus ignorance is no reason if any a reason for proper education

4The listing of a Parish as Roman Catholic is reference to the Rite not the Church at largealbeit slang where Roman is interchanged for Latin just as Byzantine Catholic churches are frequently listed as Greek Catholic Church Since this article is discussing the Church at large and not the Rite the usage within the church by the listing excuse does not apply to this article

5The Church in the few instances where it does add the descriptive adjective Roman it is used in reference to its Petrine primacy and only when describing or comparing the Church with other schimatic churches  This fact is perfectly exemplified in Pope Pius XIIs encylical Humani Generis where he mearly mentions Roman Catholic Church as he speaks of churches not in  full communion Because in that entire encyclical Puis referrs to the Church as simply The Church vs RCC 46 times to 1

6Since this article is NOT from within the Church there is no way to confirm that it is not mentioned pejoratively thus the additional push to disregard this disrespectful term  Face it the only way to prove an articles description is not meant pejoratively is only if it comes from within the Church Wikipedia should not pretend that antiCatholicism does not exist

LastlyWikipedia is not a Protestant or Anglican outlet I mean really how many Protestants Anglicans or Orthodox refer to themselves as Catholic yet that article is presented from the nonCatholic POVas well as Catholicism Yet the Catholic is supposed to shut up and take it  fine Ill take that for the terms Catholic and Catholicism However we are not allowed the common title of our Church in the name of outlandish excuses instead the Catholic is supposed to swallow a term imposed by others outside the church AntiCatholicism as is the preferred connotation of those against the Petrine Church9 10 Where are the concessions coming from the nonCatholics

The injustice is truly preposterous 

Additionally and possibly the strongest point is historical What do you thin
