Let me have a bit of a look at where you two are going wrong in those discussions Ive got ten things Im doing now but seriously I can see two editors here who can get along easy enough I wonder if you be able to think of one thing that you can do to make Eddaidos editing life a bit easier and I know he can suggest one thing he can do to make yours easier just name one thing or a few if you like just so I know that you can think of ideas by yourselves each of you Because seriously this looks like pretty simple stuff here although I will have a look at it in a little while and see what I can spot if you two havent already named a few things    1613 23 Jul 2012 UTC
