I removed the tone tag after revising the article to what I feel is a very encyclopedic nonbiased point of view even though it only took the removal of a few words  Calling the bands music angular or abrasive is not something that needs citations as any music guidebook of the last 20 years will emphasize that this was one of the most angularabrasive bands ever formed  Thus I feel their style is a moot point and hardly needs to even be mentioned in this Wiki article Lineup changes and discographical details are the main point of emphasis with this band
