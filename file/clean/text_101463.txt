Aegean Macedonians vs Greek MacedoniansBulgarian Macedonians 

Hi Future

I want an explanation as to why the article Aegean Macedonians was forced into the article Slavicspeakers of Greek Macedonia while  Greek Macedonians and  Bulgarian Macedonians get to have their own article instead of being within the article Macedonia Greece and Blagoevgrad Province respectfully 

Aegean Macedonian is a subgroup just like Greek Macedonian or Bulgarian Macedonian is I believe Aegean Macedonian should have their own article if the other two subgroups are allowed too
