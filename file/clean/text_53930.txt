Well you ask good questions  But you dont seem to realize that Greece was far from neutral  it was squarely on the side of the British  Mind you I am glad they fought for the Allies but they paid a heavy price both during and especially after the war when I believe they suffered more casualties than suffered by the USA in the entire war  As for Calvocoressi et al the text speaks for itself  I guess one synthesis is as follows  Greece could have like I believe HÃ¡chas government in Czechoslovakia in 1939 authorized capitulation to the Germans and avoided the bloodshed of the Athens occupation and more so the Battle of Crete  But this is alternative history  And besides the Greek resistance was a moral boost for the allies even if you dont believe that as most neutral historians do not it delayed much if at all Germans invasion of Russia
