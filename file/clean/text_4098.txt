Thanks 

Hi David

Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at TalkDepoProvera And for reminding me its Guy Fawkes

I feel that I dont need to assure you that I will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re PfizerLaCroixBMD in the current disputebut just in case please be assured that I will not  It might actually be helpful to have other people than Mastcell and I making the argumentsperhaps more input should be solicited elsewhere as well if not enough editors contribute in a week or two weeks time

I will be slowtoresponddisengaged on the Depo talkpage in hopes of keeping things cool while still continuing to advance the discussion There is no hurry and deadline after all

I dont know if youve been following the discussion at Emergency Contraception but MastCells first post to Depo occurred less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of this exchange  It seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking but it also seems to me that he arrived at Depo already quite upsetconfrontational etc    Because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipie he is angry re EC page and following me to Depo and Dalkon Shield to express animosity I think it is better that the Depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors

Remember remember
