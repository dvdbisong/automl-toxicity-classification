Im glad youre reworking the text I had reverted you because you deleted a big chunk of content without any comment or explanation  As to the magazine if you can provide evidence that it actually has received plenty of statewide and national recognition in reliable sources hopefully please provide it and itll be taken into consideration  However the argument My article is more notable than other ones on here isnt given any weight see WPOTHERCRAPEXISTS at best its a reason to nominate those other articles for deletion not to keep yet another nonnotable subject  As to whether my research was hasty and presumptious sic the article stated that Outside Bozeman is often used as a tourism resource and is    a valuable local and tourist tool so I had some justification for thinking it a tourist tool  talk
