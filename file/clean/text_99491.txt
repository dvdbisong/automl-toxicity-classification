Divine Mind
I just checked in again to this carnival of ignorance and noticed the phrase Divine Mind is nowhere to be found in this Wikipedia article supposedly educating people about Christian Science I actually laughed But sure keep focusing on what that great theology scholar James Randi has to say Im a big fan of Randi but not as a scholar of religion or metaphysics
