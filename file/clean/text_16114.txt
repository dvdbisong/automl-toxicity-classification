James Shapiro
Thanks for your comment on the discussion page  Your version is better than what exists now but I still think the intent of the original article was and is gratuitous lawyer bashing  as you can see from WAS last comment   I personally think the guy looks pretty sleazy but  and a big but why is there such a desire to publicly excoriate him  Do we have articles on offensive doctor advertising or doctors that had their licenses suspended  Gee I can  give you the name of one  Only his license was not supsended it was revoked for far worse things than Shapiro was guilty of doing
