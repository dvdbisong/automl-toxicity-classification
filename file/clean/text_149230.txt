Im sorry you are unable to see the issue here  Then again you also have accused me of Undid edit consisting of unsourced info and a violation WPOR which is interesting given that edit was the removal rather than adding of any information  We have two editors my self and TFD who agree that the background section is needlessly long  I have already said I feel that any material prior to the WW2 section is unneeded and covered in the solid south article linked in both my edited version and the version you restored without proper justification edit war on your part  I feel the material prior to WW2 is not needed because other articles explain why the south was strongly Democratic prior to that time  The topic of the article only relates to the political make up of the area just before during and after the passage of national civil rights laws  Im would have thought that someone who had such strong opinions on this subjects neutrality dispute thread but not here odd that would understand such things
