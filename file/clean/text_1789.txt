Italian Renaissance as a featured article 

Before getting to the substance of my comment let me just thank you for all the work youve done for Wikipedia users like you are such an asset to the project I do have one minor critique to make though I noticed that you promoted Italian Renaissance to featured status but at the time I had an actionable and in my view appropriate objection Candidate page with my comments I objected to elevation to featured status on the grounds that there are stylistic issues in the article missing commas etc I went through the first half but havent had time to fix the second half At any rate you probably just didnt see my objection Ill do more to address it myself but the style isnt up to par for our rightly high standards for featured articles  talk
