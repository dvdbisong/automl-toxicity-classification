Appropriate names
  Excuse me Logolist but theres no purpose served by implying obliquely that the Germans of today have designs upon Wroclaw Szczecin Gdansk etc if thats what you intended above

Beyond that you should understand that all these points of view about exGerman places that are part of post1945 Poland have been made aired discussed contested and reiterated ad nauseum on Wiki during the past couple of years

My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time which should be explained where RELEVANT ie in any historical section This is especially true of DanzigGdansk given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945

Theres nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved Indeed it is linguistically revisionist in a sense to refer to Danzig for example as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans

Ive argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events  for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue
