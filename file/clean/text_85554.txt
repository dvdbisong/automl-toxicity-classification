Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start I dont blame you as its the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire Friends   
With this unappologetic response I think a longer ban is in order  
Heres the one vying for head of the censorship department lately Mind your own business a little more Irpin  
My dear friend As it has been ruled by the courts Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban Besides nothing could stop you from using one of your socks So you were not really censored Last but not least you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected I think Renata was too lenient But be sure that unless you change your behavior the next block will be permanent  

Insinuations and wishful thinking The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia almost I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign This is not Renatas fault but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case long overdue an institution you so vehemently attack counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users Soon you wont be fooling anyone any longer Irpin so watch it take my goodspirited advice
