IMO this users incivility was neither minor nor borderline WPBITE WPAGF etc Furthermore incivility is incivility regardless of its degree As you felt it necessary to issue a warning to me and in the interest of impartiality and maintaining a civil environment on Wikipedia I think it would be proper to issue a warning to this user Especially as this user instigated the incivility You otherwise send a message that Wikipedia is a oneway street and that preferential treatment is given to certain users Such a policy will no doubt lead to a breakdown of order and in rule enforcement Thank you for your ongoing assistance
