Kurt point 

Hey there to answer your concern without muddying up that candidates RfA Kurt is one of scores of people who weigh in at the RfA and there is no reason for him to be targeted as the butt of the jokes  These cracks at him have gotten out of hand which is why I said what I said  I can AGF that the candidate was not intentionally malicious which is why I put my vote where I originally wanted to based on that persons history Whether it is Kurt or anyone else I dont like seeing anyone being set aside as a standing joke Thats me  Ill gladly make a fool of myself which I do on a daily basis but I will never make a fool of someone else
