Thanks 

Many thanks for your work on the Black Hawk War of 1832 I am interested in this because a few years ago I took a field trip with some people to the various historical markers in southwest Wisconsin pertaining to the Black Hawk War The original markers would put up during President Franklin Roosevelts administrationthe New Deal The original markers had derogatory racist wording about the Native Americans The state of Wisconsin to its credit installed more contemporary markers but also kept the older markers Also I started articles about various people involved in the Black Hawk War who ended up getting elected to their state legislatures That was interesting Again my thanks
