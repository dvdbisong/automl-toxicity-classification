The reference included a direct quotation and UserLung salad had already quoted the relevant section over at TalkErich_von_DänikenGhostwritten Im not sure what your foster father line is about as the documentary simply has the narrator asserting that the book was rewritten by a former science fiction author The BFI link is clearly intended to give the reader further information about the documentary rather than being presented as the entire source
Either way the assertion that the book was heavily rewritten before publication was made in Ronald Storys book as Id already said at TalkErich_von_DänikenGhostwritten Ill restore it with a cite shortly
