Natalie said If Wikipedia had existed in 1750 its coverage of race would have reflected the racism of the day Why is that so hard to believe

Unfortunately its not hard to believe at all it is very obvious The point is just that it is incredibly depressing and it makes it even more so that people like you think that this is normal and this is the way Wikipedia should function Unless youre a racist you directly admit that according to your rules Wikipedia inevitably must be an unreliable information when it comes to certain things and you even defend this situation as if this is the way it ideally should be Its fascinating and just sad how blind you are to your insanity
