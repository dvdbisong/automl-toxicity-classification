In my opinion the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts stronger leads more references etc  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others Also I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols I have no problem with having a table for the Unofficial symbols sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables I know nothing about Governors lists but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists In the meantime just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three  Talk
