Re Your edits to The Doctors Daughter 

But Im not saying other images are wrongfully left alone Im saying other images are licensed in an identical way and no one has any issues with them I dont see how this image  fails nfc Where screenshots are an acceptable form of illustration for an article how could it be licensed any better And also the link you supplied concerns deletion debates and so is entirely irrelevant
