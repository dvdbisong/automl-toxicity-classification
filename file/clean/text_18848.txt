pjacobi Delete  one persons theory not in any way in contact with academic reserach Pjacobi  

My response Who cares how many people wrote it or whether it is in contact with academic reserach If you want to read about things that are in contact with academic reserach you should subscribe to academic journals Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia and the CTMU nowhere relies on contact with academic reserach to make its points Please lets keep our eyes on the ball here Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully

1 Most theories are written by one person others are free to utilize them or not in their own work later on down the line as they choose That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working which  inasmuch as we are after all talking about philosophy  may ultimately lead nowhere Indeed it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor

This leads us to

2 It makes no difference whether a theory is notable to academic researchers whether or not this is the case It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses Again citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor

You have voted to delete an informative wellverified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification In so doing you have let Wikipedia and its readership down Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future
