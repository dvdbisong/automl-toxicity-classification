Reverted recent changes 

I have removed the line Dada Bhagwan is recognized as a spiritual leader within Gujarat India The given reference  do not support this claim Also the person should be addressed by his name AM Patel and not with the honorific Dada Bhagwan in my opinion I request other editors to please comment here before making these changes again
