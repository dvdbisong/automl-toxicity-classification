Eupator is right the article is leading towards coverage of Turkic culture in Armenia and not specifically to Azeris Since it has a significant section which takes up close to half of the article on events prior to 1920 it is logical to think that it is just more than the Azeri population of Armenia Besides the Turkic population of Armenia took much more time than in Azerbaijan to feel Azerbaijani most still had ethnic feelings with the Turks of Turkey particularly those in the region of Kars It wasnt until Nakhichevans Turkic populations selfidentification that the Turkic people in Armenian followed

Armenia has a history of Turkmen Seljuk Tartar and various other Turkic people who have lived there I have difficulty understanding what point you are trying to make with this move Are the Turkic population other than modern Azerbaijani not human Why suppress their share of their ethnic history on that soil
