TFA  Dec 23rd 

Sorry to bother you on your talk page A few users have requested that the newly minted feature article Early life of Joseph Smith Jr be used on December 23rd the 200th anniversary of his birth  and worked hard to get it to feature status before that anniversary Since the 23rd is less than one week away I was wondering if you could make a decision whether you can swap it out for the current article slated to appear that day Fauna of Australia Thx in Adv
