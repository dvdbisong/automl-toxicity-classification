You know my friend Derek Wilkinson owns the 1st edition of Beauty  the Beast When I watched my copy I found out it was the 2nd edition  I thought it was the only edition ever made So 1 day when I went to his house I saw the trailer of Sleeping Beauty then it said the Special Previews bumper  thought to myself Wheres the Pinocchio trailer Did they cut it out Is this a 2nd version from 1993 My copy of BATB has that trailer I never saw the end of the 1st edition but once Marco on this website told me he owned it he told me that the Pinocchio trailer was still on there but it was at the end with the  now here are the 2 special previews from Walt Disney Home Video bumper  the 101 Dalmatians trailer after that Then I figured out thats how they originally made it  that my copy was the 2nd edition from 1993 when Pinocchio came out I saw on the Page of Fortunecity that it dtopped out in 1993 but I wasnt sure when in 1993 Then I found that my copy was from 1993 when Pinocchio came out so I was sure it dropped out when Aladdin came out  was sent back to the Disney Vault BTW since you told me that you saw the 2nd edition of Beauty  the Beast  you have a column on your user page called Videos Ive Seen you could list down you saw that tape Also you might be able to know this but if both editions of those tapes along with 101 Dalmatians  The Great Mouse Detective have an Aladdin trailer why doesnt the 1992 VHS of The Rescuers have an Aladdin trailer  2122
