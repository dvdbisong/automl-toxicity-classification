While your theories concerning the Akins coat of arms looking to you as if it is marshalled per pale might be plausible if there were an actual vertical division between the dexter and sinister side of the shield  there isnt  nor would there be as Thomas Akins was unmarried and died without issue which is why my greatgreatgreatgreat grandfather William Akins Thomas older brother was appointed administrator of Thomas estate by the court of Mecklenburg Co North Carolina  1785 September Session Ordered that Letters of Administration on the Estate of Thomas Akins Decd issue to William Akins who produces Hugh Parks as Security bound in 600 Administrators Sworn If Thomas had been married then his widow would have been one of his executors as was the case when my greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandfather Stephen McCorkle William Akins fatherinlaw died in five years later  Heirs Executors and Administrative Records of York Co SC  dated 19 Oct 1790 for Stephen McCorkle Know all once by these presence that we Ann McCorkle William McCorkle Archibald Barron  John Forbes of York County  State of S Carolina are held and firmly bound to William Burton Wm Miley Abraham Smith Justice of our County Court of York afore said in the present sum of Four hundred pounds lawful money of the state afore said for the true payment whereof we bind ourselves our Heir Executors  adminis firmly by their presents Sealed with our seals  dated this 19th day of October 1790 You also fail to take into consideration the fact that many particularly Irish coats of arms often have two charges placed on the field rather than a single charge or multiples of the same charge You can see a number of examples of two different charges being placed side by side or one on top of the other without any sort of per pale marshalling going on at all here coats of arms So no the Akins coat of arms is not marshalled per pale it is simply two charges placed side by side and the crest consists of two ravens twa corbies as is indicated by other examples of the Akins coat of arms found on earlier tombstones Alexander Akins gravestone Archibald Akins gravestone
