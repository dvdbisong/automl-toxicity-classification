Island says 160m including TEOM for Mariah so thats about it Music Box cant possibly have sold 23M outside the US This would mean 17M outside Europe and the US never happened in the history of music not even Thriller has such sales outside these two markets and it went 1 basically everywhere for months a lot more than can be said for Music Box It was a huge hit but not to that extent Adding all the markets in teh world apart from a tiny handful 0005 of teh world or so Music Box adds up to about 20M or so
