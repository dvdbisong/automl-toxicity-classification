ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 

Your personnal attacks seems to have no end now I am verbose what will be next that I am black and you dont like it 
After all your previously attacks nothing will surprised me

Am I writing in chineese or are you deliberatly misunderstanding and misinterpretating anything I write to avoid the subject at hand 
I have been stating many times that this was not a statement about personal research and I can see that you keep repeating the same accusations times and times again without ever taking a stand from where I left the last time nor taking into account any of my answers 
It make this discussion sterile and you are making of it a controversy that wasnt there on the first place so I will ask you to come down and to apply one of the basic rules on WIKI that stand that you musnt supposed the worse on the other users but the best and that you musnt bull any user away nor use racistic tones 
Concerning first hand experience you are doing nothing but it and all your verbose and empty criticism of me are based on your knowledge in a matter based on your personal experiences 
This apply to all the people who have contributed to this discussion and article without being deleeted they are all mormons 
On WIKI it is a rule that selfbiography are not to be written by the person it is about so when writing the biography or history of mormonism it shouldnt be done by mormons at least on ONE of the site about the subject in order to insure a minimum of objectivity on the matter 
You descriptions of the teaching are not points that I disagree about nor facts that I have denied anywhere in my contributions 
On the opposit and if you for ONCE took the pain to read what I write and not what you think I should write or what your big bag of prejudices hinder you to see you will realize how ridiculous all your attacks are 
I have clearly stated that there is an official side and an official teaching and that what is presented on most of the articles about the subject discribed in the big lines what is actually and factually teached inside the mormon church but that those topics are subject to changement that there is diversion from one interpretation to another as well as there is complete denial of what was previously teached and assertions being made who contradict what was first presented 
As I have enumerated some of it in my first contribution those things constitute some of the pillars of the churchs doctrine and are therefor very important and I therefor founded very singular that they were changed with time on this way 
Reread me from the beginning and you might see the light 
Concerning knights I WAS SIMPLY REFERING TO THE APPELATION AS SOLDIER OF CHRIST applying to all members 
Your allegations about hidden or secret knowledge has long been an allegation by AntiMormons No once have they ever proven that anything like that exists If you are talking about temple ordinances you would be wrong Just google Mormon temple and you will find a plethora of sites that provide exact quotes of everything that goes on in a Mormon temple It is hardly secret but it is sacred to LDS and we do not talk about iteven with other LDS Storm Rider citation 

Do you read what you write and do you have read what I wrote 
Here is a very clear exemple of what I am warning you not to do so systematically judge others on the basis of what you have been told and are well brain washed to judge as but from what you can actually see and hear that those others are trying to tell you 
I have absolutly nowhere in my contributions used the words hidden nor secret nor temple ordinances but you have the audacity to present those words as being directly taken from my own text so blinded you are of your own certitudes and prejudices I found incredible that you couldnt see it on your own 
I have extremely clearly stated many times and on several occasions and places and repeated myself to death on each of my answer to your attacks that the teaching I refer to are USUAL TEACHING FOUNDING PLACE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING

Is it now clear enough and can you take the pain to remove your veil and read what I actually write and not what you presume I should have say 
Thanks And hear yourself staging your speach with secrecy and by long been allegated Antimormons bouh those bad anti mormons have you been so brain washed and have you been assigned for so long to pursue the bad wiches that you cant actually see what is in front of your eyes

If I was you I will found it very worrying 
About polygamy you are wrong as already explained by one of your friend the number of wifes differ depending on the sources and he married them on
