After so much time i think we can finnaly understand this a blast from the past

This was not addressed You have three texts all AP from the end of January not the beginning of the war which mention in this context southern communities The phrasing they used is identical So you edit is referenced now It remains for me at least to see whether that formula employed by the Associated Press reflects precisely Israeli government or IDF statements of intent expressed when the assault began on Dec27 or whether it is retrospective Nishidani 
Because if we DO go back to the beginning of this conflictand we should when addressing the lead well find the following 
Dec 30  Israel attacks Gaza for the fourth day  httpwwwkbccokestoryaspID54699 from the BBC

On goalsaim  Israels defence chief earlier said his country was fighting a war to the bitter end against Hamas

On whether to use stated or not  Israel says its aim is to end the rocket attacks by Hamaslinked militants  of which there were reportedly more than 40 on Monday

Dec 27  Israels attack on Gaza kills hundreds  httpwwwcontracostatimescomcaliforniaci_11323391

On goals  The government said the openended campaign was aimed at stopping rocket attacks that have traumatized southern Israel

Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said late Saturday that the goal was to bring about a fundamental improvement in the security situation He added It could take some time

Stated  see above plus Israel warned it might go after Hamas leaders and militants kept pelting Israel with rockets  killing at least one Israeli and wounding six

Dec 30  Israel Assaults Hamas In Gaza  httpwwwhuffingtonpostcom20081227israellaunchesairstrik_n_153664html

On goals  Israels stated goal is to cripple Hamas ability to launch rockets at Israeli towns which means that a ground invasion is becoming more likely as it becomes clear that airstrikes alone cannot finish the job

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has declared allout war against Hamas

Stated Yes But infrastructure and since Hamas fire those rockets from civilians area not having military bases of their own police stations and houses in gaza are Hamas infrastructures

I recognized Nishidanis point as being that from the beginning there was ambiguity as to what this Israels attack was to bring Israel itself Now there was a target inside Gaza Hamas there is war but is war about what goals yes to some degree but most of those goals cant be archived until conquering has been archivedreIraq war AND Israels previous occupations of both Lebanon and Palestineso to cripple Gaza only Hamass infrastructure was the stated goal

At what point even Israels foreign minister was at odds with what the prime minister was stating as the goals for this operation

Needless to say then it would be a great disservice if we use Israels stated goals as of Jan 30

My humble suggestion is to leave it as The operation was aimed at Stated is a loaded term

There should be even more discussion on this BTW Cryptonio talk 

Plus Dec 30  ANALYSIS  Hamas is hoping for an IDF ground operation in Gaza  httphaaretzcomhasenspages1051024html

On goals  The operations goals as defined by the cabinet are creating a different longterm security situation in the south while bolstering Israels deterrence The IDF does not interpret this to mean a complete end to the rocket fire as it considers this impossible Rather its goal is to eliminate Hamas desire to attack Israel The bombing campaign has so far dealt a severe blow to Hamas

Fire in the hole Notice ref to as definedso they are defining what they are stating or viceversa plus IDF does not interpret whats been statedwhich of course was defined before it was stated which at the end they disregard what was stated for themperhaps rather just defined in order for them to interpret on their own because they found what was defined for them impossibleor what they interpreted as being defined to them Cryptonio talk
