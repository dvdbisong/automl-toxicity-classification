You apparently did not learn from being warned Im twenty years older than you and have probably seen a bit more in my life than you have Cf httpworldimprovernetENen8html  What do you think someone like you can teach me Have a look at your own selfdesciption in case youve forgotten

It is obvious to me that your reaction is gravely exaggerated thereby showing your bias You did not at all mention the kind of automatic reestablishing of the status quo ante mechanism of the other guy upon my editing attempt an apparently totally brainless procedure worthy of a hotline roboter

Suggestion Try to find out what your bias is owed to kid Apart from that I dont care what someone like you chooses to do or not to do
