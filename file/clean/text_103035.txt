718524127 has been making a lot of deletions that were added by a variety of other people  This user says he or she was born in St Louis but that isnt a decent qualification to make these determinations  Put a person up for discussion if you dont think they are famous  Do a little research and determine just how widespread knowledge of them is  Famous doesnt mean theyll be recognized on the street anywhere in the world but that a society or culture has recognized them for some reason  718524127 allowed scientists to remain on the list while deleting people who are in the pop culture scene  Give some reasons other than a single persons opinion before deleting a person
