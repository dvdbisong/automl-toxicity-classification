Eh Ill respond anyway Look  let me give it you straight You and I are not so different There are 24000000 Wikipedians on this site And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose of lifing the few exceptional people onto their shoulders You and me were exceptional However these Wikipedians the majority of them are liberal And they love to advance liberalprogressive causes but also find some Republicansconservatives amusing But the one thing they love more than a conservative politican is to see that conservative fail fall die trying In spite of everything this conservative has done for them such as Jesse Helms eventually they will hate you That is why I came to Wikipedia I came not only to fix some factual errors prevalent in some Wikipedia articles I also came to give a much more NPOV to articles involving conservatives where oftentimes bias and even some outandout factual distortions are prevalent Wikipedias time has come for fixing Like Constantinople or Rome before it this place has become a breeding ground for suffering bias and injustice It is for this reason Bbb23 Im asking you to unblock me Yes I will follow Wikipedias rules to the letter if you do As far as Im aware theres nothing in Wikipedias rules against removing bias from articles In fact WPNPOV encourages it Think about it Bbb23 I could accomplish a lot of good Adios
