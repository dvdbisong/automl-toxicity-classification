Free use image 

   I am the owner of an image that you have posted under free use guidelines  I do not have any issue with the use of the image however I wanted to point out that your statement that the subjects are dead is in error  Only one of the subjects in the image is deceased Jennifer Ertman the other two were friends of Jennifer  There is a separate photo of Elizabeth Pena the other murder victim on the original site that can also be used httpenwikipediaorgwikiFileErtmanPenamurdervictimsjpg
