Final Fantasy VII 
Klestrob44 I noticed that a few months ago you left a message on the TalkFinal Fantasy VII page regarding the explosion of nonplayable characters in the list on the FF7 page Theres currently an ongoing debate on that page about just that and at the moment its more or less restricted to myself and the person responsible I was wondering if youre still interested in the subject if youd want to drop on by and make your voice heard If not then just forget I bothered you    1314 Jun 22 2005 UTC
