What is interesting is how the rule applies to me only and not the 4 edits by more than one editor  So the rule only works when there is one editor and not a team of 2  That is an unfair way for 2 editors to team up on one editor  Clearly the rule is not just fair or good in this case of 2 editors versus one  Once again will over reason in this case  Bailey wins with his will and not by  giving any good argument of where the simple logical statement I made should go based on his wisdom
  

As for his claim that I blanked this out  Sure I did  By mistake  Sorry  I am glad I came back here to clarify what Baley is doing
