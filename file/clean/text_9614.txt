Christian Slaters family tree 

Regarding edits to the article on Christian Slater Oct 28 and 29 of 2009 I reversed your edit because

The edit by 16621612816 added mention of English and Irish descent but also truncated the long standing paragraph on the fact that Helen Slater is no blood relation to him  As you observed the paragraph made no sense after that hack job

In my opinion the original paragraph touched on a point of interest one that people might consult an encyclopedia to confirm or deny and offered verifiable facts that attest to the extistence of a point of confusion ie costarring in The Legend of Billie Jean and misinformation published on a DVD of Supergirl

Now you have reversed my reversal  I suspect youve done this in reaction to the mutilated version left by 16621612816  If you review the edit history between say Oct 26 and 29 and appreciate the original and long standing version of the paragraph I leave it to you to bring the article back to that state again as Im loathe to reverse the reversal of my reversal

Thanks for considering this

  

 Censored Comments on Scorcese
I would appreciate it if you didnt delete my comments on talk pages for personal reasons No editors were attacked and WPBLP is for ARTICLES NOT talk pages   
Your statement there is a contingent of editors that feel the need to hide the fact that there are actually famous people in Hollywood that support child rape is most certainly an attack upon a contingent of editors which include the ones who have acted against your campaign to accuse multiple persons of supporting child rape all the while ignoring the comments regarding reading the actual petition and trying to understand the actual difference between supporting Polanskis actions and protesting the manner in which he was arrested And for the record WPBLP most certainly covers talk pages See WPBLPNonarticle space which says Contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted and even permanently removed oversighted if especially problematic Both your claim about editors motivation and your statements against Scorcese are attacks Please try to contain your bad faith   

 You guys are delusional Im sorry that your celebrity hero worship blinds you to the fact that Roman Polanski raped a child and that is not okay Maybe you should stop watching so many movies and go outside and watch the sun shine Its not even worth it anymore Have fun guarding your precious Hollywood articles from anyone that you slightly disagree with   

No delusional is thinking that because someone disputes the manner in which you present your viewpoint it equates to being in favour of raping children and thats not the first time youve made that type of comment  Thats delusional  My disagreement with you is more than slight   If I notice you make any comments that go against WPBLP or that attack editors I will revert them but that is the only interraction I ever want to have with you   Please do not leave any further messages on my talk page and as long as you dont make any further inflammatory comments Ill have no reason to bother you
