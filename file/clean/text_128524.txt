Hmmyou mean Wikipedia is not a reliable source  damn Ill have to stop citing it in all my peerreviewed papers Ill be interested to see what happens to it in a AfD discussion As far as I am concerned the subject is notable in the New Zealand comics community and I think most people familiar with that community would agree  although now youve deleted most of the references so its not exactly on a level playing field for AfD I think we should reinstate them and let the punters decide After all likely to have done so is not very definitive Also its important to note that a lot of the material on comicsorgnz is sourced from elsewhere  the wiki is just a convenient place to store ephemera like newspaper articles links to TV  radio broadcasts and peer reviewed articles You know stuff that isnt self published but would otherwise get lost in the ether
