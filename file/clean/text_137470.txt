For the benefit of those who may be following this discussion Ill post my clarification from your talk page

Looking at the games in order of best sales theyd be VII X VIII IX X2 VI etc Obviously Sephiroth merits his own article and Seymour probably makes sense as well but out of the next titles Kujas got one while Ultimecia Kefka and Shuyin dont Given this and Kujas already substantial section on the list of FFIXs characters as well as the fact that describing IXs story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway sales figures aside he is the central conflict of the game really the same cant really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X in order for them to get proper coverage theyd have to get their own articles it seems to me like him having his own articles kind of unnecessary Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the games story and any discussion of the games story is going to largely be a discussion of him so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles Final Fantasy IX List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja

Hes certainly a notable villain though Im just saying that in light of the treatment of most of the other notable villains and given the already thorough treatment of Kujas role it seems somewhat unnecessary for him to have his own article

By the way I would say were always POV in how we decide such matters Deciding matters of inclusion is inherently going to be based on POV However that isnt a problem as policy for neutral point of view only applies to how informations presented not how its selected By necessity selecting information for inclusion is a halfPOVhalfNPOV matter based on notability POV and verifiability NPOV
