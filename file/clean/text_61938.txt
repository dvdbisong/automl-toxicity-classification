Hi Eiocos this edit where you placed the URL outside the link was the only one I meant to revert Placing the address of the link outside of the link is redundant
However it looks like my rollback undid all of your edits rather than just that one in particular I have reinstated your edits and made the correction I originally intended
Thank you for messaging me about this mistake hadley
