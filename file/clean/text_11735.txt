Gina Miller destroyed a 10 years long project in 10 minutes 

Hi

Since 1997 I was saving images and later when fotki became real I uploaded all my images saves to one domain However because of 1 complain they deleted all my work in a few seconds Fotki told me it was because of a complain but Gina emailed me that same week about that I refused to agree with her and then she attacked my work on fotki My work was freely available to hundreds of people I considered the images property of the web as here on wikipedia I always think that information should be free but now my work which took 10 years to accomplish disapeared in a few minutes from the non thought action of Gina Personally I feel it as very painful I hope Gina will regret her action
