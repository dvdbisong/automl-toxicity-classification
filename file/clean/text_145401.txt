When I say insecurity I mean as a result of the PRCs continued emphasis on liberating Taiwan and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in Beijing today could afford to be seen as having lost Taiwan the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC not withstanding Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II with Mao even being quoted in the 30s as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan Why Taiwan and not Mongolia Well politics basically the PRCs need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against western imperialism and CKSs Taipei regime CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20s or 30s to try to woo Soviet support but revoked it ha ha after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore Today CKS and Mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain
