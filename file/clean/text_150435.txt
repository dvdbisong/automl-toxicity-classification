Tsk tskyou deleted and basically shoved me aside without asking me in particular on the talk page what my opinion was on the article  If you have no true interest in an article let others defend on a proper basis  Running roughshod over other people is such a fine American way I guess youve acclimated to the American Dream now called the dumbing down of America by Wikipedia  How fitting that you should play this game and fulfill expectation of standards that sysops are held to these days  Dead on with analysis of this place by everybody I encounter whether educators coworkers family members news reports or clergy  You prove it with everything youve done or written that Ive thus far seen in your editorial history  Fine job of a selffulfilling prophecy if I ever knew of one  Defencive as always that old canard  It used to be that honourable people let no controversy be joined to their persons but held the upper ground from start to finish  Thank you for your help in improving Wikipedia
