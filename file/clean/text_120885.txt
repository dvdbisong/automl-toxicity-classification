The hallmark of a fraud rather than an alternative practitioner 

Since there is another burst of rehabilitation and reduction of the usefulness of WP as a reference work going on at present let me point this out  Alternative practitioners not uncommonly claim that conventional medicine and conventional doctors are all wrong or know nothing of higher things  What they dont do is claim to be qualified conventional doctors from Heidelberg  That takes him firmly over the boundary from someone who might be thought to be a quackish practitioner with some ideas that are not accepted conventionally for trivial reasons such as having been demonstrated to be wholly unfounded wrong and empirically ineffective  into the territory of the fraudster which he inhabited  Fraud is common and health fraud is a common variety of it and WPIS not a tool to confuse people abut whether demonstrated fraudsters might actually be as careful and sensible as any proper doctor from Heidelberg whether mit scars or sans Francisco  Got that
