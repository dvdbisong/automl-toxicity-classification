Hazel Eye Picture On The Right

The picture on the right hand side of the hazel eye section does not match the description of hazel eyes as it is blue with central heterochromia brown around the pupil The hazel eye description says nothing about hazel eyes being blue in any way so i trust this is a mistake that needs to be changed immediately i propose one of the following pictures be shown in its place as they match a golden light brown hazelnut colour
