What is biased about the article It accurately describes the Tajiks and there history I think your objection is from the statement that Tajiks are Persian Tell me what is the difference between the Tajik of Central Asia and the Persian of Iran Both people speak the same language have the same literary tradition same cultural habits and same history The only difference is political The difference is similar to that of the Germans In that the northern Germans are predominantely Protestant while the southern Germans are predominantly Catholic The Persians of Iran are predominantly Shie while the Persians of Central Asia are predominantly Sunni
