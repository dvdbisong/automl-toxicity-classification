George Zimmerman may have been described as a White Hispanic in the media but he does not identify himself as such His mother is of AmerindianBlack mixed background and his fathers white of German ancestry Yes he is white on the paternal side of his family but on his mothers side he is not Why a biracial man who identifies as such was described as white by so many media outlets really is beyond me but just because some media did describe him as such with arguably questionable motives this does not mean wikipedia should join them in  this absurdity
