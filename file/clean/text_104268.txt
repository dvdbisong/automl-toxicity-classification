WPEdit conflict  Regarding sources I stated The sources dont seem to indicate simply prepubescent And that is just as much a WPOR matter if there are no WPReliable sources out there supporting it But I agree that we should have sources in that section focusing on lolicon definitions That is all I stated with regard to sources And I was referring to the article No I am not taking definitions laying them up in this article and saying okay everything under  falls under lolicon because lolicon is this and it matches what such and such says The lead states in part The term lolicon is a portmanteau of the phrase Lolita complex it describes an attraction to underage girls an individual with such an attraction See how it uses the word underage and is backed to four different sources and yet you used the word prepubescent I see prepubescent supported by the third source but it does not state that lolicon solely focuses on prepubescents and if the other sources state prepubescent then why does the lead use the word underage the word underage is not synonymous with the word prepubescent 

And okay I ll go ahead and alert WikipediaWikiProject Anime and manga to this discussion now
