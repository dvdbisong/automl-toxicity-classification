 747 Table 

Hi how are you
On the table I created at Boeing 747 I intentionaly left the first 2 years before deliveries at zero to give a clear picture of when the fisrt plane was delivered to a customer Had I started with 1969 it might make it seem like some deliveries might have been missed But I started with 1967 and 1968 at zero to show a marked begining of 747s in service If you dont mind I like to put it back to Zero  
 Im good  Sure change that back  That makes sense  It looked like maybe the deliveries started 2 years behind schedule  
 Went ahead and changed the 1967 number back to 0  

 777300ER 

thanks 

People always make this range mistake Another guy asked me why a 777F has more fuel than 777200ER yet has 5000 km less range It took a while for him to get it
 Sure  If you can improve the wording there more please do so  

 787 

How is it going
On Boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs I believe we should remove all of them Have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 7873 7878 7879 and thats it We can even bring the 3way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart I believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this Why not add Ilyushin il96 here too then Or many other aircaft The 787 article is very very poorly done Its not an encyclopedic entry Its simply a collection of newsbits It has become a forum to bash the A350 or even the A380 As soon as a story comes out somebody writes a paragraph there I have been doing some updates and I want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes  
 Hey going OK here  I can see both sides on the comparison chart  2 planes one smaller and one larger for comparson is enough  Itd be OK to remove non787 planes since other airliner articles dont have them  The fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article I think  People spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all  Ill keep an eye on it and do what I can  Take it easy Bangabalunga   

 7478 Speed 

You are correct
It was 85 and 845 on Boeing last week I dont know when they changed it
I know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 7478 will have more drag than 747400 but I guess in order
to have bragging rights against the A380 they must be faster
I am sure airlines will still cruise at 0845 though in the Intercontinental just to be efficient
Take care  
 No problem  The 747 has had a cruise speed of Mach 085 for some time  Dont think theres not that much a difference there  Good catch on the upper deck 310 windows thing  I was confused before   

Hughes Helicopters
Some user slapped a notability tag on the Hughes Helicopters article I removed it to get his attention as some people dont read the talk pages and posted comments on the talk page also I dont know what his problem with the page is but it might be that its unsourced He just put the unreferenced tag up today so its not like noone wont know thats a problem Can you take a look and see what you think Thanks   
 Sure  Will do   

Inlet geometry
On FA18 Hornet you added the F16 as having variable inlet geometry I always understood that it was fixed on the F16 and I can have several printed sources on that Has that been changed on later F16s   
 I only reverted a change where the F4 replaced the F16 in this sentence The engine air intake of the Hornet is notable among its contemporaries for being fixed unlike the F14 F15 and F16 which have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air intakes  The F4 is from an earlier era  Please correct that if needed  Thanks  

OK I didnt check the earlier history I just wanted to ask first to find out why it there in case you had a reason and now I know Ill take it out THanks  Use
