I wish you had not done this A move is not justified on this basis the Bristol park has no article and even if it did this article would be the primary topic The article title is unique due to the apostrophe locations and thus per the naming policies no addition of Newcastle is required in the same way that Exeter and London are not added to the other similarly named articles I will reuqest an administrator fix this contested move as it needs a revert over a redirect now and if you still think it is ambiguous and needs moving you must follow the proper procedure and do it properly as a requested move
