Theories in science fiction Parallel universes resolution 

I think that the parallel universes resolution should not be put under the science fiction catagory There are current physics theories that suggest at least at a mathematical level the possibility of parallel universes One such theory is Stringtheory httpenwikipediaorgwikiString_theory

More accuretly it is Mtheory
Mtheory
A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within the 11dimensional extension of string theory known as Mtheory In Mtheory our universe and others are created by collisions between membranes in an 11dimensional space Unlike the universes in the quantum multiverse these universes can have completely different laws of physicsanything may be possible

This is also talked about in a PBS Nova special entitled The Elegant Universe

And those videos are full of scientists and professors from various established scientific communities
