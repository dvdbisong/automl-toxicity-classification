Palpatines Appearance
I know the what the official Star Wars databank says and it can still be left open to interpretation Just because the lightning caused his face to change doesnt mean it physically deformed his facial tissue I also dont care about what Pablo Hidalgo says as this is still a secondary source Rick McCallum said a few years back that Boba Fett was not going to be in Episode II and was he correct No The lightning burning his tissue theory doesnt make any sense in accordance to the behavior previously exhibited by Force Lightning interacting with the human body Weve seen Palpatine use equally powerful Force Lightning on Luke did that deform Luke No Dooku used Force Lightning on Anakin did that deform Anakin No Just because the lightning was deflected doesnt make its effects on the human body any different Seriously why do you think his Sith eyes appeared along with the changes Dont tell me the lightning caused those too youre smarter than that And does Force Lightning make your fingernails grow Please
