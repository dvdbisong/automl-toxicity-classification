Elected Oregon 

Hello fellow WikiProject Oregon folks and entities Thanks to those who helped out with improving Vera Katz and History of Oregon during the last Collaboration of the Week As you may have noticed we have changed the banners a bit but not our dedication to everything Oregon This week in honor of the political process we have Current Oregon Senate members  Current Oregon House members Hopefully by November we can have an article on every current member of the Oregon Legislature So feel free to turn a red link blue or expand an existing article Since it is an election year there should be plenty of newspaper stories Plus the state archives has this site that allows you to go back and see when they started serving and district info plus at a minimum show they were a state legislator from a WPRS And per WPBIO all state legislators are notable so no need to worry about AFD As always to opt out opt in or suggest future collaborative efforts click here
