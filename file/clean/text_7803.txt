Well I used to work up at the mall for a storewhich has since closed and I know all the inside dirt as to why nobody wants to bring any new business industry or stores here  I cant get into the specific detailsthats an entirely different topic but I can tell you that the entire mall has been a money loser for several years now  Cambridge Shopping Centers has placed it up for sale time and time again  Nobody wants it and I dont blame them  If Sears ever decides to pull out of there they might as shut the entire place down and bulldoze it because the land is worth more than the mall itself  Everything is going Northside anyway  Downtown Chatham has been a cesspool ever since the recession of the 90s and it never fully recovered  And the Capitol Theatre Give me a break  They might as well give up on that too  Its been what Over ten years now and after all the time and money that was pissed away on that thing we stil arent any closer to it being finished or having a final completion date  As far as Chatham as a city goes I have never seen so many unsavoury shady people in my life  Not everyone is like that I agree but yes it would seem as though Chatham does qualify as the welfare capitol on Ontario  Drugs unwed mothers crackheads dropouts second and third generation welfare families a plethora of health problems and well you get the pitcure  Is it any wonder why the younger crowd is leaving in droves I cant say that I blame them  The grass IS greener on the other side  Chathams prime was over a long time ago   Its London and points East that you want to be
