Actually I didnt delete any of the content it may have appeared that way because of the 2081 characters removed but that happened because I removed duplicated references I also removed uses of the  tag because using  is a much better option Also I did some other formatting edits like adding linebreaks after images When linebreaks are added or removed then it is sometimes hard to tell if  any textcontent has been edited or not I also removed the centering and bolding of image captions because its simply not standard here to style captions that way I dont really want to disrupt your work though let me know if you need anything else clarified or if you need any help
