Im also sorry that Ive had to put some more conspicuous tags on the article This is not so much a reflection on your work  I am absolutely convinced your father is notable but the claims sometimes promotional need to be sourced failing which they must be removed in particular the section on Methods Normally I would look for sources myself but as you are certainly best placed to do this perhaps you would put them on the article talk page and well insert them for you That said why is there no article on the German Wikipedia
