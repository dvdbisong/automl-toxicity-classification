Still stuck at work for an hour or so On the plus side there has been a betting pool at work to see how long before I got in trouble for some of my own stupidities Im out 5 

exhales Ill be the first to admit I crossed the line Firsfron is an admin I can solidly respect for never being full of shit I feel like blocks are an affair of honor  if you fuck up and you know you did and you did it anyway you have to do the time The statements I made were personal attacks  sadly depressingly they were also right and there are probably lots of people who feel the same way but who have enough sense not to say so onwiki I should apologize to some admins for not sticking them on the excellent and good list I aught to apologize to some of the admins on the bad list for posting my opinion Im bad at apologies I apologized to Kelly Martin and damn me that was hard for me to swallow because  no matter how I hated what she said she was right 

brightens Still youre my friend and I do appreciate what everyone has said here and on that RfC by CoolCat and on ANI This  however remains an excellent example of why I dont wanna be an admin Talk
