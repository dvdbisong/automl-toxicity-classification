LinksSelfPromotion 

Why do we allow a vandal to use a userpage as a mechanism for promoting his own sites Jason Gastrich has violated almost every Wikipedia policy in his short time here and just like WoW or The Communism Vandal does not deserve the benefit of a userpage Can an admin please blank his page or at least remove those links to his sites and products
