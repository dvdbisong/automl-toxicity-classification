Infobox changes 

I warned you before that you shouldnt be changing infoboxes on people Your changes to infoboxes such as the one you changed on Christina Aguilera are unconstructive Aguilera is not only a singer and record producer She is more than that If you continue to change infoboxes to what the person is not you will be reported to administrators and likely to get blocked
