I disagree that she edits without pushing her own POV if she desnt like content either because she doesnt understand it the significance of it or the rational for using it she deletes it see this talk page TalkWest Coastway LineDistances between stations part two for an example of her actions

If you personally dislike the award given to me please take it up with the person who awarded the barnstar and not myself thank you I also hope this overblown thing can pass on without too much hassel I have decided to apologies fro the edits whihc caused the instigation but it may just push people away from talking about their edits if they get such as hostile response to the cosy concensus 

My Reply
This discussion was started on your talk page please reply on your talk page and not elsewhere this is common decency as others might be following the debate there and not where ever  thus I will be copying your reply to me and this reply to your own talk page
Now to the questions you raise
I have no need to complain to who ever placed the award on your page as Im not concerned with their action but your own if the award had not been present I would still have raised your edit style on you talk page doing so is a way of informally pointing out to you and others that you might need to look at your action rather than making any complaint official
Now for the reason in my opinion you cause the decent you do Its because of your style not why you edit or indeed what you edit you think you are right and everyone else is wrong even when the consensus or the facts shows otherwise  you might not like the cozy consensus as you put it but in a democracy that is how it works if you dont like that simple fact of life Wikipedia is probably not for you Buy yourself some web space learn some HTMLPHP then you can publish The facts according to Lucymarie to your harts content  

 

Does it really matter where a debate takes place Also everybody has a right to hold a valid opinion here and each person does I also loath your comments about the facts according to Lucymarie bit as I could interprit that as you thinking you are allways right and I am allways wrong in your opionion I shall take it that as you are an older editor you and your life experience as some may put it would entitle you to that opinion I however disagree I Think we should all move on and I hope never to have the displeasure of running in to you again I shall stay well away from your beloved train articles and shall edit other parts of wikipedia and retain my opinions to myself hated meeting you 

Does it really matter where a debate takes place Of course it does if for no other reason that it keeps all the comments in one place it also means that people who might be monitoring what is being said for what ever reason knows that the discussion is continuing  if it goes quite on a talk page has the discussion finished or has it scooted off elsewhere
