I have to feel for this user as I have and had the same bullying pulled on me with the same article There seems to be a gang of them ad they user names are reported frequently around the external Internet that behave in this manner If you create a beginer edit they revert it usually with no edit history comment If you attempt to replace it figuring it was a vandal troll elsewhere and your edit was correct you get a nasty warning on your user talk page saying roughly you cant do that and you will get your butt kicked if you do it again If you persist in editing a few dozen other times eventually somebody will tell you about BRD so you try it You go to the talk page and post your opinion only to be told by some of the same bully team opinions dont matter here followed by more cold warnings about being a vandal or other policy du jour Next time one attempts to edit and supplies sources for statements by professional people only to be reverted with not a notable source or we dont use primary sources to contradict secondary sources If you attempt to complaint you get another editor giving you a ban on your talk page and telling you you violated one of the 4567 WP rules Sometimes you would attempt to expose or list some of the bias and how it doesnt appear to apply to these bully team members only to get banned again for WPBLP I didnt know article rules could apply  to editors personalities behing an imaginary tough edit name disguise Last time I attempted to disclose insults on my person and copied them to my talk page the nasty comments not only disappeared from mine and their pages but the edit histories vanished as well  I didnt know this was an option and appears quite deceptive as the wikipedia system seems to keep logs indefinitely Apparently not for the few dishonest members of the bully team I laid a complaint against one of this bully team and all I got was WPBoomerang threats and WPStale and WPBLP warnings from the offending bully I complained about I feel I am still suffereing from that as I get regularly visited by one of the same bully team who hacks up my user page until I complain and then I get banned for WPBLP or WP3RR because they coud detect I was thinking about reverting one more time Another good one is lack of collaboration on my own user talk page  My conclusion is that this bully team exist to attack IP editors on a fear and predjudice basis This seems to be the usual psychology on the Internet in forums and real life unfortunately People fear the newbie and the unknown attacking to rid themselves the unknown  Most of the protection mechanisms are not available to IP editrs and are unknown The more I educate myself on the ways of WP the more I realize they rent not applied to IPs equally I have been ridiculed so many times here I have toignore most of it now rant off LOL 99251114120
