Pictures 

I can see that there is some cind of edit war conserning pictures which shoud be featured on this article For example we have two pictures on NemanjiÄ‡ dynasty They are indeed important maybe the most important but they ruled for 200 years and Middle Ages lasted from the 5th century to the 15th century I added some other picture few days ago and now its simply gone
There is no need to be ignorant My suggestion is that we should talk here about it
