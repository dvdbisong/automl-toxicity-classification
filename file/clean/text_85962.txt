Please note that all I have done is replaced incorrect information restoring welldocumented information that someone replaced without citing sources and providing incorrect information Note that wiki commons has archival information with the deceased persons Jan Karskis  hand giving the date of birth primary source which I posted Moreover the two articles in Polish cited notes explain the problem with the birthdate controversy  Finally the executor of the estate Pawel Zalewski is no longer alive and the rights to the deceased legacy are with his closest relatives  Jan Karskis family niece and goddaughter Wieslawa Kozielewska Trzaska cited in my version gives the correct birthdate and she has legal rights over decisions involving her famous uncle  If you would like to receive a letter from her legal counsel about this issue please let me know where it ought to be sent It shall be done Note that in addition to the sources cited two official biographers Thomas Wood and Waldemar Piasecki use the date I cited as Jan Kozielewskis nom de guerre Jan Karskis birth date  I dont know what I ought to do to correct this error  Note that similar confusion occurred in the Polish version of wiki and after edit changes back and forth they were  persuaded by the articles cited that the correct version was the one I included  I appeal this decision to a higher editor  This is a a serious error since this year is the karski centennial and your wiki error is creating much confusion
