05460 yes little more than half a percent from 2003 to 2004 it will be equal to the EUs GDP The US econ did grow by more than that much in 2004 Also I dont consider the CIA to be a good source for this data They most likely did not gather it for themselves even if they did why trust them with the World Bank is a much more authoritative source for econ info but instead reaggregated someone elses data To me the World Bank is the authoritative source On their tables  they dont show the EU at all and only list the EMU at the very end of the data with other superregional groupings
