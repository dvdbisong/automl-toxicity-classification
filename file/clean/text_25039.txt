You claim I blame Poland for all of Germanys loss which I dont and then you go and blame Germany for all of Polands loss which is totally false

I only asked you if you blame Poland for all German losses I did not claim knowledge of you mine There are of course Soviet faults but in total is some 80 of Germans

You are a petty nationalist I would even say borderline racist who tries to skew everything to make Poland look like the victim of history

Call me as you want I call my self as patriot If Poland was victim of history Well much more then Germany more then Russia more then Belgium etc We were just between two major powers of Europe in the corridor flat territory where all goes back and forth This is the difference between Canada and Poland Its geographical location You should think about it

Poland is a nation that does not matter on the world stage GET OVER IT

No comments Do you love anything maybe you only love is dollar

dont keep trying to blame othersmake excuses for Polands failure you can try to blame GermansGermany for Polands misfortune

Do you mean forgot the blood which was bloodshed You do not know what you talking about It should be never forgotten just for the sake of future generations In Germany still Nazi party exists

but her own leaders did not act to Polands best interests in the situation and that is why what happened happened

What happened The II WW Anyway do you believe Canadian leaders doing good job It is only shallow impression because some economic prosperity

If Polands own rulers hadnt of weakened her before the partitions the partitions wouldnt of been successful end of story

Yes democratic countries are weak Poland was in some sense democratic country less then USA of that days
Possibly if you know the constitution 1791 was the second on the world just after USA Beside role of Solidarity in last century it indicates something Any way my impression is you know little about Europe history There a lot of small countries which participation is important

asking someone are you a Nazi implies that you think they are I dont know about in Poland but when we meet a new person in the English world we dont automatically ask them are you a Nazi

It was not automatically in the case of so many German arrogant It was only an example in conversation with you It was not a personal question You to often exaggerate

 and finally I dont care how or why Poland is suffering

That is bad You show many consideration how poorly German were treated expelled from Poland Now you show no respect to the death in concentration camps Just beautiful I could not expect anything more Now Are you Nazi

I asked for a reference and got it that is all that was needed not some lecture from a crusading nationalist who likes to dabble in historical revision but its more like historical denial

For sure I need not lecture from you how I should treat my fatherland Also I need not lecture how to treat German revisionism I am not revisionist I accept the present borders of Poland  I do not look for revision You do

The Potsdam agreement was not a binding agreement and it never gave the land to Poland it gave them temporary administration over the lands

It is you interpretation check the American British and other atlases Give me the temporary proof if you can

and using that administration they expelled and murdered millions of Germans

millions Do not be funny Murdered maybe accidentally a few it could happened because the post war disorder After the war what was German fault anyway Millions you are absolute arrogant where came from the number You will have to apologize I am sure In total was 3 millions how many death Such number you are perfect crazy in XIX century Trucks did kill 15 million Armenians and we know it and after WW II in center of Europe MILLIONS of Germans I have no words on you insolence You will apologize it in bold big font on first line of the discussion or I will publicize you all around the World
