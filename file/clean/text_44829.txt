Thanks for the headsup I cant believe I forgot to add the Johnson Bldg pics its one of the more unexpectedly bizarre structures Ive seen so far Which is saying something See if you can figure out why  Also fixed the list including linking to the correct Arcade Hotel  
I wish I couldve found the E R Meres Sponge Packing House but there was nothing likely looking at the address Im glad I decided to hit Ybor City on the way home Sunday which is where El Pasaje is Ybors a National Historic Landmark District and I can see why Ill have to go back there sometime to get pics of more of the buildings there And maybe party there I gather its the happening spot in Tampa like South Beach is in Miami
Once the weather cools off a bit more Ill be making more weekend roadtrips again Its the sorting thru and renaming and uploading thats the onerous part but one does what one must
