You know Ive mentioned this a couple of times already but Has no one noticed that I deleted this section and integrated its contents into Test Scores section  IMO it works much better this way and satisfies most peoples concerns  it that change sticks this conversation is moot

That being said mike the phrase the magnitude of the regression across varying degrees of relatedness isnt quite on the mark  What Jensen did was show that not only does the IQ gap exist in itself but that the populations regress towards the same differentiated means as found in the IQ gap  It basically reinforces the claim that the IQ gap is a real effect  now he and Nesbitt argue over whether that regression is better explained by genetic or environmental theories and in fact Jensens structural equation model suggests that both genetics and environment play a role but that issue has not been decided yet  Ludwigs2
