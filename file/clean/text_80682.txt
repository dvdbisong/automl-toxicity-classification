For Andrewa

1 12string is vernacular embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers the last people interested in logic or organology and later folk nomenclature never scholarly nomenclature The same holds for the BC Rich companys catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as the 10string guitar

2 Any instrument with at least one nonsingle string should use course for clarity by any serious musicologist

3 Intruments with 10 single strings should be termed 10stringed guitars rather than the 10string guitar because there is no one 10string guitar with the definitive article

4 I suggest you start a new article and title it 10stringed guitars under which you differentiate the various types under subheadings accordign to their number of courses The baroque guitar would fall under 5course the BC Rich instrument would fall under 6course 

5 I suggest a nonguitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string 

6 We must recognise that 12string guitar is an exception to and deviation from a wellestablished musicologicalorganological convention and not the rule according to which we should rewrite the terminology We should also recognise that the term 12string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians In contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one PAIR of strings as coursed not single strungstringed Now I am not suggesting renaming 12string guitars but it is a mistake and folly to try to oppose centuriesold scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and rewrite the terminology of organology
