Origins 

I think it should be pointed out in the article that Klezmer is influenced and heavily borrowed from Balkan and other music of that region of our planet 

If you were to watch an older Ukrainian or Moldovan or Bulgarian movie youd think the background music is Klezmer Incidentally like with so many other things Jewish  The Israeli national anthem isnt Jewish at all but an old Italian song if Im not mistaken with Hebrew lyrics Btw Hebrew is an artificially revived language Up until last century it was like Latin  a dead language used only in religion which needs to die too And then it was artificially resuscitated by Zionists Which is funny because the founders of teh modern state of Israel were atheists its a shame what they have done giving a bad name to all atheists
