Plot Question 

As anyone found any refernces to how the plot or story line for this show is supposed to work  How to they explain how 90 of humanity apx 63 billion people get wiped out in a couple of day within the whole of Earths biosphere being wreaked  It would be nice if someone could find stuff like that to add to the article to help make it better  How do they explain all of the military being killed while all the cities and towns still standing  That makes no sense  So perhaps some help here would be great
