World Youth Day vs World Youth Day 2008 

Does anyone think that a lot of this information could and should be reproduced on or transferred to the World Youth Day wiki page This is effectively the parent article yet contains no section on criticism IMHO there should be a single article on World Youth Day and World Youth Day 2008 should be a subsection of this article
