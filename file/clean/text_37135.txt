The TIGHARNikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16 1992 at the National Press Club in Washington
DC At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage Richard Gillespie executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery TIGHAR unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery is solved
Since early 1990 following the groups first excursion to Nikumaroro
a 35mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands about 2100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island
the national media had touted TIGHARs theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan
The evidence Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled Cats Paw Rubber Co
USA a small brass eyelet and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHARs highly publicized return there in
October 1991 These items elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case all came from Earhart or her Electra according to Gillespie
There may be conflicting opinions but there is no conflicting evidence
Gillespie said I submit that the case is solved Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor  a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th centurys greatest mysteries
Gillespie and Patricia R Thrasher TIGHARs husbandandwife
team theorize that through a navigational error Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide There they died of dehydration a short time later The plane
they said was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2000 feet of ocean
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a sixpage spread penned by
Gillespie who cites Navy pilot John Lambrechts July 9 1937 report
Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible on
Nikumaroro but repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants Gillespie called this report
hugely significant and tragically inadequate What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now We would have to search
Nikumaroro
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi of Fort Walton Beach Florida for the theorys origin
Using celestial tables Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2 1937 the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running Gillespie wrote in Life By flying
southeast along that line Noonan could be sure that even if he missed
Howland he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours Clearly it was the safest sanest course to follow I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island Nikumaroro
This supposition was convincing to some but Devine wasnt
impressed There is considerable information in Gillespies rendition that
can be faulted Devine writes One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro He presents Earharts last message
as We are on line 157337  We are running on line
Earhart never reached Howland Island Earhart never
saw Howland Island therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro Earharts authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca and recorded by Commander Thompson related
no reference point We are on line of position 157337 
We are running north and south Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii She was on a course a
compass course or line of position 157337 which terminates
on the island of Saipan1

Earhart was not adept at navigation and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane
If Noonan had not been incapacitated I assure you that he
one of the best airandsea navigators of that period would
have
