You can improve Wikipedia 

You have used your administrative privilege to squelch my assessment of the article and by extension Wikipedia in general  I suspect that you have some psychological issues and will probably delete this complaint of your heavyhandedness  Many Wikipedians consider your as a prime example bullying approach without adequate dialogue to dissatisfaction with Wikipedias quality to be enough cause to leave you in your selfassured myth of greatness  There may be no safe place to criticize Wikipedias flaws within the framework of Wikipedia if you have your way all the time so they will leave and moan about everything you doI suspect you enjoy this and will change with nobody so long as you get your way wiothout direct competition for prominence on the INTERNET  Its a major reason why many have invested in making new pedias  Its okaynobody expects you to live up to the model of sysophood established back in the day  Who really cares  Why am I wasting my time with you or having any concern for the state of Wikipedia these days  Its hopeless and thank you for confirming what everybody outside the Wikiverse knowsenough to stay far away from a failed utopian project  Thanks again  Depending on your response in the form of commentary or action it may offer additional credibility to the claims of the multitude who will not venture to Wikipedia for any reason  Feel free to cybersquat and claim this mountain yours to do with as you please and to hell with anybody elses thoughts
