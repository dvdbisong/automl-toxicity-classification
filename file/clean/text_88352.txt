Crown of Ptolemy 

Hi there Methychroma I just went and briefly looked over your draft of the Crown of Ptolemy article WPPJTF has been working towards and since theres such a large backlog on articles for review I wanted to give you some advice so it passes quickly and easily on the first try
You might want to remove the second references section
If you can find any other references and doublecheck that all your references meet  Wikipedias citation guidelines that would be really great Citing the short story itself could also be good  Easy Bib could help if you dont actually own a copy
The category 2015 short stories does not exist it could be an idea to remove that category from the draft very minor though Also make sure the page is categorized somehow under Rick Riordan Check out CategoryRick Riordan to see how similar articles have been done
See if you can get the plot section shortened at all and made more general so outsiders who do not know the series can understand it more easily
Put more wikilinks in the plot section  and make sure the page is welllinked to pages like The Kane ChroniclesMain characters and applicable Percy Jackson pages
See if you can get a picture of the cover uploaded and put into the article
There may also be a Rick Riordan interview or some such that could provide you with info to make a section about the storys production or some online reviews for reception Try Kirkus Common Sense Media and  here This is actually the most important suggestion I have because the notability that comes from a novels realworld reception is most important for an article under review

Im sure youve already done most of these things but I just wanted to help you catch anything you did miss Good luck and in case I forgot to say it looks really great
