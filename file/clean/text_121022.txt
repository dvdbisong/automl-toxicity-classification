Archiving
Im not going to add to the size of the already groaninglyhuge Wikipedia talkSpoiler but I have made my opinion on this known here Click this link to contribute while its still live  A reasonable archiving period and general agreement that older discussions can be revived would be beneficial   Inflicting huge page sizes on a discussion page even though the discussions are obviously not ongoing and are never revived after restoration is unacceptable Tony Sidaway
