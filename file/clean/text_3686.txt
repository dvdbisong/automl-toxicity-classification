No problem The only place I can think of for getting a dictionary the other way around would be an Aromanian organisation most likely in Romania maybe RoM or France If they have one it might be a paper copy Here  is some information on associations that I found  one of the Romanian ones has an email There would have to be some AromanianRomanianRomanianAromanian dictionaries in circulation considering the minority in Romania I have a MacedonianAromanianAromanianMacedonian one from Macedonia so you may indeed get your hands on a copy Take care Alex
