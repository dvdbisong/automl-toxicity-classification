Media

Yeah Id do something much like the Lethbridge list Also take a look at List of Greater Sudbury media particularly the Outofmarket radio subheading  we could do something similar for the Hot FM stations 

Id still go for a primarily citybycity treatment rather than regional media lists though because some cities Kenora for example just dont have long enough treatments on here to even really think about splitting their media sections out of the main article right now
