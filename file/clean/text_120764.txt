They were unarmed and there was no remote control for the bomb that had not been planted at the time they were shot however nobody knew that until afterwards and the ECHR report makes it clear that a radio device was anticipated  The verdict of the Gibraltar court was lawful killing and that remains so to say they were murdered is pushing a POV which is not factually correct Claiming ranks for terrorists in plain clothes is a debate Id rather not get into
