PS Will you be blocking  as well After all he called you an amateur   that must have stung pretty bad too  Or  who called you a stereotypical Wikipedian who makes a large amount of similar changes to pages despite having had no evidence of being previously interested in any of them not by name of course but then I didnt call you by name either  you just seemed to know it was you that I was referring to  funny isnt it Ritchie also mentioned that One of the reasons hit and run editors have gained prominence in the area of trivial formatting changes is that writing the encyclopaedia has become more difficult The quality of work has increased in some areas which makes it harder to contribute without good knowledge in the subject matter and sources Fiddling with the formatting seems to be a suitable alternative passtime That must really hurt You should definitely block  for that
