Thank you all well all improve the Wikipedia in 2007
Dear all Thanks for the warm wishes and all the emails that came in while I was at the New Years vacation

Now that I checked back for what has been going on in the last ten days while I was away the situation seems hopeful indeed The bunch of scandalous action inspired by the secretive plottings are still being discusses and widely condemned and I see I see a strong momentum of the community of the Wikipedia editors to finally put a decisive end to the secretive activity at the closed channels followed by the drastically insulting onwiki actions I am also hopeful that the new arbcom will act on the recent developments  

Happy New 2007 to all
