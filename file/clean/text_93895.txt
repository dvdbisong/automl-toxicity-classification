Nice class 

Hi there

I dont have a cite for the nice class concept To be frank the only place where I saw people reffering to that concept and also the very nice class concept was in a couple of Crelated Usenet groups where the concept is usually used as a general guideline for class creation 

On the other hand my only interest in objectoriented programming is purely recreational its a small hobby and therefore I feel that Im not in a position to make big academic statements on this subject

So thanks to your message I realized that not only the references to the subject are scarse but also that it isnt widelly used Therefore I believe that this article may be entitled to a original research label 

If you decide to mark the article for deletion it will be fine by me and I will not object 

Hope this helps   Talk
