I think the possibility of a corrupt core of admins is a problem worth asking candidates on So if anybody else posted this exact question there wouldnt be a problem with it Particularly I imagine if it were a well respected admin with an impeccable record positing it

I read each of the candidates statements and used that to judge if this question would be useful look at the time between asking the candidates questions Also look at the ignore all evidence question this occurred to me as I was going along and it must be regarded as a general behavioural question when linked to the 5 days question plus this shows it was not a spam question to all candidates I did pay attention to their statements

This is the question I posed to select candidates
What general concerns do you think are raised by the 5 days of silence from the communitys admins in this ANI Are there any other general concerns which arise from the ANI

Do these quotes

ameliorate add to or amplify concerns

Do you agree with the substance of the Jehochman quotes

If an essay WPIGNORE ALL THE EVIDENCE were written what concerns would be behind it and what could be done about them
If you can point me to another ANI where lies and deceit by two admins within an ANI were ignored by the other admins in attendance for somewhere close to 5 days then I will ask exactly the same question of those select candidates substituting this with that example Would that be acceptable

Have you seen such examples of systemic corruption before Or is this the only one Of course to answer that you would also have to answer can you say in all honesty that you think Ruslik did not lie in this ANI If you choose not to answer is it because you believe it is the moral thing to do or because of possible intimidation or repercussions on your good self
