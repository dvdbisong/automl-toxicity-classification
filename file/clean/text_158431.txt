What dont you understand Dreadster all the explanations discussing and EVENTUAL ruling is in the talk page of the European football records page do you not understand English There was countless weeks of arguing about the fairs cup then and it was finally agreed that it would be included saudi999 obviously hasnta a clue So i suggest you go back and read the talk page of the EUROPEAN FOOTBALL RECORDS page and see all the arguing and eventual ruling then revert it back WHY HAVE ANOTHER POLL WHEN IT WAS ALREADY DECIDED Now please revert Preceding unsigned comment added by Fadiga09 talk  contribs 

What I do understand is WikipediaCivility and how to communicate with other editors something you seem to be having difficulty with  so much so that you have been disruptive on the articles with your edit warring and also on the talk pages with your communications like the above  if you bother to communicate there at all This places you in the position being blocked so Id advise modifying your behavior before that happens
