I have always found your edits to be unbiased and measured so thank you for commenting on this topic  While I agree with you that the degree of Italian racism is mild when put next to societies where individuals were physically assaulted murdered etc for their race it is still a definitely real phenomenon which is why this article exists  Unfortunately the same WPPOV pushers you have come across in other articles found their way here due to one particular historic point of Italian racism a key example being the Lombroso discussion above  Anyall edits and opinions you can contribute here would be most appreciated
