Hi RetroS1mone Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido  its no problem at all especially when Im not around I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say I know he does have COI with the activist organisation but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI See WPCOI and also WikipediaSuggestions for COI compliance Me personally I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFSME pages or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested Oh and you are quite right about the forumshopping Guido if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page Ive commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content and for me that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles RetroS1mone speaking as an editor and not an admin I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like tendentious editor with strong COI POV The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records and if you say something incorrect you cant retract it It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content not the editors and then to say see talk if you want to go into more detail That way if you are wrong you can retract and apologise later For the record I think you are mostly right here though I would have phrased it more diplomatically but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page
