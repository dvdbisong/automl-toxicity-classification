No need to justify yourself 

Panda acted like a paltry gardenvariety bully and you were spoton in your first message Wording is everything and he chose the worst way to express himself But more importantly he paid more attention to my edit warring and to reasserting his authority than to the actions of a severely biased fellow wiki user who had used the Admin Noticeboard as a weapon rather than as an instrument

It is people like Panda or Lucy1994 who make Wikipedia such an unsatisfactory experience overall At least intellectually
