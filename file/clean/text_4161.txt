Diverse views means editors with a variety of perspectives and general outlooks Experienced means the person in question has been around for a while is very familiar with policy and has some experience with related topic areas With a bit more focus and structure with the involvement of a few experienced hands will make it much easier for uninvolved administrators to decipher whats going on and identify disruptive editors If I can further clarify or answer any other questions please let me know
