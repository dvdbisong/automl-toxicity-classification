Assessment 

From my quick skim there is a lot of helpful information here and it appears to be wellsourced  Therefore I gave it the highest rating without starting up any nomination processes Bclass It looks like it is definitely on the way toward Good Article status though you may wish to draw in more editors to provide a more diverse background of information  It appears that the majority of edits to this article have come from a select few editors  Not that that is necessarily a bad thing of course  Cheers
