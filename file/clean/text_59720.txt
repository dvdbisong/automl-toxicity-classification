The relationship between state and religion

Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in agunah One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses cooperation in the religious form of divorce see Agunah A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly but the capacity to remarry is also religious question Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children and for maintenance and property settlements Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  91 European Convention on Human Rights International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law Thus for example in Rhodesia the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz 1956 3 SA 522 SR held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts

Nevertheless the majority of Western states do to some extent make the secular courts response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed 

Canada

In Canada following consultation with all major religious groups the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 211 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse The legislature intended to
place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions
encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law and
maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access or monetary support 
This reflects a general strong response at a federal level to any elements of duress or undue influence within the civil law system
