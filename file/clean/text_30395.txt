My ability to translate chinese has no bearing on your credibility and objectivity Furthermore I have no loyalties to ROTK or Zhuge Liang I just want to see factual accuracy represented However I do wish for an expidited and peaceful resolution to this so I would propose that this argument be suspended indefinitely until a third party ie not you or me using another username contributes their knowledge Until then the factual accuracy sticker will suffice
