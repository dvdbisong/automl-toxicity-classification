Just to take two examples from the two sections above this one
 Wartime worries  reading what it actually says in the South Wales Police link provided gives a different picture to what is implied in this article The link suggests that the worries were in fact basically unfounded while this article implies the opposite Also the comments about Hitler by Saunders Lewis in 1936 are not put into context  many unionist UK politicians praised Hitler at this time Lloyd George for one I dont think that would be put in the article on the Liberal Party though 
 Seimon Glyn  he was a Plaid Cymru county councillor not an MP or AM I could easily find half a dozen antiWelsh comments by Labour county councillors but if I put them in the Labour Party article I doubt if they would last 10 minutes before being reverted

These are just two quick examples Surely all parties should be treated in the same way in these articles
