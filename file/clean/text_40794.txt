Wikipaedia has an article on Hone Harawira which might prove helpful in addressing this issue However such utility may be limited by that articles content on Hone Harawiras life as an activist focuses primarily on his participation in an assault on some engineering students
In 1979 Harawira was part of a group which confronted drunk University of Auckland engineering students who performed a parody of the Ka Mate haka with obscenities painted on their bodies The group containing Harawira assaulted them with baseball bats and hoses resulting in several broken bones
Regardless Hone Harawira is described as a Maori activist because his political activism has been almost exclusively on Maori political issues
