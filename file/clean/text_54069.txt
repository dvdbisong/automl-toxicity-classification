Just to note I am not extremely familiar with trains bridges engineering etc so I may have a few questions simply for my own personal understanding  I am reading and reviewing the article as if I were of the general dontknowspecifics population  As such it is taking me a bit longer to properly read and review but my review will still be posted in the early hours of tomorrow UTC Thank you for your patience  ЛееСуда
