 I disagree In Dutch language Holland is hardly ever used except for during Football matches and Nederland is always used Agreed when Dutch try to speak English they may use it but that does not mean this implies anything but incomplete mastery of the English language On the other hand the Dutch also use England for the whole of the UK both in Dutch Engeland as in English 
 There has been a short period in history only when Holland was official shorthand that was in the time of the Kingdom of Holland about 10 year in Napoleontic times but I think a vassal state created by a conquering army can hardly be an argument that there is a history of legitimate or formal shorthand   1642 11
