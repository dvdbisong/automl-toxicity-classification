regarding a suggested Wikipedia Regrets the Errors regarding the According to ____ format for information cited regarding mediation 

This most recent fantasy oriented post is emblematic of a large part of the reason why I requested this user be blocked In addition to generally incorrect and inappropriate edits to the NCCC article all around its pretty apparent that we are dealing with a fairly severe personality disorder You can start from square one with all of the patience and good faith that many of us have already extended and expended but weve tried that see discussion log and its utterly pointless Ill renew my call for a permanent user and IP range block LoverOfArt 

Coterminous youre right about one thing theres not a snowballs chance in hell of anything like that being published by this encyclopedia and certainly not under my signature Administrators are not empowered to make statements such as you suggest and I assure you that they are out of the norm for the project I encourage you for the final time to take advantage of the dispute resolution procedures beginning with mediation If you do not accept mediation other steps will have to be taken  Philippe  Talk 

Ugly Personal Attacks  You Approve

Good Morning Philippe The post above yours by LoverofArt is typical of his posts in my direction An ugly personal attack by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization  the National Civilian Community Corps  by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website
If your  Wikipedias best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person hoping to reason with himher while heshe continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes then your processes leave a great deal to be desired A responsible adult  a real Editor  should have interceded long ago

Heshe and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase According to ___ does not belong at Wikipedia As I read it there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims as if fact without reference to the source in its text eludes me It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement which is obviously not the case

I appreciate Wikipedias effort to provide freely accessible information to the public I am not impressed however by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like
A pretty sorry performance which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me
Pull LoverofArt out of this situation and I will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the NCCC site I refuse to have further dealings with himherCoterminous
