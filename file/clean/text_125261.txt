Various explanations 

The Law School is the only other major graduate school that belongs to UM so I added it to the intro with the Med School and Marine School

There is not enough content to split off to make into a separate article on the Business School just because the GA reviewer said that it could be split off

None of the links to the Miami Herald or Sun Sentinel articles actually point to the articles that they used to because theyve been kicked off to the archives

A whole paragraph dedicated to the strike is not necessary considering that there is a mention of the strike two paragraphs earlier

I dont know why the Iron Arrow paragraph was removed at all This just looks like more of Racepackets bias against its inclusion

The Split U is not a nonfree image it seems and its inclusion in the athletics section concerns the fact that it was originally just the athletic logo 竜龙
