Im happy to help but unfortunately I wont have time to deal with this in any detail for about 10 days  I agree that Stevecyberbunnys edits are inappropriate but I dont agree that theyre vandalism edits are only considered vandalism if an editor is attempting to harm the article  In this instance I think the editor believes he his correcting inaccuracies  In my opinion he is adding material not supported by reliable sources  While this is inappropriate its technically different from vandalism  For example if no reliable published source explicitly says Matt the Knife is as he put it in an earlier edit facing scrutiny or that his records have been challenged then the article shouldnt say those things either

First I have to ask you if you have any connection to the subject in the article because that will limit the ways in which can mitigate the problem  If you are affiliated with Matt the Knife in any way it is generally considered inappropriate for you to be editing the article  with some important exceptions Ill come to in a moment  Please have a look at Wikipedia Conflict of interest to see if it applies to you

If it does apply to you then you are entitled to revert vandalism  but please make sure youve thoroughly read the definition of vandalism  You are also entitled to remove anything defamatory or any negative unsourced or poorlysourced information please see WikipediaBiographies of living persons  If the editor persists in restoring material you consider inappropriate please raise the matter at the Biographies of living personsNoticeboard  If you post to this notice board make sure to declare your conflict of interest

If Wikipedia Conflict of interest does not apply to you you are free to rewrite the article as you please provided any material you add or change is anchored by inline citations from reliable sources  Please see Wikipedia Verifiability for more information  If you end up in a conflict with another editor over the article try to find common ground by starting a discussion on the articles talk page  If you are unable to resolve your conflict this way please see WikipediaDispute resolution

Feel free to keep me informed but I wont be able to respond until after March 23  ekrubrR
