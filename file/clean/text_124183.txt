Indeed there is no such rule at WPSTUB but do note the following sentence if the articles subject has no inherent notability it may be deleted or be merged into another relevant article I am of the opinion these articles have no inherent notability as per WPNOTE No it is not the astronomy projects say on what is notable it is WPNOTEs say on what is notable  However since we dont have an astronomy specific notability guideline similar to the WPBK or WPNF the astronomy project would do well to start one Also see WPGNG WPSTREETS and WPNOTDICDEF to get a better understanding of where Im coming from

Your advice is regarding the course of action to take for these articles is sound and I would also like to see editing occur in such a direction Regrettably I must confess that I am both too busy and too lazy to take charge Perhaps you could take the initiative or bring the issue to light to the astronomy project as I am unsure of where to go from here

Finally dont make laugh Do your worst with my IP No seriously do it Im waiting 701125239  

Though being taken more seriously is actually true I will make do without
