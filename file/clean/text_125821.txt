John Carter it is not your call or any other editor to decide which primary sources are relevant by putting conditions on which sources should be allowed and which should be excluded  The very act of doing that is analysis and interpretation  As I already pointed out below that is a clear violation of WPOR  It is up to the reliable secondary and tertiary sources to decide which primary sources are relevant  Your inability to see this simple point imho results from a type of confirmation bias
