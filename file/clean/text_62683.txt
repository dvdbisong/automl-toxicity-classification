I understand that a long thread like this can make you confused but as mentioned before the traditions were mentioned in passing as a reference to common Swedish culture today one of the ethnicity criteria The fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions very likely common within the whole Germanic area is merely interesting

As for my source I would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with Quoting one sentence from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Webbpage based on some junior civil servants webbeditors personal opinion is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a Swedish medical study which actually doesnt support your claim  

Selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality regardless of the source Besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of Swedish Finland you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text Det svenska området omfattar Nyland Åboland Åland och Österbotten Området är i stora drag oförändrat sedan 1100 och 1200talet då högmedeltidens stora bebyggelsevåg förde svenska nybyggare till de obebodda kusttrakterna i Finland The Swedish area incompasses Nyland Åboland Åland och Österbotten The area is generally unchanged since the great middleage migration that carried Swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of Finland

As for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of it concludes with Flyttning över den språkgränsen har förekommit i alla tider men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid Movement over the languageborder has taken place in all times but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time
