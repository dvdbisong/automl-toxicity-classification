You appear to be misunderstanding  Surely a section titled proposed benefits need only prove that the benefits have been proposed and have cogent arguments made at the reference  If there are counter arguments there is room on the page for them but I dont believe that anyone sensible denies that the benefits have been proposed and have a high degree of plausibility  The key point is that only evidence that they have been proposed is needed  You may wish to explain your accusation of refusal to show good faith but hopefully you see that it is inappropriate
