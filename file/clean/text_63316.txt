Hi Onel5969

I am referring to the draft article Suresh Prasad Sarbadhikari which has been rejected I understand that I need to make it formal avoid peacock terms which corresponds to words of praise Avoid superlatives keep just facts backed by evidence

I am 72 years old writing this on my maternal grandfather I am learning and will work on the text as directed however I need help from you on one aspect  please identify for me the citationreference numbers that are unacceptable 

Thanks very much
