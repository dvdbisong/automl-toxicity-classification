It seems to me to use a Christian metaphor that you cast the first stone  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians  If someone selfidentifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included  The category is for train enthusiasts not good train enthusiasts  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm   

Besides you are on a slippery slope  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180000 abortions happened last year  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian  But he never speaks out against abortion  He also took his country to war on false pretenses he deliberately told lies and in that war 20000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian   

But I do not want to use your argument  Nor do I think we should  But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Azizs soul  That you presumably another Christian react with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point  Create a category for saintly christians is a possibility although it would be horribly POV and maybe you should exclude Azis from that category
