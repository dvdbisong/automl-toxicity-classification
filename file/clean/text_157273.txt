I believe that all of the professional productions that ran continuously for 100 performances are already mentioned in the article unless there was one outside of the Englishspeaking world  Note that DOyly Carte played Pirates every year from 1893 to 1982 and did it usually once a week in repertory with other GS shows but sometimes twice a week or in more than one touring company thats between 5000 and 10000 performances over those years However there have been various productions by major opera companies regional theatre companies foreign theatre companies and repertory companies that should be mentioned at least briefly before the articles is nominated for FA  But as I said a couple of times already I dont have the time to research those right now and since Adam has nominated this article now I think it is up to him to do the research if we want to get this in before promotion to GA  As I also said he is working on a show that is starting tomorrow so he may be out of pocket for a week or two
