I dont like the term myself as it has both a nuetral meaning and a pejoritive one However we need to come up with a very good alternative as a term with both meanings can not be replaced because one is pejoritive Politically just doesnt do it so find something better I suggest Hamas does not recognize Israel as a sovereign state because it was formed by the forced emigration of the native Palestinian population Mention of the 1947 war specifically is not accurate as the forced immigration had already started before thenThe second half of that paragraph is also inaccurate as Hamas DOES NOT take the line that Islamic territory Waqf cannot be conceded For years they have stated they will recognise Israel within the 1967 borders if Israel recognises a Palestinian state You cannot refer to the Charter for Hamas policy as it is not enforced in its entirety   2208
