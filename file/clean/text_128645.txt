Thank you and salutations

I appreciate your comments and general support I am not trying to engage in any autobiography per se Rather I am trying to point wiki readersmembers of the public to where they may find additional information about important peopleorganizations in our archive which is open to everyone by appointment Sort of like an annotated bibliography or an additional reading note
