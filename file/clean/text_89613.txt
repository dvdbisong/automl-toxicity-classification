The tags placed on the page in question were done from my usual IP address and signed with the four tidals The page however would only display my IP address NOT my user name I tried several times to correct the signature but nothing I did would render a signature with my user name

I had no reason to use a sockpuppet to place the tags and even marked the insult removed as such so that no one could say I was trying to change history

If you compare the IP address and aimulti you will see they are the same and if you look at my edit history you will see I made several attempts to get the signature to display correctly

It seems there is some glitch on this dispute page and causes some signatures to disply as Ip addresses

That is NOT my fault

I DID NOTHING WRONG WHATSOEVER
