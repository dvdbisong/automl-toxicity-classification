Supposed influence on historical events 

I am entirely new to editing so I hope someone can guide me on this matter The claim The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link which isnt terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006 The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border or not Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel

Where does the PGO fit into this It stated the 5440 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudsons Bay Company was established with the company joining the government Theoretical control was extended by the PGO but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British I dont see this event holding great influence over both Canada and the United States About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced only America was the Cayuse War

So what should be done about this exactly The claim is simply far too bold to be considered historically accurate In the meantime I updated the link but it is worth repeating it doesnt validate the claim
