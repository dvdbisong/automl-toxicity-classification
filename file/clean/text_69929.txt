Tajik in response to your posting on my talk page I am not starting an edit war but you should not be editing the page when we are involved in an unresolved dispute on talk page Thats normal way this page has been operating to avoid edit wars and all consequences thereof Disputes are resolvable and the version currently there is not even final by me but by SaVakilian and supported by Ali Doostzadeh and few others Even Kiumars agrees with many points while you try to change very sensitive information without final decisions Lets get back to discussion and exercise some patience and understanding of opposite points just like most of us do
