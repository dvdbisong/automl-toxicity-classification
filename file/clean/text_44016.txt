Reply Dear you are right in your argument

The User   Walkietalkie is coming out with some crasy arguments that there is nothing even to discuss about the Terrorist category I dont know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence He is talking about commonsense I dont think so even he has an iota of that

If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State 

          Genocide 83

        TABDisappearances  Extra Judicial Killings
       TABRape  Murder of Eelam Tamil Women
        TABTorture of Eelam Tamils

       TABWar Crimes Sri Lanka  the Record Speaks

       Media  the Tamil Struggle Selective Reporting Disinformation  Murder of Journalists

TABSRI LANKA ACCUSED AT UNITED NATIONS

State Terrorism in Sri Lanka

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE

I couldnt understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTEs activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities

Composing the LTTE leaders annual speech or representing LTTE doesnt qualify him for the Terrorist Tag at all

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations

I dont know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him For what
Here anyone can comment independently and dragging a wikipedian to discuss with some other wikipedians is not acceptable Then he can come out with his opinions here
Others are also expert in the Sri Lankan Conflict here
