Clean up needed 

The list lacks of many Dukes specially the first Frankish ones and those that were also Dukes of Aquitaine Some linked Dukess dates and correlations are somewhat confuse and inconsistent with each other 

For those who can read Spanish a complementary source may be Au√±amendi Encyclopedia corresponding entry but it is a historical article not specifically focused in the Dukes but the Duchy and ending with the transformation of Vasconia into Gascony after Arnolds death 

I have just written the corresponding entry Duchy of Vasconia based on it and when checking I found some incongruencies specially with Counts of Vasconia a separate realm listed as Dukes and some dates
