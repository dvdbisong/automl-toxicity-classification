I have a question that might seem obvious to most people but has always confused me  Ok so a cocktail weapon is made with a bottle of gasoline and then a gas soaked rag stuffed into the opening of the bottle right  Since gas ignites so quickly wouldnt this design mean that the bomb will always explode in the hands of the user before they throw it much less hit the target  I mean gasoline fires spread extremely fast so it just seems to me that once you light the soaked rag the fire would hit the gas in the bottle in a second or less  Im sure its a simple answer but this has always seemed weird to me  rvinall
