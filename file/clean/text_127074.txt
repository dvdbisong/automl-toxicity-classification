Attachment to the First Canadian Army 

In the Normandy section it says The unit was attached to the First Canadian Army This may have been done to help in communication as the vast majority of Poles did not speak English when they arrived in UK from 1940 onwards

So does this mean that 1 they wanted the Poles subordinated to an Englishspeaking unit for command and control purposes rather than operating independently or that 2 there were sufficient numbers of Polishlanguage speakers in the Canadian Army to act as translators

Theres no reference linked to this assertion
