I personally am not opposed to websites being used as a source  though I like to see some discrimination regarding the likely reliability of the web site Thats irrelevant to the revert of mine you are talking about though  You cited information from your own website wwwbeckjordcom Now even the most simpleminded among us can immediately see that this poses a problem you are perfectly free to put whatever truth halftruth fiction or fantasy you care to on your own website at any time Therefore for you to try to use information from that site as a source in producing a neutral balanced encyclopedia article is quite out of the question

Who am I See my user page I choose to reveal more biographical info about myself than many here and I promise its all true If that isnt enough for you  if you have some need to know the true identity of those you interact with  then Wikipedia may not be an environment you will ever be happy in
