Hi there Thanks for your concern on the matter I can assure you this has little to nothing to do with mathematician vs physicist as you have proposed it instead has everything to do with Linas incompetence It is univerally acknowledged that a complex function SQUARED can be negative This is nothing new or exciting consider fx  i if you dont believe me The square modulus of a wavefunction is what the probability defined in the context of wavefunctions 

Remarkably someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics  indeed even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles  could make such a terrible fumble Without saying it for effect his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material literally my Complex Analysis book by Conway Graduate Texts in Mathematics series covers it in the first section and again literally my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class

Linas you are incompetent People tend to make errors at the periphery of their knowledge As it turns out the edge of your knowledge is day one in complex variables Please refrain from editing articles on quantum mechanics and mathematics You clearly do not know what you are talking about
