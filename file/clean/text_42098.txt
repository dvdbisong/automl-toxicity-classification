Truthfully my situation was what opened my eyes to how screwed up things were how often we get things wrong and how crappy editors are treated Before that I thought very highly of the processes I thought they worked and often supported them Know I know better because I have been through it Those who havent been through it do not know how often the tools get things wrong how often one bad admin decision can cause terrible harm to the pedia and how quickly the community turns on one of its own for petty and simple reasons without even taking the time to look into the situation
