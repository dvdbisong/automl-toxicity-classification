Well I think we agree to disagree this article is not easy to follow given the volume of text  Im aware of only one discussion prior to ours where are the others  As well objections were noted previously the article has grown significantly in size and is now unwieldy almost to the point of lacking utility  I am also not proposing headings for all ranks only the flag and officer ranks which are lengthy sections on their own  Lastly any user can collapse the TOC on their screen

As for the wikifying of realworld terms the article does not at all link to the articlesconcepts of rank and insignia that are described in the title and only weakly described after that  That is bad form and should be upfront not at the end

I acknowledge and appreciate your contributions to the article but resistance to changing it and your reversion can be perceived as exerting ownership over it  To that end I think it prudent to initiate a new discussion or RfC regarding these issues to enhance the article and we should be guided by the results of that  Thanks
