Please look at this what userjunglebrother has to say about all this I dont think Banigul and Nisarkand are same people Nisarkand told me he is 100 positive that Banigul is someone else Also please tell userkingturtle and usertajik not to revert the checkuser until investigation is completed tajik is creating socks and getting away with it he is also using annon IPs that start with 82 84 and 88 which are all located in the same exact location and editwarring with same exact POVs as usertajik Ie labelling everyone as ethnic tajik when they are not harshly degrading other ethnic groups always claiming that Afghanistan was created in late 1800s when that is untrue Look tajik claims to be Afghan but he is critizing everything about Afghanistan and its people with the most negative view you can image why are such people allowed to edit Wikipedia
