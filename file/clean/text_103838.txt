I understand your sentiment but conservatories universities or higher musical training centres are not the only places to learn standard notation All you need is someone who can read notation to teach you I understand some ppl may need to learn wo teacher but the facts still remain tab has limitations and those limitations are still there whether the students is poor or rich The section is about the comparision on the systems not a place for sentimental statement about how financial difficulties impact on students learning process 

In the Direct visual representation I saw in your edits that you tried to suggest TAB is a great alternative for ppl who learn guitar without teacher but since the original is already stating that tab is easier and quicker to interpret so your lengthily version that talks about musical journey and luxury seems drove the away from the main point and compromise articles readability 

For Fingering position section you removed the important opening sentense which is states the fundamental difference bw 2 systems

For instrumentspecific you removed the fact that almost all other musicians use standard notation thats why it helps communication if a guitarist also knows notation For inherent harmonic you remove the important fact about notation is codified

Again I appreciate your effort but your edits compromise the clarity and readability so I have no choice but the revert it
