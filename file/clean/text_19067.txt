Dear Neil The first summary is extremely helpful as it summarises the difficulty in accurately translating the term the entry is about It could be described as sarcastic The second summary is very sarcastic but still entirely appropriate to the edit questioning several extremely dubious statements made in a context where potential libel is an issue The third uses the word fuck but is nonetheless helpful as it replies to the question in the previous edit summary regarding a difficult to track down formatting bug I am prepared to acknowledge that the fourth edit summary represents an inappropriate venting of my feeling about people who use obscure words they do not understand in the place of simple words that they do
