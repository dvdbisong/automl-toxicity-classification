Thanks for your message  Let me tell you why I was alerted to your edit as potential vandalism  1 It was from an anon IP  Not a problem but since accounts on Wikipedia are free and simple to set up its easy to avoid this  2  There was no edit summary  When hunting vandalism blank edit summaries are an indicator of vandalism  Its always a good idea to add an edit summary to explain to other editors what youve edited and why you edited it  3  Adding your perspective or indeed any perspective without citation is generally frowned upon  All facts should be backed up by verifiable sources  Hope this explains why I reverted your edit  Feel free to get back to me on this or any other matter  Cheers and happy Christmas
