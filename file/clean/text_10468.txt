If I really had my way I would reorganize this page and every other Survivor page to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables and then a block with each episode detail in the case of Survivor youd have your episode summary exile reasoning and voted out reasoning all in the same block  The title quote would lead up that block  Now to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work so the easy way is to either do trivia adding length to page add to the episode summary eg Episode 1 Wow this is Survivor John blah blah blah or add to where they already are in the episode summary table  I think the latter would satisfy the gut feeling that they should be on there without affecting too much of the page  0619
