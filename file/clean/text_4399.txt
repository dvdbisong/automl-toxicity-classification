Here are some other hints and tips

 I would recommend that you get a username  You dont have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia but creating an account is quick free and nonintrusive requires no personal information and there are many benefits of having a username  If you edit without a username your IP address is used to identify you instead
 When using talk pages please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes  This will automatically produce your username or IP address and the date

If you have any questions check out WikipediaWhere to ask a question ask me on  or type  helpme  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible I will answer your questions as far as I can  Again welcome and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian
