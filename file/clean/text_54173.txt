I dont mean books by the way which contain hundreds of pages but any concise bio  
I looked through several bios on bookrag and none some of which were pretty lengthy mentioned Falk Its off topic and additionally he doesnt even have an article  

Well Im not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordans career but in any case I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article as I look at the Jordan article again it even says in the second sentence that he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation since it was Falk who did the marketing he probably deserves a link there  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstans book Playing for Keeps Michael Jordan and the World He Made which has about 10 pages on Falk as well as a ton of online articles I found  Cheers   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section Media figure and business interests  Falk is probably too offtopic to put him in the opening section but I think hes important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordans role as a media figure since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordans image  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago Michael  Juanitas split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media

Im wondering because the first Ive heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever   
Five years ago he was still in the NBA so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him For the most part Jordan isnt under the lime light anymore so it doesnt have much coverage  
It was announced in the press when it happened But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later

Nick Names
I dont believe the Nickname Superman is valid in the case of MJ Yes he was called Superman Pippen was called Batman and Rodman Rodman for a brief time But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA ie Dwyane Wade LeBron James and especially Shaq Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball what were Jordans nicknames they would say Air or Air Jordan and throw in the acronyms MJ Jordan has had plenty of nicknames but we dont list every single Nickname only the most identifiable Thats why his NBAcom Historical Bio only lists Air Jordan as his nickname I propose mutual consensus on the issue before more users begin to add obsessive Wpfancruft to the article Feel free to comment  
Agree Superman is not a common nickname for him At all It gets used all the time for athletes Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman its not worth inclusion 
Whosoever includes whatsoever nick should prov
