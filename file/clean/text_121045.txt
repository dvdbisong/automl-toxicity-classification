Even if the killers were at the Bash its not relevant  The shooting didnt happen at the Bash so is not linked other than the fact that the victim was there  That is not relevant  The victim has probably been on the London Eye he may have even been to Tescos  He may have been followed from the garage where hi filled his bike  But we dont see it mentioned on the Tesco Esso or what ever garage or any other article  As for the organisers comment that doesnt link the murder to the Bash either  If the victim had fallen off his bike and died the organiser would have also mentioned that but that would not be linked to the Bash  The fact is that it did not happen at the Bash and should not be included in the article Alcapone69
