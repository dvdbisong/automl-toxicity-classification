Fortress Dickinson declared under siege 

A siege mentality has gripped the headquarters at Fortress Dickinson security forces have been mobilized and some officers are calling for implementation of the dreaded block maneuver A bemused Miss Dickinson has been placed under house arrest by the authorities  for her own protection

A small edit In the Reception section formerly Dickinson and Her Critics Susanne Juhasz is paraphrased as offering essays from a female perspective from her book Feminist Critics Read Emily Dickinson Historically speaking I wasnt aware there was a female outlook on any matter Ive never doubted there was a feminist perspective however 

If a female pointofview has been established as biologically  or socially  predetermined kindly provide the scientific evidence for this phenomenon Until then Ive changed the entry to a feminist perspective
