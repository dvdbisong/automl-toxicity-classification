Ugh no I forgot about all that stuff on Daniel Brandts page I sincerely apologize to Tarc for that I registered on Wikipediocracy a few days ago out of curiosity I think it was mentioned somewhere among the Manning furore and ran into some of Tarcs posts on there he mentioned me at one point so I Googled his name because I really didnt like the idea of him digging into me offsite on public forums Obviously I found Brandts page but I was just looking for forum posts and the like I meant to just link to Tarcs Wikipedia Review posts Somehow I forgot to actually do that
