Deeply and honestly appreciated but as they say over at RFA too soon  Ive only got 6 months including a month with a staggering 1 edit under my belt and not quite 2k edits yet  Give me another month to put another 1k1500 on that Ive got a lot planned for January around here and I think I might find myself ready to reconsider  In any case thank you very much for the offer   

Okay glad youre cognizant of the editcountitis zeitgeist  I believe I could argue out of your low editcount compared to the average RFA candidate but if youre going for a clean unanimous RFA then more experience would help  You have a standing offer of nomination from me  Cheers  talk 20061227 1233Z
