Found it capacity to conduct foreign relations But its not the problem criteria for SoP  for SoP the problem criteria is the control of populated territory eg ability of the SoP government to enforce SoP laws there For example on p1011 of the source has a governmenthave a legislative bodyhave a judicaryhave an executive which carries out the laws and has at its disposal a considerable force responsive to its will  in the case of SoP the territory it claims regardless of undefined borders is under Israel occupationcontrol All other criteria are more or less satisfied  PLOEC is SoP provisional government in exile SoP has established diplomatic relations with many other states SoP has diplomatic recognition by many other states SoP accepts the membership obligations and has submitted membership application The rest of the criteria depend on the judgment of UNSC and UNGA  whether SoP is peace loving whether SoP is able and willing to carry out the membership obligations Even if its deemed peace loving and willing to carry out the obligations the problem criteria is whether its really a state because it doesnt have control over populated territory and the related whether its able to carry out the obligations because a state needs control over populated territory otherwise it functions only in the diplomatic realm as a governmentinexile and doesnt have the ability to do anything on the ground Of course if the majority of all UNSC permanent members and 23rds of the UN members want  for political reasons  they can grant membership to a GiE turn a blind eye to the lack of territorial control or resort to some reasoning that its able to comply and only the foreign occupation prevents it but that occupation is declared illegal by this and that UNSC and ICJ acts so they wont take it into account etc
Do you insist on adding such ORSYN unsourced analysis Unfortunately we dont have the UNSC 2011 report that maybe deals with those issues
