Shell the main page of RfC does not say anything about RfCs being the place to appeal administrators abuse Instead WPBLOCK does say it is ANI where it belongs No mention of RFC 
Personally I am very sad that you insist in defending your wrong decission when it does so clearly breaks the rules You have not even defended your decission at least with minimal coherence nor has done any other useradmin 
I also find very sad that no other administrator has dared to intervene even when the case is so clearly a policy violation I am offering an exit in good terms but as wikipedian I cant but follow the correct procedures outlined in the relevant policy pages and I hope that you do the same because as administrator you must abide to policy as much or even more than the common user
I am getting more and more worried at the apparent arbitrarity displayed and what seems a fear of retaliation felt by some administrators As compromised wikipedian I cant but fight that with the means that policy allows Its not just my pride my feelings or anything of the like it is Wikipedia and Wikipedias pillars what are at the stake
Really sorry we are at this stage really I used to have a high esteem of administrators and Wikipedia community rule and I still hope this faith in Wikipedia will be restored maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe in a few years I have patience and perseverance
