I am also wondering why the redwood forests of the northern California and Southern Oregon coastal areas are not included somewhere The redwood is specifically adapted to capture water from fog and my understanding is that this is the major source of water for the whole ecosystem Maybe there should be another talk category besides Size to discuss which forests should be included  maybe Locations I dont know enough about editing in Wikipedia to do this myself
