European Court of Human Rights ECHR Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article
On 17 December 2013 the case Perinçek v Switzerland application no 2751008 European Court of Human Rights ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide Perinçek said Armenian genocide is an international lie ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçeks right of freedom of expression Article 10 ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict 
a In November 2007 The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence 
b In February 2012 the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research 
c The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that laws that penalized the expression of opinions about historical facts were incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights imposed on States parties  and that the Covenant did not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past eventsECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide Perinçek said Armenian genocide is an international lie

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey
However Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached 212174383
