I appreciate the advice and I certainly am not planning on ding any sort of fighting but I do not promise not to engage in discussion nor do I promise only to Support a bad decision when I think an Oppose is needed such as the case of HJ getting access to the ability to invasively look into the editing history of any account they feel like whenever they feel like I really cant say specifically which articles I plan to edit but I have a degree in biology and will probably contribute to that area a fair bit and I also have an interest in military history so I will probably also contribute to that area If you want specific examples the Lists of Iraq War operations is a mess and need a ton of work there are a lot of generals missing and a lot of ships If you have any suggestions I am open to those as well96255237170
