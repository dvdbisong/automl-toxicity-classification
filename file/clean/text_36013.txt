Please give me a link to the defined list of NICs I find this definition very dubious since I dont think that any of the countries mentioned in the article qualifies as fully industrialized maybe only China India and Brazil if were to judge by industrial capacity and overall economic importance
I would like to see links to a proper page that explains the meaning of this term and the criteria for inclusion Economics is full of buzzwords like this one
