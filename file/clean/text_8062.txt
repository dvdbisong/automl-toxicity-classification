WPAN3UserGeoeg reported by Userdicklyon Result Both blocked for 6 hours dicklyon and Geoeg have been disagreeing about an article where WPCOI is a concern Since dicklyon reported Geoeg for 3RR heshe is focusing negative attention on Geoeg Why is this not harassment
WPANISPA Milto LOL pia pointed out a concern about a WPSPA editor also focusing negative attention on them Why is this not harassment
WPCOINSPAs and socks pushing POV PR and advertising on the Chapman_University_School_of_Law Page This also focuses negative attention not totally unlike what I said Justanother has done Why is this not harassment

You seem to buy into Bishonens belief that I am out to get Justanother and thereby assume anything I bring up must be part of that campaign You are wrong in this case he was being disruptive while other editors were genuinely trying to resolve a dispute If this isnt being disruptive all that needs to be done is give a brief explanation why answers like this are acceptable
QUsing reliable sources should this article have a section discussing Hubbards personality  
ARephrase Should a onesided POV analysis of Hubbards personality based on a small number of critical sources and bordering on WPOR synthesis be posted in the article as a work in progress or should a balanced NPOV and nonOR piece be developed in a sandbox by interested parties from all sides of the issue Which one benefits the project There that is a more accurate statement of the issue  

Please put your assumptions about what you think Im doing and ask yourself if the arbcom meant to give Justanother a free pass from having to abide by any rules that I happen to point out For crying out loud by your logic I couldnt report ANY violation of policy by him whether its valid or not Does that really make sense to you
