Perspective 
Carl Berstein sp said something last night on The Daily Show that struck me as appropriate here  Im going from flawed memory  The problem is that were spending more energy defending political ideology than we are dealing with Terrorism  Ive noticed that since recent events were not talking TO each other but AT each other  Please lets focus on the article not our own views and motivations  Bright Blessings
