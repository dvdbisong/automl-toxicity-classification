Dont Bother Unblocking Me  

Hi   I think Im going to give wikipedia a miss This ludicrous block was the last straw Im leaving after several years of tireless editing and trying to make embarressing Sikh related and India related articles more encyclopaedic The SikhIndian trolls halfwits and fanatics have won and the intellectuals have lost Keep up the good job James in blocking decent consciencious editors and allow the half wits to run riot on wikipedia Thanks and good bye Good bye especially to Dianna and other Indian editors I have worked with here Thanks
