Incidentally on p 48 Alan says that another of the jurors at the Brincknell inquest was the subsequently more famous Ralph or Raphael Holinshed Cecils protege  Again trying to impugn the jurys finding by claiming the jury was packed with Oxfords supporters Alan is in error  If you go to the document itself on my webpage KB 9169 Part 1 13 my transcript taken from Alans own transcript shows that the jurors name is given in Latin as Randolphi Holynshedd and Randolphi is not Latin for either Ralph or Raphael  Alan knew full well that the jurors name was not Ralph or Raphael Holinshed since Alan himself transcribed the report of the coroners inquest  Ive now ordered a copy of the original document from the National Archives to check against Alans transcript  Nina Green
