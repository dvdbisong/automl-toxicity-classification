First of all thank you for cleaning up my messages I am new to this and have already learnt a lot from you and about you
Second I reverted to VAS is based on Budans theorem but I still disagree with you Here are the reasons why A Sturm himself said 
mappuyant sur  by relying upon and not having been inspired by  B  In Greek to rely upon is βασίζομαι and there you can see the word βάση which means base I also leave it up to you to decide the wording for Sturms method and Fouriers theorem I simply cannot accept the word inspiration reminds me of religion
