Instruments  

It says that Kim Hyung Joong is able to play the violin I assume that this fact is based off when he played the violin during the drama Boys Over Flowers However if you watch closely you are able to see that he is not actually playing and merely miming I dont know if hes picked up the violin ever since but this should probably be removed from the list of instruments played
