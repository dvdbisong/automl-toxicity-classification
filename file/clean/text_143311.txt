New pic   nonjournalistic references 

Hi all A couple of suggestions for articles like this If we must use media as the only references at least in the short term can we lose the meaningless journalistic terminology 14 times closer is meaningless think twice as small Similarly gray line and water and carbon dioxide as elements These I have changed but Im sure there are others Finally couldnt someone modify the stock image used at the end to show where in the potentiallyhabitable zone this planet would lie ie add a ball 15 times the shown Earth size to the lower left of the zone That would be much more meaningful than the standard stock pic shown now Just a couple of thoughts
