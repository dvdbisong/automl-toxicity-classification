That is completely irrelevant The fact is that this page uses a definition which is not appropriate to a redirect regarding cities There is NO Government source which states that an urban subdivision is a city There are however Government sources which state that the entities named on the alternative page are cities There is no Westminster listed in the list on this page despite it having city status Why is this The simple fact is that the redirect stating that these are cities is blatantly inaccurate I am in the process of putting in a request for deletion on the redirect
