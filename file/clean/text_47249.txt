I agree with the geometry comment overall but it could be referred that some architects do use nonlinear geometry when they put the computer running cycles of calculations and iterations and even make use of fractal geometries I remember a project from Eisenmann where he made a mathematical model of some kind of a wind that created the whole form of his architecture
