With all due respect your comments about me taking the legal route are amusing The administrators here are hypocrites Guidelines instructions and policies for you all are fluid and subject to interpretation and if anyone questions this they are called ninnes but the same said policies are written in stone for other editors with threats of blocking if we even so much as approach violating the spirit of a guideline never mind a policy This is farsical Raul can go on enforcing his fluid FA guidelines and you can continue threatening people for pointing out the emperor has no clothes Im restricting my activity to watching the articles I wrote Ciao
