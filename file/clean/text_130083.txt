Recruitment section is ridiculous should be eliminated as its own section basic info included elsewhere in article rest in Bosniak SS article 

It goes into great detail about Bosniak SS units when they had at most a tangental relationship to the Mufti If worth mentioning at all in this article a short paragraph or even a sentence would suffice with a link to the article about the Bosniak SS units Why anyone thought it a good idea to include so much information about this topic in a biography of someone who played a very small role in it is beyond me unless they have an axe to grind against Muslims and want spend lots of time linking Nazism with Islam on any Wikipedia article related to the topic Its wellsourced and interesting material no doubt and does have some relationship to the subject of this entry but it belongs primarily in the Bosniak SS article not here
