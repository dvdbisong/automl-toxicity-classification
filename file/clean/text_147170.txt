Kings Theatre Portsmouth 

Sorry I was unable to find a way of replying as I am new to Wikipedia I am unsure what you mean about moving our prefered title to Kings Theatre Southsea This is causing troubles for us as many people use google to find us and is confusing the branding Is there anyway of changing the Title of Kings Theatre Southsea to Portsmouth as its the biggest problem of them all The ownership etc can be dealt with at a later date Many Thanks
