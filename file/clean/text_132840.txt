Comments on TSs suggestions 

For the record I think the writing of TS on the subject of homosexuality has balance and is well informed I think his emendations to the material that is in place now should be used in the article What he writes really fits the facts as I remember them 

Considering the article again I feel the section on Aesthetic Realism and Poetry is not clear Perhaps its been cut too much We dont know why a way of seeing the world based on poetry does what Aesthetic Realism says it does I can make some suggestions to clarify it
