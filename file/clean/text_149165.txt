Scope needed
There may be a need to split this off into various outlines This is mostly political andor military history at the moment so perhaps it should be retitled Theres some content on arts and culture in Western civilization that could be a separate outline Just speculating since there could eventually be more material added to the outline as it stands than would be manageable to work with I also notice that economic history is very neglected in the current outline that might be more useful to readers if it is a standalone outline Just what Im thinking anyway Anyone else have any thoughts
