No doubt but theres no strike or copyright warning at commons So  like you I dont really know much about the process of how the system detects copyrighted pictures etc If I understood commons better Id probably go to someone to have it looked at but Im not going to bother myself with that Im just gonna remove it as the user who uploaded lists that its his own work when in fact its Al Diazs picture from Miami Herald
