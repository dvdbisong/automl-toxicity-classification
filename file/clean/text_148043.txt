Introduction 

Stephens City celebrated its semiquincentennial or 250th anniversary on September 1 2008 A large section of the center of the town comprising 65 acres 26 ha is part of the NewtownStephensburg Historic District listed in 1992 on the National Register of Historic Places

This paragraph in the introduction consists of two completely unrelated subjects The 250th anniversary is already mentioned later in the article so this sentence can probably be removed The historic district sentence then could be incorporated somewhere else in the article In fact it is mentioned in the 20th century to present section so maybe we can move it there I will make these changes tomorrow if no one objects

Also as I mentioned in my edit comment I think the word semiquincentennial should be removed If a word is so obscure that you have to clarify what it means why not just use the clarification instead It looks a like a case of using a big word for the sake of using a big word Again I will make these changes tomorrow after giving ample time for comment Thanks
