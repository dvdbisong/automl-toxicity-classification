Yes but usually Variety indicates where their information comes from but in this case they dont which in turn renders the source unreliable Aside from the fact that since filming started he is not linked to the film when it is discussed in the media most sites dont include him in the cast altogether Given that he has not showed up on set for 3 months and is not mentioned in any press releases even though he is not commited to any movie right now his involvment is at least questionable and far from certain I would love him return but the probability shrinks with every day of filming
