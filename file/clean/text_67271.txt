Sjones23 yes I agree specifically english wikipedia have differences in the moments quite critical and sharp differences with other language wikis So yes I will need time to get into the way or how to say to learn these differences shorter saying But that doesnt means that Im wrong now in this specifical question And I dont wanted to offend or hurt somebody feelings If so Im sincererely apologize I just wanted to investigate And make improvements of english wiki  But I must say that you Sjones23 is quite doublefaced you change your opinions often You sating and agreeing that plot of PM is complicated and complex and after one day you saying that it is not so You should not do this Or this means cant to come to an agreement  You saidLets hope there are no more edit wars based on misunderstandings But if you will go from one side to another I hope you understand So I just kind advice to watch and keep your words And dont forget what admin Bbb23 said to youI strongly urge Sjones to stay away from the article for a while to prove his good faith I believe that you are respected editor but everyone can make mistakes and so on Rules guidelines etc are only one side of a coin Well I hope we understand ech other Again Im saying I dont want to offend somebody just saying my sincere vision and opinion Maybe some roughness 
 TheFarix really I didnt undersand totally You mean that there is fixed order in categories I read that rule but didnt understand it completely Will be glad if you can explain Thanks 
 Sjones23 about your sandbox version of plot I must say that I dont like it and reasons I telled earlier Look you write for exampleAfter Ashitaka returns the head to the deer god the land becomes green again and the accursed and lepers are restored to health San and Ashitaka part vowing to see each other as much as possible while Ashitaka finally freed of his curse decides to rebuild Tataraba Eboshi vows to rebuild Tataraba along more harmonious lines  what I see there its completely muddle misinterpret lie This is rough OR and distortion of what we really see in the film I hope you will understand And much places in your sandbox version like this example So I disagree must decline your version Reread please what I wrote to Elen about different variants point two Thank you and again sorry all comrades for my not perfect english must hurry just now dont have much time to sit with dictionary and correct all mistakes You can correct me if you want Best wishes
