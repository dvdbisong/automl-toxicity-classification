Mitt Romney
Im not sure if its really notable enough that Mitt Romney is a PPP descendant Any sixth or seventh generation Mormon could point out that a great deal of the population in the Salt Lake Valley alone carry his bloodline Heck I am but one of his many many many many descendants Why He was a polygamist with many wives who had many children Couple that with how many generations between him and the latest generation and you have a whole bucketful of Pratt blood running about I dont think its really significant that Mitt Romney is his great great grandson

I found this out in 4th grade back in Welby Elementary in South Jordan when my teacher asked the PPP descendants to raise their hands and well over a third of the hands went up including mine PPP descendancy isnt that uncommon in Utah and really isnt that noteworthy
