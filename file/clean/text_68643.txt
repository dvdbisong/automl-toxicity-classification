Alicante Airport 

Yes there is a good reason for that Although certain airlines such as EasyJet check in at T2 all airlines use the same security and departure lounge It is also struggling when airlines keep changing terminals they checkin The terminal list will be back in 2011 when T3 in alicante opens

Thanks and i hope this is ok
