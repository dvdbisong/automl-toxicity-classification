As I have always understood it U people are never sick or unwell Once in a lifetime they may admit to a chill after which any self respecting U person is expected to promptly die preferably quietly be put into a coffin and be buried in the churchyard A well born person never suffers from an ailment bravely endured passes gently away is placed into a silken casket or interred in the cemetery
