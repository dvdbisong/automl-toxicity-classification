Korean cuisine 2 

In regards to all of our past interactions my main issue with your editing of the article is what I believe to be the less than honest way in which you challenged the work of others and their integrity If you had taken the time to really discuss this as has been happening on the page since the end of the block I would have never stepped in and taken the actions I did 

Looking at the most recent changes you have made I have no issue with this current work as it seems you have taken the time to work on the article and not blank out that which you didnt agree with  blah blah  I did it 
Edit issues are not about defending your or my work and integrity  My concern has always been for accuracy of information conveyed in the article and about honest use of citations And of course I strongly disagree with your jist of our dispute but Im content to let the records on the talk page speak for themselves on that In any case happy editing
