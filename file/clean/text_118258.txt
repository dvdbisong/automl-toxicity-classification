Gregalton you know very well from your repeated edits deletes on debtbased monetary system that there is a distinction  Crunch is a cessation of lending in some debt markets FULL STOP  Squeeze is where debt is still being issued but with stricter requirements resulting in a slow down  but NOT a complete cessation of lending activity  Imagine a tap  One is where the tap is turned off  People starve theres chaos in the streets asset markets collapse you get the picture  The other is where the tap is turned to boiling hot so only those with 18 carat gold gloves on can receive this precious liquid called debt moneywhoopssorry that concept has been killed off by Gregalton and a few other WP guardians  Errprecious liquid called liquidity  Hows that sound

Where the tap is turned to boiling this generally only results in a slow down in economic growth and a contraction in prices in some isolated asset markets  Those asset markets that were receiving easy money prior to the squeeze get jammed but generally the economy hums along OK with isolated pockets of distress

I recommend someone work on credit squeeze to bring it up to WP standards not merge it to bring it down to the standard currently enjoyed on the credit crunch page  They are different concepts  Really  Truly
