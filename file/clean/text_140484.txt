Your personal assertion that a lot of people read the blog is not enough nothing is considered notable unless you can actually give real sources proving that the blog is significant  Just looking at hits or an Alexa rank is not enough internet pages can only be included if they have received significant coverage in the news or some other sort of media  You cant include the blog just because you think a lot of people like it
You claim that you are done being childishbut your insistence on calling Wikipedia a clusterfucked internet bureaucracy and my edits an ego trip lead me to believe you are not acting in good faith Â talkcontribs
