Pschemp Wikipedias responsible for this libel both here and in the discussion about it  I dont see what I want about it either  How a selfclaimed previously threatening 18yearold senior in high school can block a 42 yo CEO of a fellow 501c3 whos completed a graduatelevel class in generative syntax linguistics and done a lot of work on an article is beyond me   even has a runon sentence on his user page and very poor spelling all over the place including there  Whereas I got As and Bs in all 4yearcollege English requirements for graduation with a 4year degree I have to get bullied here to share ideas by someone with much less education and authority not to mention get falsely accused of things  My work brought the article up to a StartClass on the Wikipedia quality scale and Im the only one arguing who even claims to be a member of the Military history WikiProject let alone a candidate for coordinator there

I do feel defensive and granted Military history WikiProject coordinator would still not provide me with any executive powers  However it provides another reason for administrators to not want to block my account like they have making false accusations not even providing a warning overstepping their authority bullying  It appears to be one of the many flaws on Wikipedia flaws whose effects need much better mitigation or repair  Hopefully well manage it well but we arent right now thats for sure
