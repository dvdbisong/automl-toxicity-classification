All work I do will have to be on an unofficial basis 

I said earlier post that my contributions were pending approval and after speaking with my manager I am told that the company will not endorse the effort on wikipedia as they have thier hands full with RTDs own webpage I am told I cannot officially be approved to contribute on the grounds that I would have to be compensated for the work and they will not pay for something that would need constant update outside of the official webpage In a nutshell the small print is Im doing it of my own accord voluntarily and without promise or desire of compensation on my own time and with my own resources completely without the support or contribution of the company I will attempt to find some good photos but it will take time as my schedule is pretty packed
