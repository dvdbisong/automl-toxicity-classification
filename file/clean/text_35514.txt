No the mentioned editors activities are from what I have seen normal editing with which you disagree We all have to cope with that and I can assure you that we all find Wikipedia very annoying at times We do not check whether any of the recent contributors to an article have problems or disabilities before we decide to edit them If you find a subject area too stressful it would be better to take a break for a while If you were to continue with comments like those I linked to above you would eventually be sanctioned perhaps with a topic ban
