Update of the Article Chris Ojigbani
Thank you very much for helping me out in my article on Chris Ojigbani It was my very first article here and I learnt from your help After I read your message that I should put more references I put them Later I noticed that one of the refrences I put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article saying I should use secondary references That made me to suspect that the reference I picked from the website of Pastor Chris Ojigbani may be the cause of the tag I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US it stated his ministry is not a church But when I saw the tag I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbanis ministry is not a church But after changing it the tag is still on the article I dont know how to remove it Kindly help check the article and help remove the tags if okay
Once again thank you very much and have a prosperous new year
