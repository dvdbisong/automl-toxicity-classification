Tamar Braxton 

U R retardedHow can youtube not be a verifiable source I put a clip of her hitting a D and E one octave above Soprano CD7 and E7 and you say its not a good source What is then I bet if I even got a video of her hitting whistle notes youd say it wasnt verifiable Of course it it if you see or hear her hitting a whistle note then shes a whistle registre singer The same applies to all whsitle register singers U R just stupid U and Mr Ill bring the food who totally destroyed the Whsitle register singers category
