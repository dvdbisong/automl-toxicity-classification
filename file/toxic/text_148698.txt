Heres something for you to report  you have more poop in your pants Vandals are people who disrupt wikipedia like people who get bent out of shape over comments made on talk pages for IP address rather than focusing on something  Important They write condescending comments and put images of exclamation points in them and avoid communicating with other people like theyre people instead they use an impersonal language of templatestyle warnings sent like notices from bill collectors who would hypothetically also have poopie pants You may feel like youre being very noble by reporting this kind of comments to AIV and that when someone communicates with you in a way that youre not familiarly with or that makes you uncomfortable that its vandalism and personal attacks  But its really not its just an emerging bureaucratic culture preventing wikipedia from becoming a true form of social networking and collaboration Anyway go ahead go nuts pick on people different from you and have me banned Just remember it has nothing to do with vandalism and everything to do with Ethnocentrism and The Trial by Franz Kafka xoxoxoxoxo
