First of all who the fuck died and made you the god on what is and what is not plagiarism It seems like a pretty clear cut case to me If text from the article matches text found in another source word for word then it seems fairly clear cut that it is plagiarized I would also point out again for like the umpteenth fucking time that this user has been using plagiarized material repeatedly and only takes it out after being beaten over the head with it Secondly dont you fucking dare try and threaten me with what might and might not be said in arbitration Finally in case you were not aware or just did not care an AOL IP cannot be blocked so that is not any threat for the anon  2312 Feb 10 2005 UTC
